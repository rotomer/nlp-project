Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) OVERVIEW We believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth, particularly comparable sales growth (sales in warehouses open for at least one year). Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts they spend on each visit. Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations) and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions (primarily impacting domestic operations). The higher our comparable sales the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term. Another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, especially the United States. Sales growth and our gross margin are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, including a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenter stores, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, and internet based retailers. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private label items. Our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values. This may cause us, for example, to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members, negatively impacting gross margin. We also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and relocating existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. However, the negative aspects of such growth, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are ameliorated. Our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically, some significant costs are partially outside our control, most particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business is operated on low margins, modest changes in various items in the income statement, particularly gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income. Key items for 2011 included: Net sales increased 14.2% to $87,048, driven by a 10% increase in comparable sales and sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened in fiscal 2011. Net sales were favorably impacted by increases in the price of gasoline and by foreign currencies strengthening against the U.S. dollar; 21 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Membership fees increased 10.4% to $1,867, primarily due to the increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program and new membership sign ups; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points and included a pre tax last in, first out (LIFO) inventory charge of $87. There was no LIFO charge in 2010; Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 31 basis points; Net income attributable to Costco increased 12.2% to $1,462, or $3.30 per diluted share compared to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share in 2010. The previously mentioned LIFO charge negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.12; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share; We repurchased 8,939,000 shares of our common stock, at an average cost of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641; The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $4,000 of our common stock under a repurchase program expiring in April 2015; and In August 2011, we announced the retirement of Jim Sinegal as our Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2012. The Board of Directors elected Craig Jelinek, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2012. Mr. Sinegal will remain with Costco in an advisory role until February 2013. In addition, he will continue to serve on the Board of Directors. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Only the 2011 data in the accompanying tables includes Mexico. Results of Operations Net Sales 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 87,048 $ 76,255 $ 69,889 Net sales increase (decrease) 14.2 % 9.1 % (1.5 %) Increase (decrease) in comparable sales 10 % 7 % (4 %) Warehouse openings, net 20 13 15 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales Net sales increased $10,793 or 14.2% during 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding sales of Mexico, the increase would have been 11%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, and the remainder primarily from sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 (24 opened, and four closed, two due to relocation and two temporarily closed for repairs due to damage caused by the March 11, 2011 Japan earthquake, one of which remained closed as of the end of 2011). 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2011 by approximately $1,308, or 172 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price increases during 2011 by approximately $1,699, or 223 basis points, which resulted from a 24% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Our sales results continued to be impacted, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2010, by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Comparable Sales Comparable sales, including Mexico for both this year and last year, increased 10% during 2011, and were positively impacted by increases in the average amount spent by our members and in their shopping frequency. The strengthening of foreign currencies favorably impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,260, or 162 basis points during 2011. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $1,679, or 220 basis points during 2011. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Net sales increased $6,366 or 9.1% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 13 net new warehouses opened during 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately $1,570 or 225 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately $895, or 128 basis points, which resulted from a 17% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510, or 217 basis points, in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882, or 126 basis points, during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 2011 2010 2009 Membership fees $ 1,867 $ 1,691 $ 1,533 Membership fees increase 10.4 % 10.3 % 1.8 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.15 % 2.22 % 2.19 % Total cardholders (000s) 64,000 58,000 56,000 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2011 vs. 2010 Membership fees increased 10.4% in 2011. Excluding membership fees from Mexico, the increase would have been 8.3% in 2011. This increase was due to the higher penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program and the additional membership sign ups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011. Our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years, currently at 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted membership fees in 2011 by approximately $30. 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 net new warehouses opened in 2010. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2010 was 88% in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. Gross Margin 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 9,309 $ 8,260 $ 7,554 Gross margin increase 12.7 % 9.4 % 1.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.69 % 10.83 % 10.81 % 2011 vs. 2010 Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010. Gross margin for core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than total net sales, increased 18 basis points, primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries. However, when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales, it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales. The gross margin comparison was negatively impacted by $87 or 10 basis points due to a LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2011. The charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily food and sundries and gasoline. There was no LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2010. Excluding the impact of consolidating Mexico, the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin in 2011 by approximately $149. 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009. Gross Margin for core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable $32 LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no LIFO adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted gross margin by approximately $183. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,682 $ 7,840 $ 7,252 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.97 % 10.28 % 10.38 % 2011 vs. 2010 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the decrease was 11 basis points. The year over year decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs, largely payroll. This improvement was partially offset by a non recurring benefit of $24, or three basis points, recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability. The consolidation of Mexico, which compared to our other operating segments has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of its own net sales, favorably impacted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A during 2011 by approximately $116. 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales SG&A expense increased three basis points. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: a $24 refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability; and a $23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. Preopening Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Preopening expenses $ 46 $ 26 $ 41 Warehouse openings, including relocations 24 14 19 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March 15, 2012. Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year over year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Membership fees increased 10.4% to $1,867, primarily due to the increased penetration of the higher fee Executive Membership program and new membership sign ups; Gross margin (net sales less merchandise costs) as a percentage of net sales decreased 14 basis points and included a pre tax last in, first out (LIFO) inventory charge of $87. There was no LIFO charge in 2010; Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 31 basis points; Net income attributable to Costco increased 12.2% to $1,462, or $3.30 per diluted share compared to $1,303, or $2.92 per diluted share in 2010. The previously mentioned LIFO charge negatively impacted diluted earnings per share by $0.12; The Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share; We repurchased 8,939,000 shares of our common stock, at an average cost of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641; The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $4,000 of our common stock under a repurchase program expiring in April 2015; and In August 2011, we announced the retirement of Jim Sinegal as our Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2012. The Board of Directors elected Craig Jelinek, currently President and Chief Operating Officer, as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 1, 2012. Mr. Sinegal will remain with Costco in an advisory role until February 2013. In addition, he will continue to serve on the Board of Directors. Certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco. Only the 2011 data in the accompanying tables includes Mexico. Results of Operations Net Sales 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 87,048 $ 76,255 $ 69,889 Net sales increase (decrease) 14.2 % 9.1 % (1.5 %) Increase (decrease) in comparable sales 10 % 7 % (4 %) Warehouse openings, net 20 13 15 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales Net sales increased $10,793 or 14.2% during 2011 compared to 2010. Excluding sales of Mexico, the increase would have been 11%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales, and the remainder primarily from sales at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011 (24 opened, and four closed, two due to relocation and two temporarily closed for repairs due to damage caused by the March 11, 2011 Japan earthquake, one of which remained closed as of the end of 2011). 22 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2011 by approximately $1,308, or 172 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price increases during 2011 by approximately $1,699, or 223 basis points, which resulted from a 24% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Our sales results continued to be impacted, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2010, by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Comparable Sales Comparable sales, including Mexico for both this year and last year, increased 10% during 2011, and were positively impacted by increases in the average amount spent by our members and in their shopping frequency. The strengthening of foreign currencies favorably impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,260, or 162 basis points during 2011. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $1,679, or 220 basis points during 2011. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Net sales increased $6,366 or 9.1% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 13 net new warehouses opened during 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately $1,570 or 225 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately $895, or 128 basis points, which resulted from a 17% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510, or 217 basis points, in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882, or 126 basis points, during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 2011 2010 2009 Membership fees $ 1,867 $ 1,691 $ 1,533 Membership fees increase 10.4 % 10.3 % 1.8 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.15 % 2.22 % 2.19 % Total cardholders (000s) 64,000 58,000 56,000 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2011 vs. 2010 Membership fees increased 10.4% in 2011. Excluding membership fees from Mexico, the increase would have been 8.3% in 2011. This increase was due to the higher penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program and the additional membership sign ups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011. Our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years, currently at 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted membership fees in 2011 by approximately $30. 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 net new warehouses opened in 2010. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2010 was 88% in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. Gross Margin 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 9,309 $ 8,260 $ 7,554 Gross margin increase 12.7 % 9.4 % 1.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.69 % 10.83 % 10.81 % 2011 vs. 2010 Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010. Gross margin for core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than total net sales, increased 18 basis points, primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries. However, when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales, it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales. The gross margin comparison was negatively impacted by $87 or 10 basis points due to a LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2011. The charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily food and sundries and gasoline. There was no LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2010. Excluding the impact of consolidating Mexico, the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin in 2011 by approximately $149. 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009. Gross Margin for core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable $32 LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no LIFO adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted gross margin by approximately $183. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,682 $ 7,840 $ 7,252 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.97 % 10.28 % 10.38 % 2011 vs. 2010 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the decrease was 11 basis points. The year over year decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs, largely payroll. This improvement was partially offset by a non recurring benefit of $24, or three basis points, recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability. The consolidation of Mexico, which compared to our other operating segments has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of its own net sales, favorably impacted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A during 2011 by approximately $116. 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales SG&A expense increased three basis points. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: a $24 refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability; and a $23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. Preopening Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Preopening expenses $ 46 $ 26 $ 41 Warehouse openings, including relocations 24 14 19 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March 15, 2012. Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year over year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2011 by approximately $1,308, or 172 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price increases during 2011 by approximately $1,699, or 223 basis points, which resulted from a 24% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Our sales results continued to be impacted, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2010, by general economic conditions, and those conditions may continue to have an adverse impact on spending by our members. We believe, however, that due to the nature of our business model, we are better positioned than many retailers to compete in such an environment. Comparable Sales Comparable sales, including Mexico for both this year and last year, increased 10% during 2011, and were positively impacted by increases in the average amount spent by our members and in their shopping frequency. The strengthening of foreign currencies favorably impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,260, or 162 basis points during 2011. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $1,679, or 220 basis points during 2011. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). 2010 vs. 2009 Net Sales Net sales increased $6,366 or 9.1% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in comparable warehouse sales and the remainder primarily from sales at the 13 net new warehouses opened during 2010 (14 opened and one closed due to a relocation). Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted net sales during 2010 by approximately $1,570 or 225 basis points. Net sales were also positively impacted by gasoline price inflation during 2010 by approximately $895, or 128 basis points, which resulted from a 17% increase in the average sales price per gallon. Comparable Sales Comparable sales increased 7% in 2010 and were positively impacted primarily by an increase in shopping frequency. Strengthening foreign currencies positively impacted comparable sales by approximately $1,510, or 217 basis points, in 2010. Gasoline price inflation positively impacted comparable sales results by approximately $882, or 126 basis points, during 2010. Reported comparable sales growth includes the negative impact of cannibalization (established warehouses losing sales to our newly opened locations). Membership Fees 2011 2010 2009 Membership fees $ 1,867 $ 1,691 $ 1,533 Membership fees increase 10.4 % 10.3 % 1.8 % Membership fees as a percent of net sales 2.15 % 2.22 % 2.19 % Total cardholders (000s) 64,000 58,000 56,000 23 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2011 vs. 2010 Membership fees increased 10.4% in 2011. Excluding membership fees from Mexico, the increase would have been 8.3% in 2011. This increase was due to the higher penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program and the additional membership sign ups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011. Our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years, currently at 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted membership fees in 2011 by approximately $30. 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 net new warehouses opened in 2010. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2010 was 88% in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. Gross Margin 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 9,309 $ 8,260 $ 7,554 Gross margin increase 12.7 % 9.4 % 1.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.69 % 10.83 % 10.81 % 2011 vs. 2010 Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010. Gross margin for core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than total net sales, increased 18 basis points, primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries. However, when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales, it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales. The gross margin comparison was negatively impacted by $87 or 10 basis points due to a LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2011. The charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily food and sundries and gasoline. There was no LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2010. Excluding the impact of consolidating Mexico, the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin in 2011 by approximately $149. 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009. Gross Margin for core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable $32 LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no LIFO adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted gross margin by approximately $183. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,682 $ 7,840 $ 7,252 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.97 % 10.28 % 10.38 % 2011 vs. 2010 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the decrease was 11 basis points. The year over year decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs, largely payroll. This improvement was partially offset by a non recurring benefit of $24, or three basis points, recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability. The consolidation of Mexico, which compared to our other operating segments has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of its own net sales, favorably impacted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A during 2011 by approximately $116. 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales SG&A expense increased three basis points. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: a $24 refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability; and a $23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. Preopening Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Preopening expenses $ 46 $ 26 $ 41 Warehouse openings, including relocations 24 14 19 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March 15, 2012. Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year over year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2011 vs. 2010 Membership fees increased 10.4% in 2011. Excluding membership fees from Mexico, the increase would have been 8.3% in 2011. This increase was due to the higher penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program and the additional membership sign ups at the 20 net new warehouses opened during 2011. Our member renewal rates are consistent with recent years, currently at 89% in the U.S. and Canada, and approximately 86% on a worldwide basis. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted membership fees in 2011 by approximately $30. 2010 vs. 2009 Membership fees increased 10.3% in 2010 compared to 2009. Membership fees in 2010 were positively impacted due to the increased penetration of our higher fee Executive Membership program, the continued benefit of membership sign ups at warehouses opened in 2009, a 2009 $27 charge to membership fees related to a litigation settlement concerning our membership renewal policy, and the additional membership sign ups at the 13 net new warehouses opened in 2010. Our member renewal rate at the end of 2010 was 88% in the U.S. and Canada. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted membership fees by approximately $36. Gross Margin 2011 2010 2009 Gross margin $ 9,309 $ 8,260 $ 7,554 Gross margin increase 12.7 % 9.4 % 1.1 % Gross margin as a percent of net sales 10.69 % 10.83 % 10.81 % 2011 vs. 2010 Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 14 basis points compared to 2010. Gross margin for core merchandise categories (food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods), when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than total net sales, increased 18 basis points, primarily due to hardlines and food and sundries. However, when the core merchandise gross margin is expressed as a percentage of total net sales, it decreased two basis points from the prior year due primarily to the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business. Warehouse ancillary and other businesses gross margins decreased by two basis points as a percent of total net sales. The gross margin comparison was negatively impacted by $87 or 10 basis points due to a LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2011. The charge resulted from higher costs for our merchandise inventories, primarily food and sundries and gasoline. There was no LIFO inventory charge recorded in 2010. Excluding the impact of consolidating Mexico, the gross margin comparison as a percent of net sales would have been a decrease of 18 basis points during 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which positively impacted gross margin in 2011 by approximately $149. 2010 vs. 2009 Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased two basis points compared to 2009. Gross Margin for core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percent of core merchandise sales, rather than 24 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable $32 LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no LIFO adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted gross margin by approximately $183. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,682 $ 7,840 $ 7,252 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.97 % 10.28 % 10.38 % 2011 vs. 2010 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the decrease was 11 basis points. The year over year decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs, largely payroll. This improvement was partially offset by a non recurring benefit of $24, or three basis points, recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability. The consolidation of Mexico, which compared to our other operating segments has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of its own net sales, favorably impacted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A during 2011 by approximately $116. 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales SG&A expense increased three basis points. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: a $24 refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability; and a $23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. Preopening Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Preopening expenses $ 46 $ 26 $ 41 Warehouse openings, including relocations 24 14 19 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March 15, 2012. Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year over year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) total net sales, increased 25 basis points year over year, with all categories showing increases. However, the increased sales penetration of the lower margin gasoline business caused this increase to be only six basis points when expressed as a percent of total net sales. Warehouse ancillary businesses gross margins increased by three basis points as a percent of total net sales. In addition, gross margin comparisons were negatively impacted by five basis points due to a favorable $32 LIFO adjustment in 2009 compared to no LIFO adjustment in 2010. Increased penetration of the Executive Membership two percent reward program and increased spending by Executive Members negatively affected gross margin by two basis points. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar in 2010, which positively impacted gross margin by approximately $183. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 8,682 $ 7,840 $ 7,252 SG&A as a percent of net sales 9.97 % 10.28 % 10.38 % 2011 vs. 2010 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 31 basis points compared to 2010; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales, the decrease was 11 basis points. The year over year decrease was due to a 15 basis point improvement in our warehouse operating costs, largely payroll. This improvement was partially offset by a non recurring benefit of $24, or three basis points, recorded in fiscal 2010 related to the refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability. The consolidation of Mexico, which compared to our other operating segments has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of its own net sales, favorably impacted SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales by seven basis points in 2011. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A during 2011 by approximately $116. 2010 vs. 2009 SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales improved ten basis points compared to 2009; excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation on net sales SG&A expense increased three basis points. Warehouse operating costs, excluding the effect of gasoline price inflation, increased seven basis points, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs, particularly employee healthcare and workers compensation. SG&A expense comparisons were positively impacted by six basis points related to: a $24 refund of a previously recorded Canadian employee tax liability; and a $23 charge recorded in 2009 to write down the net realizable value of the cash surrender value of employee life insurance contracts with no comparable charge in 2010. Foreign currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted SG&A for 2010 by approximately $140. Preopening Expenses 2011 2010 2009 Preopening expenses $ 46 $ 26 $ 41 Warehouse openings, including relocations 24 14 19 25 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March 15, 2012. Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year over year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Preopening expenses include costs incurred for startup operations related to new warehouses and the expansion of ancillary operations at existing warehouses. Preopening expenses can vary due to the number of warehouse openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new, or international market. Provision for Impaired Assets and Closing Costs, Net 2011 2010 2009 Warehouse closing expenses $ 8 $ 6 $ 9 Impairment of long lived assets 1 2 8 Provision for impaired assets & closing costs, net $ 9 $ 8 $ 17 This provision primarily includes costs related to: impairment of long lived assets; future lease obligations, including contract termination costs, of warehouses that have been closed or relocated to new facilities; and accelerated depreciation, based on the shortened useful life through the expected closing date, on buildings to be demolished or sold and that are not otherwise impaired. The impairment charge in 2009 primarily related to the closing of our two Costco Home locations. At the end of 2011 and 2010, the reserve for warehouse closing costs was $5, and primarily related to future lease obligations and other contractual obligations associated with exiting the properties. Interest Expense 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 116 $ 111 $ 108 Interest expense primarily relates to our $900 of 5.3% and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes (2007 Senior Notes) issued in fiscal 2007. The 5.3% Senior Notes are due March 15, 2012. Interest Income and Other, Net 2011 2010 2009 Interest income $ 41 $ 23 $ 27 Earnings of affiliates and other, net 19 65 31 Interest income and other, net $ 60 $ 88 $ 58 2011 vs. 2010 The increase in interest income year over year was attributable to increases in our cash and cash equivalents, including short term investments, slightly higher interest rates, and the consolidation of our Mexico operations. The decrease in earnings of affiliates and other, net is primarily due to the previously discussed change in the accounting treatment of Mexico (see discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). In addition, there were net gains from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $9 and $14 during 2011 and 2010, respectively. See Derivatives section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 26 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) 2010 vs. 2009 The decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Interest income also includes a $12 other than temporary impairment loss recognized on certain securities within our investment portfolio in 2009. No impairment was recognized in 2010. The increase in earnings of affiliates and other was primarily due to an increase in earnings from Mexico, which increased due to stronger sales and the Mexican peso strengthening against the U.S. dollar. In addition, there were net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions and from derivative forward foreign currency contracts of $14 and ($5) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes 2011 2010 2009 Income tax expense $ 841 $ 731 $ 628 Effective tax rate 35.3 % 35.6 % 36.4 % The effective tax rate for 2011 was positively impacted by a tax refund received by Mexico. This benefit was offset by various discrete items recognized throughout the year. The decline in the effective tax rate from 2009 to 2010 was primarily attributable to a change in the mix of earnings between domestic and international operations. The 2009 effective tax rate also included the unfavorable impact of a write down on investments that were non deductible for tax purposes. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (dollars in millions, except per share data) Cash Flows The following table itemizes components of our most liquid assets: 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 4,009 $ 3,214 Short term investments 1,604 1,535 Total $ 5,613 $ 4,749 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from warehouse operations and cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances. Of these balances, approximately $982 and $862 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, represented debit and credit card receivables, primarily related to sales in the week prior to the end of our fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3,198 in 2011 compared to $2,780 in 2010, an increase of $418. This increase was primarily attributable to a $219 increase in net income including noncontrolling interests, an $87 increase from the change in other current operating assets and liabilities, a $77 increase in deferred income taxes, and a $60 increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in our net investment in merchandise inventories (merchandise inventories less accounts payable) of $70. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,180 in 2011 compared to $2,015 in 2010, a decrease of $835. This decrease in cash used was primarily attributable to an $896 decrease in cash used in the 27 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) net investment in short term investments and a $165 cash increase representing the cash and cash equivalents on Mexicos balance sheet as of August 29, 2010, partially offset by an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $235. Mexico was consolidated as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. See discussion in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,277 in 2011 compared to $719 in 2010, an increase of $558. This increase was primarily attributable to a $73 increase in cash used to repurchase Costcos common stock and a $519 reduction in the amount of bank checks outstanding. The reduction in bank checks outstanding is due to maintaining higher balances in banks on which our checks are drawn. Exchange rate changes increased cash and cash equivalents by $54 in 2011, compared to an increase of $11 in 2010, an increase of $43. This increase was due to the strengthening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar during 2011. Management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on cumulative undistributed earnings of $2,646 and $1,972 at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively, of certain non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities, including our 50% owned investment in Mexico, as such earnings are deemed by us to be indefinitely reinvested. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by these consolidated subsidiaries and other entities may not be available to be used for certain financing activities such as the repayment of short term debt or to repurchase common stock. At August 28, 2011, cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments of $1,828 were held by these non U.S. consolidated subsidiaries and other entities. Dividends In April 2011, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.205 to $0.24 per share. Our quarterly cash dividends paid in 2011 totaled $0.89 per share, as compared to $0.77 per share in 2010. 28 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Contractual Obligations As of August 28, 2011, our commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations were as follows: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Contractual obligations 2012 2013 to2014 2015 to2016 2017 andthereafter Total Purchase obligations (merchandise)(1) $ 5,879 $ $ $ $ 5,879 Long term debt(2) 1,011 126 126 1,329 2,592 Operating leases(3) 183 357 317 1,850 2,707 Purchase obligations (property, equipment, services and other)(4) 324 71 19 414 Construction commitments 191 191 Capital lease obligations(2) 13 26 26 311 376 Other(5) 5 4 2 32 43 Total $ 7,606 $ 584 $ 490 $ 3,522 $ 12,202 (1) Includes open merchandise purchase orders. (2) Includes contractual interest payments. (3) Operating lease obligations exclude amounts commonly referred to as common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance and have been reduced by $183 to reflect sub lease income. (4) The amounts exclude certain services negotiated at the individual warehouse or regional level that are not significant and generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Consists of $31 in asset retirement obligations, $9 in deferred compensation obligations and $3 of current unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions. The total amount excludes $50 of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments. Expansion Plans Our primary requirement for capital is the financing of land, buildings, and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses. To a lesser extent, capital is required for initial warehouse operations and working capital. While there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review, it is our current intention to spend approximately $1,400 to $1,600 during fiscal 2012 for real estate, construction, remodeling, and equipment for warehouses and related operations. These expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. We plan to open up to 20 net new warehouses in 2012, and at least one relocation of an existing warehouse to a larger and better located facility. In addition, the closed warehouse in Japan is expected to re open in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We opened 20 net new warehouses in 2011 and spent $1,290 on capital expenditures. 29 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs Credit FacilityDescription ExpirationDate Credit Line Activity atAugust 28, 2011 ApplicableInterestRate Entity Total ofall CreditFacilities Stand byLetter ofCredit(LC) &Letter ofGuaranty CommercialLC Short TermBorrowing AvailableCredit U.S. UncommittedStandby LC N/A $ 17 $ 17 $ $ $ N/A U.S. UncommittedCommercial LC N/A 50 21 29 N/A Australia(1) Guarantee Line N/A 10 2 8 N/A Canada(1)(3) Multi PurposeLine N/A 30 22 8 2.35 % Japan(1)(4) Revolving Credit February 12 72 72 0.58 % Japan(1) Bank Guaranty March 12 20 20 N/A Japan(1) Revolving Credit February 12 46 46 0.58 % Japan(2) Commercial LC N/A 1 1 N/A Korea(1) Multi PurposeLine March 12 11 1 1 9 4.39 % Mexico Commercial LC October 11 3 3 N/A Mexico Commercial LC N/A 3 3 N/A Taiwan Multi PurposeLine January 12 24 10 14 2.75 % Taiwan Multi PurposeLine July 12 17 3 14 2.79 % United Kingdom UncommittedMoney MarketLine N/A 32 32 3.10 % United Kingdom UncommittedOverdraft Line N/A 49 49 1.50 % United Kingdom(2) Letter ofGuarantee N/A 3 3 N/A United Kingdom Commercial LC N/A 3 1 2 N/A TOTAL $ 391 $ 79 $ 22 $ $ 290 (1) The U.S. parent company, Costco Wholesale Corporation, guarantees this entitys credit facility.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes.

Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities.

A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds.

Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.

At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively.

Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business.

The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge our exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries or other entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. These contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features. We seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships. There can be no assurance, however, that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk. These contracts are limited to less than one year in duration. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the fair value of open, unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts as of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010. We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively. 
 
Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Financing Activities In March 2011, we reclassified our $900 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012, originally issued in February 2007, to a current liability within the current portion of long term debt within the consolidated balance sheets to reflect its maturity of less than one year. Upon maturity, we intend to repay the outstanding principal balance and associated interest with our existing liquidity sources of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances. In April 2010, our Japanese subsidiary paid the outstanding principal and interest balances totaling $44 related to the 0.92% promissory notes due April 2010, originally issued in April 2003. In June 2008, our Japanese subsidiary entered into a ten year term loan in the amount of $39, with a variable rate of interest of Yen TIBOR (6 month) plus a 0.35% margin (0.79% and 0.84% at the end of 2011 and 2010, respectively) on the outstanding balance. Interest is payable semi annually in December and June and principal is due in June 2018. In October 2007, our Japanese subsidiary issued promissory notes through a private placement in the amount of $85, bearing interest at 2.695%. Interest is payable semi annually, and principal is due in October 2017. We guarantee all of the financial instruments issued by our Japanese subsidiary. In February 2007, we issued $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes due March 15, 2012 (2012 Notes) at a discount of $2 and $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (2017 Notes) at a discount of $6 (together the 2007 Senior Notes). Interest on the 2007 Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and issuance costs associated with the 2007 Senior Notes are being amortized to interest expense over the terms of those notes. At our option, we may redeem the 2007 Senior Notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the 2007 Senior Notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, we will be required to make an offer to purchase the 2007 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon certain events as defined by the terms of the 2007 Senior Notes. In August 1997, we sold $900 principal amount at maturity 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes (Zero Coupon Notes) due in August 2017. The Zero Coupon Notes were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $450. The remaining Zero Coupon Notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of 878,000 shares of Costco Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $22.71. Holders of the Zero Coupon Notes may require us to purchase the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of purchase) in August 2012. At our option, we may redeem the Zero Coupon Notes (at the discounted issue price plus accrued interest to date of redemption) any time after August 2002. As of August 28, 2011, $862 in principal amount of Zero Coupon Notes had been converted by note holders into shares of Costco Common Stock, of which the principal converted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 is detailed in the table below: 2011 2010 2009 Principal converted during period $ 3 $ 1 $ 25 Principal converted, including the related debt discount $ 2 $ 1 $ 19 Shares issued upon conversion (000s) 65 18 562 32 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Derivatives We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of business.

We are exposed to risks due to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume, particularly electricity and natural gas, which we seek to partially mitigate through the use of fixed price contracts for approximately 36% of our warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and thus require no mark to market adjustment. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements. Stock Repurchase Programs In April 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, expiring in April 2015, bringing total authorizations by our Board of Directors since inception of the program in 2001 to $10,800. The authorization in April 2011 revoked previously authorized but unused amounts totaling $792. During 2011, we repurchased 8,939,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $71.74 per share, totaling approximately $641. During 2010, we repurchased 9,943,000 shares of common stock, at an average price of $57.14 per share, totaling approximately $568. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $3,706 at the end of 2011. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5 1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments. We continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue 33 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) recognition, investments, merchandise inventory valuation, impairment of long lived assets, warehouse closing costs, insurance/self insurance liabilities, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize sales, net of estimated returns, at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services. When we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services, the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed. We provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns, net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs. Amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are the primary obligor, subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, influence product or service specifications, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. If we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above, we record the net amounts as commissions earned, which is reflected in net sales. Membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by our members. We account for membership fee revenue, net of estimated refunds, on a deferred basis, whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period. Our Executive members qualify for a 2% reward (which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses), up to a maximum of approximately $500 per year, on qualified purchases made at Costco. We account for this 2% reward as a reduction in sales, with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities. The sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data. Investments Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. We employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and or issuer conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Merchandise Inventories Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, as determined primarily by the retail inventory method, and are stated using the last in, first out (LIFO) method for substantially all U.S. merchandise inventories. Merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. We believe the LIFO method 34 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues. We record an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end. Due to inflation, in 2011 the merchandise inventories valued at LIFO were lower than the FIFO value, resulting in a charge to merchandise costs of $87. During 2009, due to overall net deflationary trends, the Company recorded a $32 benefit to merchandise costs to adjust inventories valued at LIFO. At the end of 2010 and 2009, merchandise inventories valued at LIFO approximated FIFO after considering the lower of cost or market principle. We provide for estimated inventory losses (shrink) between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales. The provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts, which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Inventory cost, where appropriate, is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates, provided they are probable and reasonably estimable. Other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones, terms of agreement, or other systematic and rational approaches. Impairment of Long Lived Assets and Warehouse Closing costs We periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment, such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility. Our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist, requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value. We provide estimates for warehouse closing costs for leased and owned locations to be closed or relocated. Judgment is involved in determining any impairment or our net liability, particularly related to the estimated sales price of owned locations and the potential sublease income at leased locations. These estimates are based on real estate conditions in the markets and our experience in those markets. We make assumptions about the average period of time it would take to sublease the location and the amount of potential sublease income for each leased location. We reassess our liability each quarter and adjust our liability accordingly when our estimates change. Insurance/Self Insurance Liabilities We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation, general liability, property damage, directors and officers liability, vehicle liability, and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate. 35 Table of Contents Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (dollars in millions, except per share and warehouse number data) (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements See discussion of Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured corporate notes, and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. The majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities. These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations. A revised investment policy was approved in December 2007 by our Board of Directors, limiting future investments to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, and U.S. government and government agency money market funds. The investment policies of our subsidiaries are consistent with our primary objective to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields. Our wholly owned insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations, corporate notes and bonds, and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of AA. All of our foreign subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds, investment grade securities, bankers acceptances, bank certificates of deposit and term deposits, all denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, our Canadian subsidiary may invest a portion of its investments in U.S. dollar investment grade securities and bank term deposits to meet current U.S. dollar obligations. Because most of our investments in cash and cash equivalents are short term, interest rate changes are less likely to be material to our financial statements. Based on our overnight investments and bank balances within cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2011 and 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $29 and $23 (pre tax), respectively, to interest income on an annual basis. For those investments that are classified as available for sale, the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. The nature and amount of our long and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of the end of 2011, our fixed rate long term debt included: $1,100 of 5.5% Senior Notes carried at $1,097; $900 of 5.3% Senior Notes carried at $900; $38 principal amount at maturity of 3.5% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes carried at $31; and additional notes totaling $86. Additionally, our variable rate long term debt included a 0.35% over Yen Tibor (6 month) Term Loan of $39. Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long and short term debt. 36 Table of Contents Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk (Continued) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign subsidiaries conduct limited transactions in their non functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively.

We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, seeking to hedge the impact of fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a foreign currency. As of August 28, 2011, and August 29, 2010, we held forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of $247 and $225, respectively. At the end of 2011, the fair value of assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets were $1 and $2, respectively. At the end of 2010, the fair value of assets and liabilities were $1 and $3, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2011 and August 29, 2010, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $25 and $23, respectively.
