Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Overview We operate our business through five segments: Medical Devices includes the development, manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments, soft tissue repair products, energy devices, oximetry and monitoring products, airway and ventilation products, vascular devices, sharpsafety products, clinical care products and other medical device products. Pharmaceutical Products includes the development, manufacture and distribution of dosage pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients and specialty chemicals. Imaging Solutions includes the development, manufacture and marketing of radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products. Medical Supplies includes the development, manufacture and sale of nursing care products, medical surgical products, original equipment manufacturer products (OEM), incontinence products in Europe and other medical supply products. Retail Products includes the development, manufacture and marketing of infant care products, incontinence products in the United States, feminine hygiene products and other retail products. Covidien Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. Until June 29, 2007, however, Covidien did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. As part of a plan to separate Tyco International into three independent companies, Tyco International transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to Covidien and, on June 29, 2007, distributed all of its shares of Covidien to its shareholders. Where we refer to financial results for fiscal 2007, these results reflect the consolidated operations of Covidien Ltd. from June 29, 2007 to September 28, 2007 and, for all periods prior to June 29, 2007, a combined reporting entity comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing Tyco International Ltd.s healthcare business. Please see our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information. Our financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to June 29, 2007 may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what our combined results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented. Certain general corporate overhead, other expenses and debt and related net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt have been allocated to us by Tyco International for periods prior to the Separation. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual expenses we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company for the periods presented. Note 17 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provides additional information regarding allocated expenses. 42 Table of Contents Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations Product Recalls During fiscal 2006, our results were adversely affected by quality systems and regulatory compliance issues that led to product recalls within the Imaging Solutions segment and to a detention order imposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that blocked the import and sale in the U.S. of several temperature monitoring products within our Medical Devices segment that we manufacture at a facility in Mexico. In addition, we were unable to produce certain Imaging Solutions products for a period of time, which adversely affected our sales and manufacturing performance, resulting in underabsorption of manufacturing overhead costs. In certain instances, despite the fact that we were not able to manufacture the product, we were able to obtain alternative sources, but at higher costs. In response to these quality systems and regulatory compliance issues, we made substantial capital and headcount investments during fiscal 2006. We increased our quality and regulatory assurance personnel at the affected facilities in an effort to address all of the FDAs concerns. We resumed sales for the majority of the affected Imaging Solutions products in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and the detention was lifted on our temperature monitoring products. Sales of technetium generators within the Imaging Solutions segment were suspended, however, in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we initiated a voluntary recall of such generators manufactured on or after February 23, 2007, as a result of a potential problem identified during routine testing of a production run. This issue was resolved before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and production of technetium generators resumed on April 2, 2007. There is a risk following any recall or production suspension that we will not be able to regain some of the customers who moved to alternate suppliers. Other Manufacturing Cost Increases We use resins, other petroleum based materials and pulp as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gas and pulp prices are volatile and increased in fiscal 2007 and 2006, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. As a result of these cost increases, in October 2007 we announced our intent to increase prices in our Retail Products segment by approximately four to seven percent. This price increase will affect the baby diaper and training pant product lines and will be effective in February 2008. We cannot, however, provide any assurance as to how long this price increase will remain in effect. Patent Infringement Settlement In fiscal 2006, we paid a total of $330 million, which represented $264 million in damages in a patent infringement action for sales through January 31, 2006, and $66 million as an advance royalty for oximetry sales from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. The adverse effect of the damage settlement charge is reflected in our fiscal 2005 operating results. We stopped selling the infringing products on February 1, 2006, and agreed to pay an ongoing royalty for oximetry sales. Sales and Marketing Investment Selling and Marketing expenses increased approximately $179 million and $43 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount and related compensation programs. The increase in headcount is to support the continuation of our geographic expansion and our increased focus on selling to and supporting customers directly rather than through distributors. We expect selling and marketing expenses to continue to increase in fiscal 2008 as we build our global sales force and strengthen our brand name. 43 Table of Contents Research and Development Investment Our research and development expense, including in process research and development, decreased $13 million during fiscal 2007 and increased $93 million during fiscal 2006. We expect these expenditures associated with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third party, to increase as we continue to make additional investments to support our growth initiatives. We intend to focus our internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Restructuring Initiative During fiscal 2007, we launched a restructuring program in our Medical Devices, Medical Supplies and Retail Products segments. These programs include numerous actions designed to improve our competitive position by exiting unprofitable product lines in low growth and declining growth markets, reducing excess machine capacity, moving production to lower cost alternatives through plant consolidations and outsourcing initiatives, and relocating certain functions to locations that will enhance our recruiting, development and retention of personnel and lower operating costs. We expect to incur charges of $150 million under this program, most of which is expected to occur by the end of 2008. We expect the savings from these restructuring initiatives to partially offset the increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses necessary to support our growth initiatives. During fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $58 million as we began to consolidate certain facilities, primarily in the Medical Devices segment. Possible Strategic Divestitures As part of our management of Covidien, we regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. To the extent one or more of our businesses is determined to be non strategic and or underperforming, we may engage in the evaluation and possible execution of strategic alternatives for these businesses, including, if attractive or appropriate, a sale or divestiture of one or more of these businesses. We have made strategic divestitures in the past, as discussed under Discontinued Operations, and we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including sales or divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses. If executed, any such sales or divestitures, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Further, depending on the consideration received for a sale or divestiture transaction, we could incur an impairment charge which may or may not have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Currency Exchange Rates Approximately 38% of our net sales are reported in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2007 is as follows: U.S. Dollar 62 % Euro 18 Japanese Yen 6 All Other 14 100 % 44 Table of Contents Currency exchange rates also affect our cost of products sold. To the extent other currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, transaction losses result on any products sourced from the U.S. for sale in such non U.S. currencies. Tyco International Factors Influencing the Results of Operations Class Action Settlement On May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 class action lawsuits. The Memorandum of Understanding does not address all securities cases, and several remain outstanding. In addition, the proposed settlement does not release claims arising under ERISA. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the plaintiffs have agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration of the payment of $2.975 billion from Tyco International to the certified class. See Note 18 for more information. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement. Additionally, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International, for which no tax benefit was realized. This amount is comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million, of which, $42 million has been collected. Both amounts are consistent with our sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. At September 28, 2007, we had a $2.992 billion class action settlement liability for the full amount owed under the settlement, which includes accrued interest on the liability, and a $1.740 billion receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics for their portions of the liability. The $1.740 billion receivable is included in Class action settlement receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. Borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility and cash were used to fund our portion of the payment into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. Interest in class action settlement fund in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007 represents our $1.257 billion interest in Tyco Internationals funds held in escrow to settle the class action lawsuits. The escrow account earns interest that is payable to the class. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 10,170 100.0 % $ 9,647 100.0 % $ 9,535 100.0 % Cost of products sold 5,333 52.4 5,161 53.5 4,835 50.7 Gross profit 4,837 47.6 4,486 46.5 4,700 49.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,537 24.9 2,081 21.6 2,325 24.4 Research and development expenses 274 2.7 262 2.7 232 2.4 In process research and development charges 38 0.4 63 0.7 Class action settlement, net of insurance recoveries 1,202 11.8 Impairments of long lived assets 290 2.9 Restructuring and other charges, net 58 0.6 (Gain) loss on divestitures, net (48 ) (0.5 ) 5 0.1 Operating income 438 4.3 2,128 22.1 2,138 22.4 Interest expense 188 1.8 171 1.8 196 2.1 Interest income (36 ) (0.4 ) (32 ) (0.3 ) (30 ) (0.3 ) Other expense, net 135 1.3 15 0.2 248 2.6 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 151 1.5 1,974 20.5 1,724 18.1 Income taxes 488 4.8 504 5.2 531 5.6 (Loss) income from continuing operations (337 ) (3.3 ) 1,470 15.2 1,193 12.5 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5 0.0 315 3.3 158 1.7 Net (loss) income $ (342 ) (3.4 ) $ 1,155 12.0 $ 1,035 10.9 Net sales Our net sales in fiscal 2007 increased $523 million, or 5.4% to $10.170 billion, compared with $9.647 billion in fiscal 2006, with growth across all segments except Retail Products, whose sales were adversely impacted by our strategic decision to exit several low margin private label supply contracts. Currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the Euro, contributed $201 million to the increase in net sales. In fiscal 2006, net sales increased 1.2% as compared with fiscal 2005 to $9.647 billion, with growth across our Medical Devices, Pharmaceutical Products and Retail Products segments. Our Imaging Solutions segment was adversely affected by product recalls, while our Medical Supplies segment lost some large GPO contracts and faced increased competition in the alternate site market from lower cost producers (primarily manufacturers in China). The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed $13 million to the increase in net sales, while currency exchange rate fluctuations adversely affected fiscal 2006 net sales by $93 million. Net sales generated by our businesses in the U.S. were $6.1 billion, $6.0 billion and $6.0 billion in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our non U.S. businesses generated net sales of $4.0 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our business outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 40%, 38% and 37% of our net sales for the fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 46 Table of Contents Net sales by geographic area for each of the last three fiscal years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions): PercentageChange 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 United States $ 6,128 $ 6,008 $ 6,040 2.0 % (0.5 )% Other Americas 491 443 385 10.8 15.1 Europe 2,492 2,198 2,171 13.4 1.2 Japan 584 579 594 0.9 (2.5 ) Asia Pacific 475 419 345 13.4 21.4 $ 10,170 $ 9,647 $ 9,535 5.4 1.2 Costs of products sold Cost of products sold was 52.4% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared with 53.5% of net sales in fiscal 2006. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percent of net sales for fiscal 2007 was attributable to lower costs in the Retail Products segment, due to our strategic decision to exit several low margin private label supply contracts, and favorable sales mix in our Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Products segments. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs and incremental royalties associated with a legal settlement in our Medical Devices segment. Cost of products sold was 53.5% of net sales in fiscal 2006 compared with 50.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase in cost of products sold in fiscal 2006 as a percentage of net sales is attributable to unfavorable manufacturing overhead variances in our Imaging Solutions and Medical Devices segments as a result of lower manufacturing volumes and increased spending on quality systems and service associated with the product recalls, incremental royalties in our Medical Devices segment associated with a legal settlement, increased fuel surcharges and transportation costs related to the increase in oil prices across all segments, and higher raw material costs across all segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $456 million, or 21.9%, to $2,537 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $2,081 million in fiscal 2006. Selling and marketing expenses increased $179 million, primarily due to incremental headcount in the non U.S. salesforce within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, incremental domestic employee compensation costs contributed $61 million to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Further contributing to the increase were costs of approximately $53 million stemming from the Separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $244 million, or 10.5%, to $2,081 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $2,325 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 benefited from the absence of the $277 million charge recorded in fiscal 2005 for a legal settlement. In addition, the percentage of corporate overhead allocated to us by Tyco International declined in fiscal 2006, resulting in a decrease of $44 million of allocated overhead. Partially offsetting these improvements was an increase in field selling expenses of approximately $47 million due to incremental headcount, primarily in the non U.S. sales force within our Medical Devices segment, as well as the recognition of $37 million of incremental share based compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2006 in connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share Based Payment. Research and development expense Research and development expense increased $12 million, or 4.6%, to $274 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $262 million in fiscal 2006, despite the realization of savings associated with restructuring activity in our Medical Devices segment. As a percent of our net sales, research and development expense remained at 2.7% during fiscal 2007 and 2006. Research and development expense increased $30 million, or 12.9%, in fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expense increased to 2.7% in fiscal 2006 from 2.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2005. 47 Table of Contents Class action settlement, net of insurance recovery As previously discussed under Class Action Settlement, in fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1,202 million by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recovery. Impairments of long lived assets In fiscal 2007, we recorded a total impairment charge on long lived assets of $290 million, of which, $256 million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with the Retail Product segment, as well as a non cash charge of $33 million for the impairment of a non amortizable trademark associated with our Imaging Solutions segment. The impairment of goodwill associated with the Retail Products segment reflects a lower fair value of the segment based on continued adverse trends in raw materials and energy costs, and a higher discount rate to reflect current market conditions. The impairment of the non amortizable trademark associated with the Imaging Solution segment is due to a shift in branding strategy that will result in discontinuing the use of the trademark. Restructuring charges In fiscal 2007, we began to consolidate certain facilities under the restructuring program previously discussed, and recorded restructuring charges of $58 million, primarily related to severance costs and non cash charges for asset impairments in our Medical Devices segment. In process research and development charge In fiscal 2007, we recorded charges of $38 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx, LLC and the acquisition of Airox S.A. In fiscal 2006, we recorded charges of $63 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with acquisitions, $49 million of which related to the acquisition of Confluent Surgical, Inc. More information regarding in process research and development charges related to the Confluent acquisition is provided under Acquisitions, and Critical Accounting Policies Business Combinations. (Gain) loss on divestitures, net In fiscal 2006, we recorded a net gain on divestitures of $48 million, $45 million of which relates to the sale of our Radionics product line within our Medical Devices segment. Operating income In fiscal 2007, operating income decreased $1,690 million to $438 million, compared with operating income of $2,128 million in fiscal 2006. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1,202 million allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recovery. The remaining $488 million decrease in operating income was attributable to the inclusion of long lived asset impairment of $290 million, an increase in selling and marketing expense of $179 million, primarily due to incremental headcount in the non U.S. salesforce within the Medical Devices segment, restructuring charges of $58 million and the absence of a gain on the divestiture of our Radionics product line of $45 million that was recorded in fiscal 2006. Further contributing to the decline in operating income were costs of approximately $53 million stemming from the Separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. Higher sales, increased gross profit and a $25 million decrease in in process research and development charges partially offset the increase in operating expenses. In fiscal 2006, operating income decreased $10 million to $2,128 million, compared with operating income of $2,138 million in fiscal 2005. Our operating margin was 22.1% in fiscal 2006 compared to 22.4% in fiscal 2005. Although our fiscal 2006 operating margin benefited from the absence of a $277 million legal settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2005 and a decrease of $44 million of allocated corporate overhead from Tyco International, our operating income declined. Our operating margin in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by raw material price increases, increased research and development expense, including $63 million of in process research and development charges, product recalls, other incremental manufacturing costs associated with investments in quality systems and regulatory compliance, higher fuel surcharge costs related to increased oil prices, incremental costs associated with our sales force and research and development investments, and the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 48 Table of Contents Analysis of Operating Results by Segment Net sales by segment for each of the last three fiscal years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions): PercentageChange 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 Medical Devices $ 6,161 $ 5,711 $ 5,585 7.9 % 2.3 % Pharmaceutical Products 1,330 1,219 1,156 9.1 5.4 Imaging Solutions 942 870 938 8.3 (7.2 ) Medical Supplies 993 992 1,026 0.1 (3.3 ) Retail Products 744 855 830 (13.0 ) 3.0 $ 10,170 $ 9,647 $ 9,535 5.4 1.2 Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for each of the last three fiscal years is shown in the following table (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2007 2006 2005 Medical Devices $ 1,731 28.1 % $ 1,824 31.9 % $ 1,649 29.5 % Pharmaceutical Products 339 25.5 300 24.6 310 26.8 Imaging Solutions 87 9.2 123 14.1 223 23.8 Medical Supplies 144 14.5 143 14.4 174 17.0 Retail Products (195 ) (26.2 ) 44 5.1 84 10.1 Corporate (1,668 ) (306 ) (302 ) $ 438 4.3 $ 2,128 22.1 $ 2,138 22.4 Medical Devices Net sales Net sales in fiscal 2007 increased $450 million, or 7.9%, to $6,161 million, compared with $5,711 million in fiscal 2006. Currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $161 million to the increase in net sales. Net sales increased across all product groups, particularly within Endomechanical Instruments, Energy Devices and Soft Tissue Repair Products. Endomechanical Instruments net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $131 million, or 7.6%, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $60 million. Growth in Endomechanical Instruments was driven by continued demand for our Autosuture laparoscopic instruments in Europe and the U.S. Energy Devices net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $106 million, or 20.3%, primarily due to continued market growth of vessel sealing products, and to a lesser extent, new product launches in capital equipment and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations. Soft Tissue Repair Products net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $73 million, or 17.3%, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $19 million. The increase in Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily due to strong sales of biosurgery products in the U.S. Net sales increased $126 million, or 2.3%, to $5,711 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $5,585 million in fiscal 2005. Currency exchange rate fluctuations adversely affected fiscal 2006 net sales by $82 million, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed $30 million to net sales. Net sales increased across all product groups, particularly within Endomechanical Instruments, Energy Devices and Soft Tissue Repair Products. Endomechanical Instruments net sales for fiscal 2006 increased $52 million, or 3.1%, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a unfavorable impact of $29 million. Growth in Endomechanical Instruments was driven by continued demand for our Autosuture laparoscopic instruments in Europe and the U.S. Energy Devices net sales for fiscal 2006 increased $48 million, or 10.1%, primarily due to continued market 49 Table of Contents penetration of new vessel sealing products, and to a lesser extent, continued volume growth in electrosurgery disposable products and additional sales personnel during the year offset by reduced volumes in electrosurgery equipment as the impending launch of the ForceTriad caused certain customers to halt their purchases of the existing controller units and unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations. Soft Tissue Repair Products net sales for fiscal 2006 increased $36 million, or 9.4%, primarily due to an increase in sale volume in Japan as a result of new product launches and continued growth in market share for sutures offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations. Operating income Operating income decreased $93 million, or 5.1%, to $1,731 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $1,824 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 28.1% for fiscal 2007, compared with 31.9% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in our operating income and margin was attributable to an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $173 million primarily related to an increase in sales force headcount, the absence of a gain on the divestiture of the Radionics product line of $45 million recorded in fiscal 2006 and restructuring charges of $54 million. Increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance discussed above and a decrease in in process research and development charges of $25 million partially offset the increase in operating expenses. Operating income in fiscal 2006 increased $175 million, or 10.6%, to $1,824 million, while operating margin was 31.9% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 29.5% in fiscal 2005. Operating income and margin for fiscal 2006 benefited from the absence of a $277 million legal settlement recorded in fiscal 2005 and a $45 million gain resulting from the sale of our Radionics product line in fiscal 2006. Excluding these benefits, operating margin declined in fiscal 2006 primarily due to in process research and development charges of $63 million, incremental costs associated with our sales force and research and development investments of $50 million and increased royalty expense of $34 million due to a legal settlement. Pharmaceutical Products Net sales Net sales increased $111 million, or 9.1%, to $1,330 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $1,219 million in fiscal 2006. Net sales increased across all product groups. Specialty Chemicals net sales increased $45 million due to higher sales volume of pharmaceutical chemicals worldwide and laboratory chemicals in the United States. In addition, Dosage Pharmaceuticals net sales increased $31 million, primarily due to higher sales volume of brand pharmaceuticals. Net sales of Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients increased $35 million due to stronger demand for narcotic products and acetaminophen. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations also contributed to the increase in net sales for the segment. Net sales increased $63 million, or 5.4%, to $1,219 million, in fiscal 2006, compared with $1,156 million in fiscal 2005. Net sales increased across all product groups, particularly Specialty Chemicals. Specialty Chemicals net sales in fiscal 2006 increased $38 million, compared with fiscal 2005. Sales levels were favorably affected by strong demand for microelectronic chemicals in both the United States and Korea, which resulted in an increase of $34 million. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) net sales in fiscal 2006 increased $13 million as compared to fiscal 2005. Sales levels were favorably affected by an increase in volume of bulk narcotics which more than offset price decreases. The favorable performance of bulk narcotics primarily was driven by strong demand for natural opiates, partially offset by lower sales of synthetic narcotics. Dosage Pharmaceuticals net sales increased $12 million in fiscal 2006 resulting from increased sales volume of generic pharmaceuticals which was partially offset by capacity limitations and decreased price of generic pharmaceuticals. In fiscal 2006, Dosage Pharmaceuticals experienced an increase in backlog due to capacity limitations. Backlog reached as high as $15 million in mid fiscal 2006, compared to a historical average of $1 million. The primary factors contributing to the backlog increase were additional volume demand for generic pharmaceuticals, the late start up of the dosage production facility expansion and an inventory planning control system conversion. The decline in generic pharmaceutical sales was partially offset by an increase in sales of branded pharmaceuticals due to price increases. 50 Table of Contents Operating income Operating income increased $39 million, or 13.0%, to $339 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $300 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 25.5% for fiscal 2007, compared with 24.6% for fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales and gross profit due to favorable sales mix and plant performance resulting from cost reduction programs. Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $10 million, or 3.2%, to $300 million, compared with $310 million in fiscal 2005, and as a percentage of sales decreased to 24.6% in fiscal 2006 from 26.8% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing plant performance driven by higher energy costs. Cost decreases, primarily on nitrobenzene, a major raw material, partially offset the declines to operating income. Imaging Solutions Net sales Imaging Solutions net sales increased $72 million, or 8.3%, to $942 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $870 million in fiscal 2006. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $19 million to the net sales increase and was experienced across all product groups. Radiopharmaceuticals net sales increased $54 million due to higher sales volume of technetium generators that were under a voluntary recall during a portion of the previous period and higher sales volume from GPO contracts. Net sales for Imaging Solutions decreased $68 million, or 7.2%, in fiscal 2006, resulting from lower volumes and price and product mix. Currency exchange rate fluctuations also adversely affected net sales. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to radiopharmaceutical product recalls and, to a lesser extent, sales declines of Contrast Products. Radiopharmaceuticals net sales declined $50 million, or 10.6%, of which $22 million is due to reduced sales of technetium generators as a result of product recalls. In addition, sales of other associated Radiopharmaceutical product lines also were adversely affected by the recalls because customers generally purchase a complete line of radiopharmaceutical products from the same vendor. Contrast Products net sales declined $18 million, or 3.9%, in fiscal 2006 primarily driven by lower non ionic contrast media prices and a favorable distributor price adjustment received in fiscal 2005. The net sales decrease was partially offset by market growth, European expansion and higher sales in France and Spain. Operating income Operating income for Imaging Solutions decreased $36 million, or 29.3%, to $87 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $123 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 9.2% for fiscal 2007, compared with 14.1% for fiscal 2006. The primary decrease in operating income was due to impairment of an indefinite lived trademark resulting in a $33 million charge. Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $100 million, or 44.8%, to $123 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased from 23.8% in fiscal 2005 to 14.1% in fiscal 2006. Product recalls resulted in a $52 million decrease to operating income. Lost sales on related products as a result of the recalls and remediation costs in our radiopharmaceuticals facility also contributed to the significant decrease in operating income. In addition, price declines and the favorable distributor price adjustment in fiscal 2005 adversely affected the year over year comparison of operating income. Medical Supplies Net sales Net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $1 million, or 0.1%, to $993 million, compared with $992 million for fiscal 2006. Currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased sales of Nursing Care Products, driven by pricing strategies at alternative site markets, contributed to the increase in net sales. These increases were partially offset by the impact of a product line divested in the prior year. Net sales in fiscal 2006 decreased $34 million, or 3.3% to $992 million, compared with $1,026 million in fiscal 2005 due to a $20 million decrease resulting from two divested product lines. In addition, Nursing Care Products net sales decreased $13 million as a result of lower sales volumes primarily due to a loss in market share as GPOs switched from a predominately sole source contracting approach to a multi source approach. In 51 Table of Contents addition, increased competition in the alternate site markets for wound care resulted in market share losses to lower cost competitors who manufacture in China. Operating income Operating income of $144 million for fiscal 2007 remained relatively level with operating income for fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 14.5% for fiscal 2007, compared with 14.4% for fiscal 2006. Strong plant cost reduction programs helped offset increasing raw material costs. Operating income decreased $31 million, or 17.8%, to $143 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $174 million in fiscal 2005. Our operating margin for Medical Supplies decreased to 14.4% in fiscal 2006 from 17.0% in fiscal 2005. The decrease in operating income primarily related to increased manufacturing costs of $19 million largely due to higher raw material costs (nonwoven and pulp) and a decrease in sales volume which adversely affected operating income by $15 million. Retail Products Net sales Net sales for fiscal 2007 decreased $111 million, or 13.0%, to $744 million, compared with $855 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to a sales decline in Infant Care Products of $106 million, driven by our strategic decision to exit several low margin supply contracts. Despite a challenging operating environment of intense competition, net sales increased $25 million, or 3.0%, in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Infant Care Products net sales in fiscal 2006 increased $21 million, compared with fiscal 2005 as a result of new product sales and market share gains in Mexico and Latin America, partially offset by market share loss in the United States. Operating (loss) income Operating losses for fiscal 2007 of $195 million decreased $239 million compared with operating income of $44 million in fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a non cash charge of $256 million related to the impairment of goodwill recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. This charge was partially offset by improved gross profit due to a more favorable sales mix as the result of our strategic decision to exit several low margin supply contracts. Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $40 million, or 47.6%, to $44 million, compared with $84 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to an increase in raw material and fuel surcharge costs of $51 million driven by increased oil prices. Price erosion, resulting from competitive pressure in the market place driven by internet auctions, and product mix also contributed to the decline in operating income. These declines were partially offset by cost reductions driven by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses resulting primarily from our cost reduction programs. Corporate Corporate expense During fiscal 2007, Corporate expense increased $1,362 million, to $1,668 million, compared with $306 million for fiscal 2006. Corporate expense for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1,202 million allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recovery. The primary drivers of the remaining $160 million increase in Corporate expense consisted of $53 million of costs stemming from the Separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. In addition, other general and administrative costs increased $75 million primarily driven by higher legal and environmental expenses and employee compensation costs. Corporate expense increased $4 million to $306 million in fiscal 2006, compared with fiscal 2005 due to incremental stock option charges of $37 million required under SFAS No. 123R in fiscal 2006. In addition, fiscal 2006 was unfavorably affected by the absence of a favorable reserve adjustment recorded in fiscal 2005. These increases were offset by a decrease of $44 million in allocated expenses from Tyco International resulting from a decline in our allocation percentage. 52 Table of Contents Non Operating Items Interest Expense and Interest Income During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, interest expense was $188 million, $171 million and $196 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $93 million, $144 million and $161 million, respectively. We expect to see an increase in interest expense during fiscal 2008 due to the additional debt to finance our portion of Tyco Internationals class action settlement. In addition, during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, interest income was $36 million, $32 million and $30 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $16 million, $20 million and $11 million, respectively. Other Expense, net During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 other expense, net was $135 million, $15 million and $248 million, respectively. Tyco International has allocated to us a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $146 million and $243 million for fiscal 2007 and 2005, respectively. The method utilized to allocate loss on retirement of debt is consistent with the method used to allocate debt and net interest expense as described above. Income Taxes Income tax expense was $488 million, $504 million and $531 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $151 million, $1,974 million and $1,724 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 323.2%, 25.5% and 30.8% for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to charges related to the net class action settlement and loss on allocated early extinguishment of debt, for which no tax benefit was realized. In addition, the rate was adversely impacted by a goodwill impairment charge, for which only a portion was tax deductible, and the impact of certain tax costs incurred in connection with our separation from Tyco International and other adjustments to legacy income tax liabilities. These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate due to a release in deferred tax valuation allowances related to changes in non U.S. tax law. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily the result of a one time benefit associated with a favorable tax ruling in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 permitting deduction of debt retirement costs, an increase in income earned outside the U.S. and taxed at lower rates and adjustments to accrued tax liabilities offset by an increase in valuation allowances. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2006, the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and the A&E Products business were sold for $975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business were $2 million, which does not include working capital adjustments that were agreed upon in fiscal 2007. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. During fiscal 2006, we recorded a $260 million and $26 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre tax impairment charges to write the businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreements. During fiscal 2007, an additional $30 million was collected from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses pursuant to a post closing adjustment related to the decline in average 53 Table of Contents resin prices, and $6 million was received from the purchaser of the A&E Products business for working capital adjustments. Divestiture In January 2006, we completed the sale of the Radionics product line within our Medical Devices segment, which included minimally invasive medical instruments in the fields of neurosurgery and radiation therapy. In connection with this sale, we received net proceeds of $74 million and recorded a gain of $45 million in continuing operations in fiscal 2006. Acquisitions Fiscal 2007 In April 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired intellectual property from Sorbx, a developer of an absorbable tack technology used in hernia repair procedures, for $30 million. This acquisition expands our surgical devices portfolio and will allow us to leverage our global distribution capabilities. We recorded an in process research and development charge of $30 million in connection with the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx. This charge related to the development of second generation technology that had not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition date, the in process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Airox in a mandatory tender offer for approximately $47 million. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $19 million of in process research and development charges, of which $8 million was recorded in fiscal 2007. These charges related to the development of second generation technology which had not yet obtained regulatory approval. As of the acquisition dates, the in process research and development was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use and, therefore, was written off at those dates. Fiscal 2006 During fiscal 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane for $123 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $3 million, of which $122 million, net of cash acquired of $3 million, was paid during the first six months of fiscal 2006. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded in process research and development charges of $3 million during the first six months of fiscal 2006. There were no additional in process research and development charges during fiscal 2006 associated with this acquisition. In August 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired Confluent, a developer and supplier of polymer based technology used in sprayable surgical sealants and anti adhesion products. This acquisition allows us to offer bio surgery products that complement our Syneture suture and Autosuture surgical stapler portfolio. The total purchase price is expected to be $246 million. As of September 29, 2006, we have paid $200 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $12 million. We have also deposited $34 million of the total purchase price into an escrow account, $10 million of which was released to Confluents shareholders in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 upon determination of closing balance sheet adjustments, and the remainder of which we expect to be released in fiscal 2008 upon expiration of the indemnification period. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded a $49 million in process research and development charge in fiscal 2006 related to technology Confluent is developing for numerous applications across several surgical disciplines which have not yet received regulatory approval. As of the date of the Confluent acquisition, there were three projects under development at different stages of completion, none of which were considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. 54 Table of Contents We determined the valuation of the in process research and development using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the projects and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates applied range from 20% to 23%, depending on the projects stage of completion and the type of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval required. In September 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired over 50% ownership of Airox S.A. for $59 million in cash, net of cash acquired of $4 million. In connection with this acquisition, during fiscal 2006 we recorded $11 million of in process research and development charges. Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures and investments in businesses and technologies. Historically, we have generated positive cash flow from operations. However, we expect to have negative cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 when the class action settlement is paid. This payment will not affect our cash balance as the funds have been set aside in an escrow account. Through the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of Tyco International, our cash was swept regularly by Tyco International at its discretion. Tyco International also funded our operating and investing activities as needed. Transfers of cash both to and from Tyco Internationals cash management system have been reflected as a component of Parent company investment within Parent Company Equity in the Combined Balance Sheet at September 29, 2006. Subsequent to the Separation, we received an $85 million true up payment from Tyco International to adjust for differences between our cash balance at June 29, 2007 and our final cash allocation in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. This amount is included in Net transfers to parent company in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flow. Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. Fiscal 2007 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by operating activities of $2,209 million was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2007, as adjusted for the net class action settlement charge, depreciation and amortization, impairment of long lived assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt, non cash compensation expenses and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $276 million, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. Our cash flow provided by operating activities will be adversely affected in 2008 upon finalization of the litigation settlement. This impact will be entirely offset in investing activities upon the release of the escrow deposit which was funded in fiscal 2007. The net cash used in investing activities of $1,744 million was primarily due to our interest in the class action settlement fund of $1,257 million, capital expenditures of $388 million and acquisition activity of $117 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Airox and the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx. The net cash provided by financing activities of $145 million was primarily the result of the issuance of external debt of $4,298 million discussed in Capitalization below, partially offset by allocated debt activity of $2,291 million, net transfers to parent of $1,319 million and the repayment of external debt of $525 million also discussed in Capitalization below. Fiscal 2006 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by operating activities of $1,335 million was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2006, as adjusted for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, the loss from discontinued 55 Table of Contents operations, purchased research and development and non cash compensation expense. This source of cash was partially offset by a $376 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, driven by payments of $324 million for two patent infringement matters, a decrease in income taxes payable of $263 million and an increase in inventories of $212 million. The net cash used in investing activities of $780 million was primarily due to capital expenditures of $432 million and business acquisitions of $382 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $74 million from the sale of our Radionics product line. Acquisition spending increased $316 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 to support our growth initiatives. The net cash used in financing activities of $461 million was primarily the result of change in parent company investment of $601 million and allocated debt activity of $548 million, partially offset by transfers from discontinued operations of $634 million, largely due to net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations. Fiscal 2005 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by operating activities of $2,212 million was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2005, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, allocated loss on retirement of debt and loss from discontinued operations and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $256 million attributable to accruals for patent infringement settlements. The net cash used in investing activities of $379 million was primarily due to capital expenditures of $331 million, which increased $80 million as compared to fiscal 2004. In addition, we acquired Vivant for $66 million. The net cash used in financing activities of $1,864 million was primarily the result of allocated debt activity of $1,141 million and change in parent company investment of $508 million. In addition, we repaid $244 million of external debt. Capitalization At September 28, 2007, total debt was $4.088 billion, all due to third parties, compared with total debt at September 29, 2006 of $2.442 billion of which $2.144 billion was due to Tyco International Ltd. and affiliates. Tyco Internationals consolidated debt, exclusive of amounts incurred directly by us, was proportionately allocated to us at September 29, 2006 based on the amount that management believed we used historically. Management believes the allocation basis for debt is reasonable based on our historical financing needs. However, this amount may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company. In April 2007, Tyco International and certain of its subsidiaries that are issuers of its corporate debt commenced tender offers to purchase for cash substantially all of their outstanding U.S. dollar denominated public debt. Our 6.5% notes due November 2007 and 7.0% debentures due December 2013 were subject to these tender offers. Approximately $161 million, or 86%, of these notes were tendered. In April 2007, we entered into a five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility. The commitment under the credit facility is $1.500 billion. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin dependent on our credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. We are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility of $724 million were used to repay a portion of the bridge loan facility. Following the draw downs, we had $776 million of available capacity under the revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. 56 Table of Contents Additionally, in April 2007, we entered into a $3.200 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. The bridge facility matures in April 2008. Interest and fees under the bridge facility are substantially the same as those under the revolving credit facility. The bridge facility contains provisions that may require mandatory prepayments or reduction of unused commitments if we issue debt or equity. In May 2007, we increased the amount of this facility by $1.050 billion, bringing the total facility to $4.250 billion. Borrowings under the unsecured bridge loan facility were used to fund a portion of Tyco Internationals debt tender offers, to repay a portion of Tyco Internationals bank credit facilities and to finance a portion of Tyco Internationals class action settlement. In October 2007, we completed a private placement offering of $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes, comprised of the following: $250 million of 5.15% notes due 2010; $500 million of 5.45% notes due 2012; $1.150 billion of 6.0% notes due 2017; and $850 million of 6.55% notes due 2037. The net proceeds of $2.727 billion were used to repay a portion of our borrowings under our unsecured bridge loan facility. Our credit and bridge facility agreements contain a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreements contain other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Certain of our operating subsidiaries have uncommitted overdraft and similar types of facilities, which total $132 million, the majority of which was available at September 28, 2007. Generally, these facilities expire annually and most are renewable and are established primarily within our non U.S. operations. Dividends On September 28, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 9, 2007. The dividend was paid on November 9, 2007. We expect that we will continue to pay comparable dividends to holders of our common shares. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for external debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 28, 2007 is presented in the following table (dollars in millions). Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter External debt(1) $ 6,617 $ 589 $ 170 $ 169 $ 413 $ 880 $ 4,396 Capital leases(1) 147 20 18 19 32 20 38 Operating leases 413 98 77 57 45 37 99 Purchase obligations(2) 184 81 21 19 19 15 29 Holdback liabilities(3) 26 26 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 7,387 $ 814 $ 286 $ 264 $ 509 $ 952 $ 4,562 (1) Includes interest on fixed rate debt and capital leases. The table has been updated to reflect the private placement offering of long term fixed rate senior notes entered into in October 2007. Note 21 to the 57 Table of Contents Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provides further information regarding the private placement offering. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services. (3) Holdback liabilities primarily relate to the fiscal 2006 acquisition of Confluent. (4) Because the timing of their future cash outflows is uncertain, other liabilities of $805 million, primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, insurable liabilities and deferred compensation, are excluded from this table. The minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be $28 million in fiscal 2008. In addition, we expect to pay $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to our postretirement benefit plans. At September 28, 2007, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $151 million. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Note 18 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provides further information regarding legal proceedings. Prior to the announcement of the Separation, Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in several lawsuits relating to securities class action, shareholder lawsuits and Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to this outstanding litigation were allocated among Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. We are responsible for 42% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the settlement of such pending litigation. If Tyco International or Tyco Electronics were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts. As previously discussed under Class Action Settlement, on May 14, 2007, Tyco International entered into a Memorandum of Understanding for a class actions settlement with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 class action lawsuits for the payment of $2.975 billion to the certified class. Under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the class action settlement, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International, for which no tax benefit was realized. This amount is comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recovery of $47 million. The portion allocated to us was consistent with our sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. At September 28, 2007, we had a $2.992 billion class action settlement liability for the full amount owed under the settlement, which includes accrued interest on the liability, and a $1.740 billion receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics for their portions of the liability. The $1.740 billion receivable is included in Class action settlement receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. Borrowings under our unsecured bridge loan facility and cash were used to fund our portion of the payment into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. Interest in class action settlement fund in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007 represents our $1.257 billion interest in Tyco Internationals funds held in escrow to settle the class action lawsuits. 58 Table of Contents If the proposed settlement were not consummated on the agreed terms or if the unresolved class action lawsuits were determined in a manner adverse to Tyco International, it is possible that our portion of such liability would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Moreover, Tyco International stipulated, pursuant to a court order, that we will be primarily liable for a portion of the obligations arising from the Tyco International shareholder litigation. The stipulation also provides that if any party defaults on its obligations, the other parties will be jointly and severally liable for those obligations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the amount of loss or probable losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of these matters. Income Taxes Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with such examinations, tax authorities, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco Internationals, including Covidiens and Tyco Electronics, U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agents Reports (RARs) in May and June of 2007 which reflect the IRSs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. The RARs propose tax audit adjustments to certain of Tyco Internationals previously filed tax return positions, all of which Tyco International and Covidien expected and previously assessed at each balance sheet date. Accordingly, we made no additional provision during fiscal 2007 with respect to our share of the proposed audit adjustments contained in the RARs. It is our understanding that Tyco International will appeal other proposed tax adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and Tyco International intends to vigorously defend its prior filed tax return positions. We believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements relating to our share of these tax adjustments are adequate. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, ultimate resolution of these matters could result in Tyco International filing amended U.S. federal income tax returns for years subsequent to the current 1997 to 2000 audit period and could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate in future reporting periods. We may also be required to accrue and pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to Covidien as a result of the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. In fiscal 2004, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to the U.S. federal income tax returns for the 1997 through 2000 fiscal years, resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. During fiscal 2006, the IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments. Also during fiscal 2006, Tyco International developed proposed amendments to U.S. federal income tax returns for additional periods through 2002. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we determined that acceptance of these adjustments is probable and, accordingly, recorded the adjustments in our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. These adjustments resulted in a $285 million decrease in non current deferred income tax assets and a $269 million decrease to non current income taxes payable in fiscal 2006. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or our ongoing effective tax rate. Tyco International has yet to complete proposed amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for periods subsequent to fiscal 2002, which will primarily reflect the roll forward of the amendments for fiscal 1997 through fiscal 2002. When our tax return positions are updated, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. We are the primary 59 Table of Contents obligor to the taxing authorities for $517 million of these contingent tax liabilities which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not occur for several years. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we recorded a long term receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics of $306 million which is classified as Due from related parties in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2007. This receivable primarily reflects 58% of the $517 million contingent tax liabilities, excluding a portion which is not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to the Company under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. If any party to the Tax Sharing Agreement were to default in its obligation to another party to pay its share of distribution taxes that arise as a result of no partys fault, each non defaulting party would be required to pay, equally with any other non defaulting party, the amounts in default. In addition, if another party to the Tax Sharing Agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of such tax liabilities were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority, we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and be required to make additional tax payments. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities, of which we assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International with the assistance of a third party valuation firm in accordance with FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others and accordingly, liabilities amounting to $760 million were recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2007, the offset of which was reflected in Shareholders Equity. To the extent such recorded liabilities change, the increase or decrease will be reflected in Other expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in future periods. Prior to Separation, Tyco International made a payment to the IRS as an advance against certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Our share of the payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement was $192 million. This payment had the effect of reducing our liabilities recorded for guarantee arrangements and indemnifications entered into with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement. In addition, this payment reduced our cash balance upon Separation. Certain of our business segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for financial commitments. Recourse, as it relates to these guarantees, indicates we will, in the event of customer default, buy back a transaction from a customer financing partner at a predetermined discount of the remaining payments. Using historical data of previous loss levels, a risk percentage is assigned to recourse transactions to estimate required liabilities. Full credit reviews are performed to assess risk and liability requirements on individual, large transactions. The total exposure under specific recourse and risk sharing guarantees and related liabilities at September 28, 2007 was not significant. The potential exposure for 60 Table of Contents non performance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. Note 18 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements provides further information with respect to these liabilities. We are liable for product performance, however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non U.S. jurisdictions. In certain circumstances, we enter into arrangements in which we provide multiple deliverables to our customers. Agreements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting. Total revenue is first allocated among the deliverables based upon their relative fair values. Revenue is then recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the principles described above. Fair values are determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties. We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in our reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. In estimating rebate accruals, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor specific trend analysis, contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment against net product sales revenue in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2007 amounted to approximately $2.1 billion. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first in, first out) or market value. We reduce the carrying value of inventory based on estimates of what is excess, slow moving and obsolete, as well 61 Table of Contents as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These write downs are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If future market conditions and actual demands ultimately are less favorable than those projected, we would further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made. Actual results historically have not differed materially from managements estimates. Property, Plant and Equipment Management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of property, plant and equipment relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. We assess the recoverability of assets using undiscounted cash flows. If an asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets fair value. The fair value is estimated based upon the present value of discounted estimated future cash flows or other reasonable estimates of fair value. Fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment, there is a risk that the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment may be overstated or understated. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology. We record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment which is described above. Business Combinations Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. Purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. We expense the value attributable to in process research and development projects at the time of acquisition. The valuation of in process research and development is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of in process research and development, we consider, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. Goodwill In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and 62 Table of Contents market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. When conducting an annual goodwill impairment test, we utilize a two step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. During fiscal 2007, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $256 million within the Retail Products segment. There were no goodwill impairments related to continuing operations during 2006 and 2005. Goodwill impairments included in loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2005 totaled $162 million. Contingencies We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 18 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is known. Accordingly, we are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore we record the minimum amount, which could be zero. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. We record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $29 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on 63 Table of Contents plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. Guarantees We have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the maximum potential payments are not material. We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. See Note 11 for more information. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain unless it becomes more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $447 million and $197 million at September 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. If a change in a valuation allowance occurs, which was established in connection with an acquisition, such adjustment may reduce goodwill rather than the income tax provision. At September 28, 2007, approximately $22 million of the valuation allowances will ultimately reduce goodwill if the net operating losses are utilized. Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These tax liabilities are reflected 64 Table of Contents net of related tax loss carryforwards. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the tax liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business, the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition. Management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by these taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. Substantially all of these potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current Income taxes in the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We presently use a measurement date of August 31. SFAS No. 158 also requires additional financial statement disclosures. We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007, and accordingly recognized an after tax reduction of $51 million through shareholders equity. We have not yet adopted the measurement date provisions which become effective in fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact the measurement date provisions will have on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS 141(R) expands the definition of a business combination and requires acquisitions to be accounted for at fair value. These fair value provisions will be applied to contingent consideration, in process research and development and acquisition contingencies. Purchase accounting adjustments will be reflected during the period in which an acquisition was originally recorded. Additionally, the new standard requires transaction costs and restructuring charges to be expensed. SFAS 141(R) is effective for us for acquisitions closing during and subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 141(R) on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than at historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS No. 159 will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us in fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS No. 157 will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. We are currently assessing the impact FIN 48 will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 65 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, benefits resulting from our separation from Tyco International, the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements. The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts. Foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use forward currency exchange contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing forward contracts outstanding at September 28, 2007, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 28, 2007 market rates would increase the unrealized value of our forward contracts on our balance sheet by $142 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of forward contracts on our balance sheet by $174 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. Interest rate risk primarily results from variable rate debt obligations. At September 28, 2007, our variable rate debt instruments as a percentage of total debt instruments was 30%. Based on a sensitivity analysis of the variable rate financial obligations in our debt portfolio as of September 28, 2007, it is estimated that a 25 basis point interest rate movement in the average market interest rates (either higher or lower) in fiscal 2008 would either decrease or increase interest expense by approximately $3 million. Over time, we may seek to adjust the percentage of variable rate financial obligations in our debt portfolio through the use of swaps or other financial instruments.
