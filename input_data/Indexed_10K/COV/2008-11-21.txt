Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Overview We operate our continuing businesses through the following four segments: Medical Devices includes the development, manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments, soft tissue repair products, energy devices, oximetry and monitoring products, airway and ventilation products, vascular devices, SharpSafety products, clinical care products and other medical device products. Imaging Solutions includes the development, manufacture and marketing of radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products. Pharmaceutical Products includes the development, manufacture and distribution of dosage pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients. Medical Supplies includes the development, manufacture and sale of nursing care products, medical surgical products and original equipment manufacturer products (OEM). Covidien Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. Until June 29, 2007, however, Covidien did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. As part of a plan to separate Tyco International into three independent companies, Tyco International transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to Covidien and, on June 29, 2007, distributed all of its shares of Covidien to its shareholders. Our financial results reflect the consolidated operations of Covidien Ltd. as an independent publicly traded company following June 29, 2007, and a combined reporting entity comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing Tyco International Ltd.s healthcare businesses, including Covidien Ltd., prior to and including June 29, 2007. Our financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For periods prior to the separation, certain general corporate overhead, other expenses, debt and related net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt have been allocated to us by Tyco International. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual expenses we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company. Note 17 to our financial statements provides additional information regarding allocated expenses. 36 Table of Contents Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures As part of our management of Covidien, we regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. We have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions as well as divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses. Acquisitions During fiscal 2008, our Medical Devices segment acquired Tissue Science Laboratories plc (TSL) for $74 million. TSL is a medical device company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of tissue implant products for surgical and wound care therapies. The acquisition of TSL provides us with a leading tissue repair technology and accelerates our entry into the biologic hernia repair market. TSLs Permacol(R) product complements our current soft tissue product offerings and allows us to offer a full line of differentiated hernia repair products. In November 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired Scandius Biomedical, Inc. (Scandius), a developer of medical devices for sports related surgeries, for $27 million. The acquisition of Scandius enables us to offer customers innovative soft tissue repair devices for common sports injuries. In April 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired intellectual property from Sorbx, LLC (Sorbx), a developer of an absorbable tack technology used in hernia repair procedures, for $30 million. The acquisition of the intellectual property from Sorbx will allow us to expand our surgical devices portfolio, while leveraging our global distribution capabilities. In September 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired 59% ownership of Airox S.A. (Airox) for $59 million and in November 2006, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Airox in a mandatory tender offer for $47 million. Airox is a developer of home respiratory ventilator systems. The acquisition of Airox expands our ventilator product portfolio. In August 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired Confluent Surgical, Inc. (Confluent), a developer and supplier of polymer based technology used in sprayable surgical sealants and anti adhesion products, for $236 million. The acquisition of Confluent allows us to offer bio surgery products that complement our Syneture suture and Autosuture surgical stapler portfolio. During fiscal 2006, our Medical Devices segment acquired over 90% ownership in Floreane Medical Implants, S.A. (Floreane) for $123 million. Floreane, through its Sofradim line, is an innovator in the development of hernia meshes and surgical implants. The acquisition of Floreane expands our surgical product portfolio and allows us to provide our customers with a complementary range of products, while leveraging our global distribution capabilities. Subsequent to fiscal 2006, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Floreane for $12 million. Divestitures During fiscal 2008, we approved a plan to sell our Specialty Chemicals business within the Pharmaceutical Products segment and sold our Retail Products segment and our European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment. We decided to sell these businesses because their products and customer bases are not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. These businesses all met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and, accordingly, have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations for further information. 37 Table of Contents In January 2006, we completed the sale of our Radionics product line within the Medical Devices segment, which included minimally invasive medical instruments in the fields of neurosurgery and radiation therapy. In connection with this sale, we received net proceeds of $74 million and recorded a gain of $45 million in continuing operations. Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations Sales and Marketing Investment Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $303 million and $186 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount and related compensation programs. The increase in headcount is to support the continuation of our geographic expansion and our increased focus on selling to and supporting customers directly rather than through distributors. Research and Development Investment Our research and development expense increased $81 million during fiscal 2008 and increased $12 million during fiscal 2007. We expect these expenditures associated with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third party, to increase as we continue to make additional investments to support our growth initiatives. We intend to focus our internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Restructuring Initiatives During fiscal 2007, we launched a $150 million restructuring program, primarily in our Medical Devices segment. This program includes numerous actions designed to improve our competitive position by exiting unprofitable product lines in low growth and declining growth markets, reducing excess machine capacity, moving production to lower cost alternatives through plant consolidations and outsourcing initiatives, and relocating certain functions to locations that will enhance our recruiting, development and retention of personnel and lower operating costs. We expect the savings from these restructuring initiatives to partially offset the increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses necessary to support our growth initiatives. During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $77 million and $57 million, respectively, as we consolidated certain facilities, primarily within the Medical Devices segment. On September 26, 2008, we approved another restructuring program also designed to improve our cost structure and to deliver improved operational growth. This program, which will be launched in fiscal 2009, includes actions in all four segments, as well as at corporate. We expect to incur charges as these actions are undertaken of approximately $200 million under this program, most of which is expected to occur by the end of 2010. Manufacturing Cost Increases We use resins, other petroleum based materials and pulp as raw materials in many of our products. Prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. Oil, gas and pulp prices are volatile and have increased in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, resulting in higher costs to produce and distribute our products. 38 Table of Contents Currency Exchange Rates Our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2008 is as follows: U.S. Dollar 57 % Euro 20 Japanese Yen 6 All Other 17 100 % Currency exchange rates also affect our cost of goods sold. To the extent other currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, transaction losses result on any products sourced from the United States in U.S. dollars which are then sold in non U.S. currencies. Product Recalls During fiscal 2006, our results were adversely affected by quality systems and regulatory compliance issues that led to product recalls within the Imaging Solutions segment and to a detention order imposed by the FDA that blocked the import and sale in the United States of several temperature monitoring products within our Medical Devices segment that we manufacture at a facility in Mexico. In addition, we were unable to produce certain Imaging Solutions products for a period of time, which adversely affected our sales and manufacturing performance, resulting in underabsorption of manufacturing overhead costs. In certain instances, despite the fact that we were not able to manufacture the product, we were able to obtain alternative sources, but at higher costs. In response to these quality systems and regulatory compliance issues, we made substantial capital and headcount investments during fiscal 2006. We increased our quality and regulatory assurance personnel at the affected facilities in an effort to address all of the FDAs concerns. We resumed sales for the majority of the affected Imaging Solutions products in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, and the detention was lifted on our temperature monitoring products. Sales of technetium generators within the Imaging Solutions segment were suspended, however, in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and we initiated a voluntary recall of such generators manufactured on or after February 23, 2007, as a result of a potential problem identified during routine testing of a production run. This issue was resolved before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007, and production of technetium generators resumed on April 2, 2007. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year 2008 2007 2006 Net sales $ 9,910 100.0 % $ 8,895 100.0 % $ 8,313 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 4,601 46.4 4,273 48.0 4,012 48.3 Gross profit 5,309 53.6 4,622 52.0 4,301 51.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,881 29.1 2,446 27.5 1,986 23.9 Research and development expenses 341 3.4 260 2.9 248 3.0 In process research and development charges 22 0.2 38 0.4 63 0.8 Restructuring charges 77 0.8 57 0.6 Class action and shareholder settlements, net of insurance recoveries 42 0.4 1,202 13.5 Intangible asset impairment charges 34 0.4 Gain on divestitures (48 ) (0.6 ) Operating income 1,946 19.6 585 6.6 2,052 24.7 Interest expense (209 ) (2.1 ) (188 ) (2.1 ) (171 ) (2.1 ) Interest income 43 0.4 35 0.4 32 0.4 Other income (expense), net 199 2.0 (135 ) (1.5 ) (13 ) (0.2 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,979 20.0 297 3.3 1,900 22.9 Income tax expense 536 5.4 462 5.2 470 5.7 Income (loss) from continuing operations 1,443 14.6 (165 ) (1.9 ) 1,430 17.2 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (82 ) (0.8 ) (177 ) (2.0 ) (275 ) (3.3 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,361 13.7 $ (342 ) (3.8 ) $ 1,155 13.9 Net sales Our net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $1.015 billion, or 11.4%, to $9.910 billion, compared with $8.895 billion in fiscal 2007. While revenue increased across all segments in fiscal 2008, the increase was primarily attributable to our Medical Devices segment. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $408 million to the increase in net sales for fiscal 2008. Our net sales in fiscal 2007 increased $582 million, or 7.0% to $8.895 billion, compared with $8.313 billion in fiscal 2006, with growth across all segments, except Medical Supplies. Currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $185 million to the increase in net sales. Net sales generated by our businesses in the United States were $5.435 billion, $5.109 billion and $4.897 billion in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our non U.S. businesses generated net sales of $4.475 billion, $3.786 billion and $3.416 billion in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our business outside the United States accounted for approximately 45%, 43% and 41% of our net sales for the fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 40 Table of Contents Net sales by geographic area for each of the last three fiscal years are shown in the following table (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 PercentageChange 2008 2007 United States $ 5,435 $ 5,109 $ 4,897 6.4 % 4.3 % Other Americas 577 480 433 20.2 10.9 Europe 2,750 2,320 2,046 18.5 13.4 Asia Pacific 1,148 986 937 16.4 5.2 $ 9,910 $ 8,895 $ 8,313 11.4 7.0 Costs of goods sold Cost of goods sold was 46.4% of net sales for fiscal 2008, compared with 48.0% of net sales for fiscal 2007. The decreases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which made products manufactured in the United States less expensive in most non U.S. markets. Cost of goods sold was 48.0% of net sales in fiscal 2007, compared with 48.3% of net sales in fiscal 2006. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2007 was attributable to favorable sales mix in our Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical Products segments, partially offset by higher raw material costs and incremental royalties associated with a legal settlement in our Medical Devices segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $435 million, or 17.8%, to $2.881 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with $2.446 billion in fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 29.1% of net sales for fiscal 2008, compared with 27.5% of net sales for fiscal 2007. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increases in selling and marketing expenses of $303 million, largely resulting from sales force investments made in our Medical Devices segment to support our growth initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $460 million, or 23.2%, to $2.446 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $1.986 billion in fiscal 2006. Selling and marketing expenses increased $186 million, primarily due to incremental headcount in the non U.S. salesforce within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, incremental domestic employee compensation costs contributed $67 million to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Further contributing to the increase were costs of approximately $53 million stemming from the separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses increased $81 million, or 31.2%, to $341 million in fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007. This increase resulted primarily from increased spending resulting from incremental headcount and new project spending in our Medical Devices segment and, to a lesser extent, increased spending in our Pharmaceutical Products segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 3.4% for fiscal 2008, compared with 2.9% for fiscal 2007. Research and development expenses increased $12 million, or 4.8%, to $260 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $248 million in fiscal 2006, despite the realization of savings associated with restructuring activity in our Medical Devices segment. As a percent of our net sales, research and development expenses decreased slightly to 2.9% in fiscal 2007 from 3.0% in fiscal 2006. In process research and development charges During fiscal 2008, our Medical Devices segment recorded a charge of $12 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of Scandius, a developer of medical devices for sports related surgeries. In addition to this charge, our Medical Devices and Imaging Solutions segments recorded in process research and development charges totaling $10 million in connection with two smaller acquisitions. 41 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges totaling $38 million for the write off of in process research and development, of which $30 million was associated with the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx. In addition, during fiscal 2007 our Medical Devices segment recorded an $8 million in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares of Airox. The above in process research and development charges related to the development of second generation technology that had not yet obtained regulatory approval. During fiscal 2006, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges totaling $63 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with acquisitions, $49 million of which related to the acquisition of Confluent. The $49 million in process research and development charge related to technology Confluent was developing for numerous applications across several surgical disciplines which had not yet received regulatory approval. As of the date of the Confluent acquisition, there were three projects under development at different stages of completion, none of which were considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. We determined the valuation of the in process research and development using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the projects and technologies involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion. The discount rates applied ranged from 20% to 23%, depending on the projects stage of completion and the type of FDA approval required. In addition, during fiscal 2006 our Medical Devices segment recorded an $11 million in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of 59% ownership of Airox and a $3 million in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of over 90% ownership of Floreane. In process research and development charges for the entire Airox acquisition totaled $19 million. More information regarding our in process research and development charges is provided under Critical Accounting Policies Business Combinations. Restructuring charges During fiscal 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $77 million, which is comprised of restructuring charges of $83 million, partially offset by changes in estimates of $6 million. The $83 million of restructuring charges includes asset impairment charges of $18 million primarily related to the write down of long lived assets of a manufacturing facility within our Medical Devices segment, which will be closed as a result of cost savings initiatives. The remaining charges and changes in estimates primarily relate to workforce reductions also within Medical Devices. During fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $57 million, which included asset impairment charges of $9 million for the write down of long lived assets at several manufacturing facilities within Medical Devices. The remaining $48 million primarily related to severance costs resulting from workforce reductions also within Medical Devices. Class action and shareholder settlements, net of insurance recoveries During fiscal 2008, Tyco International paid $36 million to the plaintiffs to settle the action captioned Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. This payment is subject to the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement discussed below. Accordingly, during the fiscal 2008, we recorded a charge of $15 million for the payment of our portion of this settlement to Tyco International. During fiscal 2008, Tyco International paid the State of New Jersey $73 million in exchange for the plaintiffs dismissal of the case against Tyco International and certain of its former directors and a former employee. In addition to the settlement charge discussed above, during fiscal 2008, we also recorded a charge of $31 million for the payment of our portion of this settlement in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. 42 Table of Contents In November 2008, Tyco International signed definitive agreements to settle the actions entitled Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. and Sciallo v. Tyco International., et al. These agreements call for Tyco International to make payments of $16 million and $2 million, respectively. These payments are also subject to the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Accordingly, we have recorded charges totaling $8 million in our fiscal 2008 statement of operations for the payment of our portion of these settlements to Tyco International. During fiscal 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits. Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration of the payment to the certified class of $2.975 billion plus accrued interest. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. During fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International. This amount was comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million. Because Covidien, Tyco International and Tyco Electronics were jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the settlement, at September 28, 2007, we had a $2.992 billion class action settlement liability for the full amount owed under the settlement, including accrued interest, and a $1.735 billion receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics for their portion of the liability. In fiscal 2007, we funded our portion of the payment into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability. Interest in class action settlement fund on our balance sheet at September 28, 2007, represented our $1.257 billion interest in Tyco Internationals funds held in escrow to settle the class action lawsuits. During fiscal 2008, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire entered a final order approving the class action settlement in accordance with the terms of the memorandum of understanding. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order approving the settlement expired in fiscal 2008. Accordingly, we removed the class action settlement liability and the related class action settlement receivable and interest in class action settlement fund from our balance sheet. While the finalization of the class action settlement resulted in a decrease to our cash flow from continuing operations during fiscal 2008, it did not affect our cash balance because we had previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as discussed above. During fiscal 2008, Tyco International received insurance recoveries related to its class action settlement totaling $38 million. Tyco International in turn paid us $16 million for our portion of the recoveries in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Intangible asset impairment charges In fiscal 2007, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $34 million, primarily related to the impairment of a non amortizable trademark associated with our Imaging Solutions segment. This impairment stemmed from a shift in branding strategy that resulted in discontinuing the use of the trademark. Gain on divestitures In fiscal 2006, we recorded a net gain on divestitures of $48 million, $45 million of which relates to the sale of our Radionics product line within our Medical Devices segment. Operating income In fiscal 2008, operating income was $1.946 billion, compared with $585 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income for fiscal 2008 included net shareholder settlement charges totaling $42 million, while operating income for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1.202 billion allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the Tyco International related class action settlement. The remaining $201 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher sales, increased gross profit, partially offset by increased selling and marketing expenses of $303 million and increased research and development expenses of $81 million. 43 Table of Contents In fiscal 2007, operating income was $585 million, compared with $2.052 billion in fiscal 2006. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1.202 billion allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recoveries. The remaining $265 million decrease in operating income was attributable an increase in selling and marketing expense of $186 million, primarily due to incremental headcount in the non U.S. salesforce within the Medical Devices segment, restructuring charges of $57 million, intangible asset impairment charges of $34 million and the absence of a gain on the divestiture of our Radionics product line of $45 million that was recorded in fiscal 2006. Further contributing to the decline in operating income were costs of approximately $53 million stemming from the separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. Higher sales, increased gross profit and a $25 million decrease in in process research and development charges partially offset the increase in operating expenses.

Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $361 million to the increase in net sales for the segment. Net sales for Endomechanical instruments in fiscal 2008 increased $280 million, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $127 million. The remaining increase in sales of Endomechanical products was primarily driven by continued demand for our laparoscopic instruments in the United States and Europe. Energy devices net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $167 million, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $41 million. The remaining increase in Energy devices net sales was primarily due to higher sales volume of vessel sealing products worldwide and, to a lesser extent, higher sales of capital equipment. Net sales of Soft Tissue Repair products increased $86 million, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $38 million. The remaining increase in Soft Tissue Repair products resulted from increased sales volume of mesh hernia repair products and, to a lesser extent, biosurgery products. Net sales in fiscal 2007 increased $438 million, or 7.8%, to $6,023 million, compared with fiscal 2006. Currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $159 million to the increase in net sales. Net sales increased across all product groups, particularly within Endomechanical Instruments, Energy Devices and Soft Tissue Repair Products. Endomechanical Instruments net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $131 million, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $60 million. Growth in Endomechanical Instruments was driven by continued demand for our Autosuture laparoscopic instruments in Europe and the United States. Energy Devices net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $105 million, primarily due to continued market growth of vessel sealing products, and to a lesser extent, new product launches in capital equipment and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations. Soft Tissue Repair Products net sales for fiscal 2007 increased $74 million, of which currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact of $19 million. The increase in Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily due to strong sales of biosurgery products in the United States. Operating income for fiscal 2008 increased $109 million, or 6.3%, to $1,828 million, compared with fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 27.0% for fiscal 2008, compared with 28.5% for fiscal 2007. The increase in our 45 Table of Contents operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance discussed above. This increase was partially offset by higher operating expenses, primarily an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $270 million, resulting principally from our sales force investment, growth initiatives and acquisitions. In addition, research and development expenses increased $61 million. Operating income decreased $93 million, or 5.1%, to $1,719 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $1,812 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 28.5% for fiscal 2007, compared with 32.4% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in our operating income and margin was attributable to an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $170 million primarily related to an increase in sales force headcount, restructuring charges of $54 million and the absence of a gain on the divestiture of the Radionics product line of $45 million recorded in fiscal 2006. Increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance discussed above and a decrease in in process research and development charges of $25 million partially offset the increase in operating expenses. Imaging Solutions Net sales for Imaging Solutions by groups of products and by geography for each of the last three fiscal years is as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 PercentageChange 2008 2007 Radiopharmaceuticals $ 559 $ 487 $ 432 14.8 % 12.7 % Contrast Products 655 590 562 11.0 % 5.0 % $ 1,214 $ 1,077 $ 994 12.7 % 8.4 % 2008 2007 2006 PercentageChange 2008 2007 U.S $ 718 $ 671 $ 633 7.0 % 6.0 % Non U.S. 496 406 361 22.2 % 12.5 % $ 1,214 $ 1,077 $ 994 12.7 % 8.4 % Net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $137 million, or 12.7%, to $1,214 million, compared with fiscal 2007. Radiopharmaceutical net sales increased $72 million, primarily due to higher sales volume, favorable pricing in the United States and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, contrast products net sales increased $65 million, resulting primarily from non U.S. sales volume and favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by pricing pressure in the United States. Currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $46 million to the increase in net sales for the segment. Imaging Solutions net sales increased $83 million, or 8.4%, to $1,077 million in fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $21 million to the net sales increase and was experienced across both product groups. Radiopharmaceuticals net sales increased $55 million due to higher sales volume of technetium generators that were under a voluntary recall during a portion of fiscal 2006 and higher sales volume from GPO contracts. Operating income of $104 million for fiscal 2008 was slightly higher than operating income of $100 million for fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 8.6% for fiscal 2008, compared with 9.3% for fiscal 2007. Increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance discussed above was largely offset by higher operating expenses, primarily attributable to increased legal costs of $26 million, the majority of which related to a $17 million legal settlement and higher selling and marketing expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the absence of a $33 million intangible asset impairment recorded in fiscal 2007. 46 Table of Contents Operating income for Imaging Solutions decreased $38 million, or 27.5%, to $100 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $138 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 9.3% for fiscal 2007, compared with 13.9% for fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the impairment of an indefinite lived trademark, which resulted in a $33 million charge. Pharmaceutical Products Net sales for Pharmaceutical Products by groups of products and by geography for each of the last three fiscal years is as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 PercentageChange 2008 2007 Dosage Pharmaceuticals $ 582 $ 468 $ 436 24.4 % 7.3 % Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 431 440 404 (2.0 )% 8.9 % $ 1,013 $ 908 $ 840 11.6 % 8.1 % 2008 2007 2006 PercentageChange 2008 2007 U.S $ 915 $ 829 $ 762 10.4 % 8.8 % Non U.S. 98 79 78 24.1 % 1.3 % $ 1,013 $ 908 $ 840 11.6 % 8.1 % Net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $105 million, or 11.6%, to $1,013 million, compared with fiscal 2007. Net sales increased $114 million in Dosage Pharmaceuticals driven by generic pharmaceutical and, to a lesser extent, branded pharmaceutical sales. The increase in generic pharmaceutical sales resulted primarily from a license agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, which allows us to sell limited quantities of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets for a limited period of time ending in 2009. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients sales decreased compared with fiscal 2007 as higher sales of peptide products were more than offset by lower sales of narcotic products. We expect sales for our Pharmaceutical Products segment to increase significantly in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of the license agreement previously discussed, which could contribute over $250 million in sales. Net sales increased $68 million, or 8.1%, to $908 million in fiscal 2007, compared with fiscal 2006. Net sales increased across both product groups. Net sales of Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients increased $36 million due to stronger demand for narcotic products and acetaminophen. Dosage Pharmaceuticals net sales increased $32 million, primarily due to higher sales volume of brand pharmaceuticals. Operating income for fiscal 2008 increased $48 million, or 16.9%, to $332 million, compared with fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 32.8% for fiscal 2008, compared with 31.3% for fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to favorable sales mix, partially offset by increased research and development expenses and higher selling expenses. We expect our operating income and margin to increase significantly in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of the license agreement discussed above. Operating income increased $25 million, or 9.7%, to $284 million in fiscal 2007, compared with $259 million in fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 31.3% for fiscal 2007, compared with 30.8% for fiscal 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales and gross profit due to favorable sales mix and plant performance resulting from cost reduction programs. 47 Table of Contents Medical Supplies Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for each of the last three fiscal years is as follows (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 2006 PercentageChange 2008 2007 Nursing Care Products $ 497 $ 477 $ 470 4.2 % 1.5 % Medical Surgical Products 276 275 275 0.4 % % Original Equipment Manufacturer Products 147 134 136 9.7 % (1.5 )% Other Products 1 13 (100.0 )% (92.3 )% $ 920 $ 887 $ 894 3.7 % (0.8 )% Net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $33 million, or 3.7%, to $920 million, compared with fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume of Nursing Care products, resulting largely from sales of new incontinent care products, and increased sales of Original Equipment Manufacturer products. Net sales for fiscal 2007 decreased $7 million to $887 million, compared with fiscal 2006. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to the impact of a product line divested in the prior year, partially offset by increased sales of Nursing Care Products, driven by pricing strategies in alternate site markets. Operating income of $140 million for fiscal 2008 was slightly lower than the $145 million for fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 15.2% for fiscal 2008, compared with 16.3% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to higher raw material and transportation costs. Operating income of $145 million for fiscal 2007 remained relatively level with operating income for fiscal 2006. Our operating margin was 16.3% for both fiscal 2007 and 2006. Strong plant cost reduction programs helped offset increasing raw material costs. Corporate Corporate expense was $458 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $1.663 billion for fiscal 2007. Corporate expense for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1.202 billion allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement, while corporate expense for fiscal 2008 included net shareholder settlement charges totaling $42 million. Insurance recoveries and a decrease in costs associated with branding the Covidien name contributed to the remaining decrease in corporate expense. Corporate expense was $1.663 billion in fiscal 2007, compared with $303 million for fiscal 2006. Corporate expense for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1.202 billion allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement and related insurance recoveries. The primary drivers of the remaining $158 million increase in Corporate expense consisted of $53 million of costs stemming from the separation associated with the expansion of our corporate infrastructure and the branding of the Covidien name. In addition, other general and administrative costs increased $72 million primarily driven by higher legal and environmental expenses and employee compensation costs. Non Operating Items Interest Expense and Interest Income During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest expense was $209 million, $188 million and $171 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $93 million and $144 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest income was $43 million, $35 million and $32 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $16 million and $20 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), net During fiscal 2008, other income, net was $199 million, compared to other expense, net of $135 million and $13 million in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other income, net in fiscal 2008 includes income of $214 million related to an increase in our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, $231 million ($0.46 for both basic and diluted earnings per share) of which reflects the indirect effect of adopting FIN 48 discussed in Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. There was also a corresponding increase to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Note 17 to our financial statements. In addition, other income net for fiscal 2008 includes income of $21 million related to an increase in our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, primarily interest. However, these amounts are partially offset by adjustments to certain pre separation tax contingencies and an audit settlement, which resulted in a $38 million decrease to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics and a corresponding charge to other expense. Other expense, net of $135 million for fiscal 2007 includes a $146 million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt allocated by Tyco International. This allocation was also based on the amount of Tyco Internationals debt that management believes we used historically. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $536 million, $462 million and $470 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.979 billion, $297 million and $1.900 billion for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 27.1%, 155.6% and 24.7% for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, was primarily due to charges incurred in fiscal 2007 related to the net class action settlement and allocated loss on early extinguishment of debt, for which no tax benefit was realized. In addition, the rate in fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by the settlement of certain income tax matters and adjustments to income tax liabilities pre dating the separation. These decreases in the fiscal 2008 tax rate were partially offset by increased interest costs incurred in connection with the adoption of FIN 48 discussed in Other Income (Expense), net, changes in certain non U.S. tax laws, and the expiration of the U.S. research and development tax credit as of December 31, 2007. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to charges related to the net class action settlement and loss on allocated early extinguishment of debt, for which no tax benefit was realized. In addition, the rate was adversely impacted by certain tax costs incurred in connection with our separation from Tyco International and other adjustments to legacy income tax liabilities. These increases were somewhat offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate due to a release in deferred tax valuation allowances related to changes in non U.S. tax law. Discontinued Operations Retail Products segment During fiscal 2008, we divested our Retail Products segment for gross cash proceeds of $330 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Deal costs and other adjustments resulted in net cash proceeds of $308 million, which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a $111 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to our Retail Products segment, which included charges totaling $75 million recorded during the first six months of fiscal 2008, to write down the business to its fair value less cost to sell. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on the sale agreement. The loss on sale of our Retail Products segment is expected to be adjusted in future reporting periods by a $4 million contingent payment due to Covidien. In addition, the Company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of a remaining Retail Products facility. However, the additional proceeds will likely be offset by incremental costs associated with selling the facility. During fiscal 2007, we performed an asset impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As a result of this impairment analysis we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $256 million associated with our former Retail Products segment, 49 Table of Contents which is included in loss on sale of discontinued operations. The estimated fair value of the Retail Products segment was evaluated based on discounted expected future cash flows of the related assets and reflects the adverse trends in raw material and energy costs, and a higher discount rate to represent current market conditions. As a result of this assessment, we determined that the book value of the Retail Products segment was in excess of its estimated fair value and, accordingly, recorded the impairment charge. European Incontinence business During fiscal 2008, we sold our European Incontinence business. As a condition of the sale, we were required to contribute cash of $43 million into the business prior to the closing of the transaction. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a $75 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to our European Incontinence business, which includes charges totaling $23 million recorded during the first six months of fiscal 2008, to write down the business to its fair value less costs to sell. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on the sale agreement. Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses During fiscal 2006, the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and the A&E Products business were sold for $975 million and $6 million in gross cash proceeds, respectively. Working capital and other adjustments resulted in net proceeds of $882 million for the sale of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses in fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2007, $30 million was collected from the purchaser of the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses pursuant to a post closing adjustment related to the decline in average resin prices. Net cash proceeds received for the sale of the A&E Products business were $2 million in fiscal 2006. Working capital adjustments of $6 million were agreed upon and collected in fiscal 2007. Both businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. During fiscal 2006, we recorded a $260 million and $26 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to the Plastics, Adhesives and Ludlow Coated Products businesses and A&E Products business, respectively, which include $275 million and $22 million, respectively, of pre tax impairment charges to write the businesses down to their fair values less costs to sell. Fair values used for the respective impairment assessments were based on existing market conditions and the terms and conditions included or expected to be included in the respective sale agreement. Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures and investments in businesses and technologies. Through the first quarter of fiscal 2007, as part of Tyco International, our cash was swept regularly by Tyco International at its discretion. Tyco International also funded our operating and investing activities as needed. Transfers of cash both to and from Tyco Internationals cash management system have been reflected as Net transfers to Tyco International Ltd. in our Combined Statements of Cash Flow. In fiscal 2007, subsequent to the separation, we received an $85 million true up payment from Tyco International to adjust for differences between our cash balance at June 29, 2007 and our final cash allocation in accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement. This amount is included in Net transfers to Tyco International Ltd. in our statement of cash flow for fiscal 2007. Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. The capital markets worldwide, including the United States, have been severely impacted by credit losses, asset write downs and failures of some financial institutions. This disruption has impacted credit spreads and pricing on new securities issuances. Our commercial paper program and credit facility are predominately with institutions that to date, appear to be relatively unaffected by the disruptions. We believe that our cash and other sources of liquidity, primarily our commercial paper program and committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and fund operations for the foreseeable future. 50 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $591 million was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the change in related party receivable on the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Other Income (Expense), net. An increase in accrued and other liabilities of $190 million, a significant portion of which relates to accrued interest, also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities. These amounts were partially offset by the finalization of Tyco Internationals class action settlement of $1.257 billion, an increase in inventories of $190 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $138 million. The finalization of the class action settlement did not affect our cash balance, however, as the funds had previously been set aside in an escrow account during fiscal 2007. The net cash provided by continuing investing activities of $996 million was primarily due to the release of our interest in Tyco Internationals class action settlement fund of $1.257 billion and net proceeds from the divestiture of our Retail Products segment and European Incontinence business totaling $263 million. These amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of $409 million and acquisition activity of $157 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of TSL and Scandius. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1.245 billion was primarily the result of the repayment of debt of $4.008 billion, primarily associated with borrowings under our bridge loan facility and dividend payments of $320 million. These payments were largely offset by the issuance of debt of $2.728 billion discussed in Capitalization below, net proceeds from commercial paper of $171 million and proceeds from option exercises of $157 million. Fiscal 2007 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.096 billion was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007, as adjusted for the net class action settlement charge, depreciation and amortization, loss on early extinguishment of debt, non cash compensation expenses and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $271 million, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.713 billion was primarily due to our interest in the class action settlement fund of $1.257 billion, capital expenditures of $356 million and acquisition activity of $117 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Airox for $47 million and the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx for $30 million. Acquisition activity also included $17 million of cash paid relating to holdback liabilities, primarily associated with the fiscal 2006 acquisition of Confluent. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. The net cash provided by continuing financing activities of $227 million was primarily the result of the issuance of external debt of $4.298 billion discussed in Capitalization below, partially offset by allocated debt activity of $2.291 billion, net transfers to Tyco International of $1.316 billion and the repayment of external debt of $525 million also discussed in Capitalization below. Fiscal 2006 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $1.296 billion was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006, as adjusted for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, purchased research and development and non cash compensation expense. This source of cash was partially offset by a $370 million decrease in accrued and other liabilities, driven by payments of $324 million for two patent infringement matters, a decrease in income taxes payable of $264 million and an increase in inventories of $160 million. 51 Table of Contents The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $751 million was primarily due to capital expenditures of $400 million and business acquisitions of $382 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $74 million from the sale of our Radionics product line. Cash paid for acquisitions consisted of: $200 million for the acquisition of Confluent; $123 million for the acquisition of over 90% ownership in Floreane and $59 million for the acquisition of 59% ownership of Airox. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $451 million was primarily the result of net transfers to Tyco International of $601 million and allocated debt activity of $548 million, partially offset by transfers from discontinued operations of $636 million, largely due to net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $7.747 billion, or $15.40 per share, at September 26, 2008, compared with $6.742 billion, or $13.55 per share, at September 28, 2007. This increase was primarily due to net income of $1.361 billion, partially offset by a decrease of $355 million resulting from the adoption of FIN 48 as discussed in Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and dividends of $320 million. At September 26, 2008, total debt was $3.005 billion, compared with total debt at September 28, 2007 of $4.088 billion. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 28% at September 26, 2008, compared with 38% at September 28, 2007. In October 2007, we completed a private placement of $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes, consisting of the following: $250 million of 5.2% notes due 2010; $500 million of 5.5% notes due 2012; $1.150 billion of 6.0% notes due 2017; and $850 million of 6.6% notes due 2037. We used the net proceeds of $2.727 billion to repay a portion of the borrowings under our $4.250 billion unsecured bridge loan facility. During fiscal 2008, we repaid the remaining $474 million outstanding under the unsecured bridge loan facility which matured in April 2008. During fiscal 2008, in accordance with the terms of the original issuance, we completed an exchange offering of the $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate unregistered senior notes described above for public notes. The form and terms of the public notes are identical in all material respects to the form and terms of the corresponding unregistered notes, except that the public notes do not bear legends restricting their transfer under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In February 2008, we initiated a commercial paper program. The notes issued under the commercial paper program are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Covidien Ltd. Proceeds from the sale of the notes are used for working capital and other corporate purposes. We are required to maintain an available unused balance under our $1.425 billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program. At September 26, 2008, we had $171 million of commercial paper outstanding. While we can still issue commercial paper, given the recent volatility in the financial markets, the maturity of commercial paper borrowings could be very short and the interest rates unfavorable to us. We have a $1.425 billion five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility expiring in 2012. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin dependent on our credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. We are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings. During fiscal 2008, we repaid the $724 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of September 28, 2007. Our revolving credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreement contains other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 52 Table of Contents Dividends Dividend payments were $320 million during fiscal 2008. On September 26, 2008, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record on October 9, 2008. This dividend, totaling $81 million, was paid on November 6, 2008. We expect that we will continue to pay comparable dividends to holders of our common shares. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Bermuda law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for external debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 26, 2008 is presented in the following table (dollars in millions). Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 5,347 $ 167 $ 167 $ 405 $ 325 $ 628 $ 3,655 Capital lease obligations(1) 83 22 7 7 6 6 35 Operating leases 351 88 61 48 37 29 88 Purchase obligations(2) 309 159 52 51 21 15 11 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,090 $ 436 $ 287 $ 511 $ 389 $ 678 $ 3,789 (1) Interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of September 26, 2008. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. The table above does not include $1.209 billion of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $347 million of associated accrued interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. In addition, other liabilities of $733 million, primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, insurable liabilities and deferred compensation, are excluded from this table because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be $27 million in fiscal 2009. In addition, we expect to make contributions of $11 million to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2009. At September 26, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $294 million. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. We believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material 53 Table of Contents adverse effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Item 3 Legal Proceedings and Note 19 to our financial statements provide further information regarding legal proceedings. Income Taxes Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. During 2007, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco Internationals, including our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agents Reports in May and June of 2007, which reflected the IRSs determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. Tyco International has appealed certain of the proposed tax adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion. It is our understanding that Tyco International intends to vigorously defend its previously filed tax return positions. In December 2007, the IRS commenced an examination of Tyco Internationals, including our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. In connection with the examination, Tyco International has submitted amendments to its U.S. federal income tax returns for the periods through 2004. We are currently in the process of adjusting our U.S. federal tax returns for the periods 2005 through 2007. These filings primarily reflect the impact of adjustments that have been agreed to with the IRS in prior examinations or have been reflected in prior U.S. federal income tax returns. The impact of these adjustments was to decrease non current income taxes payable by $53 million with corresponding adjustments to our non current deferred income taxes and long term receivable resulting from the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Note 17 to our financial statements. Such adjustments did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. We may be required to make additional adjustments resulting from examinations and further analysis of our historical filing positions. However, we do not believe any additional adjustments resulting from the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We may also be required to accrue and pay additional taxes for contingencies not related to us as a result of the Tax Sharing Agreement. We are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $1.398 billion of contingent tax liabilities which were recorded on the balance sheet at September 26, 2008. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not occur for several years. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we recorded a long term receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics of $585 million which is classified as due from former parent and affiliates on our balance sheet at September 26, 2008. This receivable primarily reflects 58% of the non current income taxes payable subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we would be liable for the entire amount of these liabilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities; we assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a 54 Table of Contents portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International using appraisals and liabilities amounting to $760 million related to these guarantees were recorded on our balance sheet, the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in shareholders equity. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the Agreements. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet, an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liabilities to the amount of such potential loss. This guarantee is not amortized because no predictable pattern of performance exists. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the Agreements, which may not occur for some years. In addition, as payments are made to indemnified parties, such payments are recorded as reductions to the liability and the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability. Following an analyses of the tax contingency reserves allocated to us and Tyco Electronics at the separation date, we adjusted our guaranteed tax liability to correct the initial amount recorded upon separation, based on the net reallocation of income tax reserves between the companies. This adjustment resulted in a $53 million decrease to our guaranteed tax liability in fiscal 2008. As of September 26, 2008, $707 million relating to these guarantees remained on our balance sheet. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. Note 19 to our financial statements provide further information with respect to these liabilities. We are liable for product performance, however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non U.S. jurisdictions. In certain circumstances, we enter into arrangements in which we provide multiple deliverables to our customers. Agreements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting. Total revenue is first allocated among the deliverables based upon their relative fair values. Revenue is then recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the principles described above. Fair values are determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties. We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in 55 Table of Contents accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in our reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our balance sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor specific trend analysis, contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2008 amounted to $2.357 billion. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first in, first out) or market value. We reduce the carrying value of inventory based on estimates of what is excess, slow moving and obsolete, as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These write downs are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If future market conditions and actual demands ultimately are less favorable than those projected, we would further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made. Subsequent changes in the estimates used to determine what is excess, slow moving or obsolete may result in an increase to earnings. Actual results historically have not differed materially from managements estimates. Property, Plant and Equipment Management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of property, plant and equipment relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. We assess the recoverability of assets using undiscounted cash flows. If an asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets fair value. The fair value is estimated based upon the present value of discounted future cash flows or other reasonable estimates of fair value. Fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment, there is a risk that the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment may be overstated or understated. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks and unpatented technology. We record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment which is discussed above. Business Combinations Amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. 56 Table of Contents Purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. We expense the value attributable to in process research and development projects at the time of acquisition. The valuation of in process research and development is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of in process research and development, we consider, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. Goodwill In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We utilize a two step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation, using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Contingencies We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 19 to our financial statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is known. Accordingly, we are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore we record the minimum amount, which could be zero. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. We record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. 57 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $29 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $4 million. Guarantees We have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to our financial statements and the maximum potential payments are not material. We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. See Off Balance Sheet Information Guarantees for more information. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including, the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain unless it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $6.617 billion and $443 million at September 26, 2008 and September 28, 2007, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Included in the valuation allowance at September 26, 2008 is approximately $6.027 billion which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non U.S. net operating losses recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling. It is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets in our balance sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income, including any future restructuring activities, may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation 58 Table of Contents allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. In accordance with FIN 48, we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the contingency. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability is established. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in income tax expense. We adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year. Finally, changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. However, management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements On September 29, 2007, we adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 was a $355 million reduction in accumulated earnings, a $197 million increase in deferred tax assets, primarily due to interest and state specific items, and a $642 million and $90 million increase in income taxes payable and receivable, respectively. In addition, we recorded an increase in amounts due from former parent and affiliates pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of $231 million as other income, representing the indirect effect of adoption. These amounts include both the impact of the initial adoption of FIN 48 recorded during the first quarter, as well as, the adjustments to the adoption of FIN 48 identified and recorded during the fourth quarter as discussed in Note 21 to our financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under SFAS No. 158 additional financial statement disclosures are also required. We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 at the end of fiscal 2007, and accordingly, recognized an after tax reduction of $51 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. In addition, under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end within two fiscal years after the initial adoption of the accounting standard. Currently, we use a measurement date of August 31st; however, we will transition to a measurement date that coincides with our fiscal year end in fiscal 2009. The adoption of the measurement date provision will result in a reduction to shareholders equity, the amount of which will not be significant. 59 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities, with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The enhanced disclosures set forth in SFAS No. 161 are effective for us in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) expands the definition of a business combination and requires acquisitions to be accounted for at fair value, including any interests retained by the seller. These fair value provisions will be applied to contingent consideration, in process research and development and acquisition contingencies. Purchase accounting adjustments will be reflected during the period in which an acquisition was originally recorded. Additionally, the new standard requires transaction costs and restructuring charges to be expensed. Finally, post acquisition changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for us for acquisitions closing during and subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits an entity, on a contract by contract basis, to make an irrevocable election to account for certain types of financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value, rather than at historical cost, with changes in the fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recognized in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We did not elect to use the fair value option on any qualifying items upon adoption. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for us in fiscal 2009, except with respect to certain non financial assets and liabilities, for which the effective date is fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS No. 157 will have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 60 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements. The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts. Foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use forward currency exchange contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing forward contracts outstanding at September 26, 2008, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 26, 2008 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of our forward contracts on our balance sheet by $86 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would increase the unrealized value of forward contracts on our balance sheet by $105 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. Interest rate risk primarily results from variable rate debt obligations. Based on a sensitivity analysis of the variable rate financial obligations in our debt portfolio as of September 26, 2008, a 25 basis point interest rate movement in the average market interest rates (either higher or lower) in fiscal 2009 would not have a significant impact on our financial statements, as our variable rate debt instruments represent only 6% of our total debt as of September 26, 2008. However, over time, we may seek to adjust the percentage of variable rate financial obligations in our debt portfolio through the use of swaps or other financial instruments. We are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in the production of our products and may enter into hedging contracts to manage those exposures. As of September 26, 2008, we had entered into derivative contracts for certain commodities. These contracts qualified for hedge accounting and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements. Concentration of Credit Risk We utilize established risk management policies and procedures in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. Although the instruments may not necessarily be designated as accounting hedges, we do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Counterparties 61 Table of Contents to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. There is no significant concentration of exposures with any counterparty. None of our derivative financial instruments outstanding at year end would result in a significant loss to us if a counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. At this time, we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments.
