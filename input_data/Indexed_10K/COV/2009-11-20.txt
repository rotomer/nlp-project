Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Overview Covidien Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd.; however, Covidien did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets until June 29, 2007. As part of a plan to separate Tyco International into three independent companies, Tyco International transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to Covidien and, on June 29, 2007, distributed all of its shares of Covidien to Tyco International shareholders. Our financial results reflect the consolidated operations of Covidien as an independent publicly traded company following June 29, 2007, and a combined reporting entity comprised of the assets and liabilities used in managing Tyco International Ltd.s healthcare businesses, including Covidien, prior to and including June 29, 2007. Our financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For the first nine months of fiscal 2007, prior to the separation, certain general corporate overhead, other expenses, debt and related net interest expense and loss on early extinguishment of debt have been allocated to us by Tyco International. Management believes such allocations are reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of the actual expenses we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly traded company. Note 17 to our financial statements provides additional information regarding allocated expenses. Recent Developments Reorganization In December 2008, our Board of Directors approved moving our principal executive office from Bermuda to Ireland. On May 28, 2009, shareholders voted in favor of a reorganization proposal pursuant to which all Covidien Ltd. common shares would be cancelled and all holders of such shares would receive ordinary shares of Covidien plc on a one to one basis. The reorganization transaction was completed on June 4, 2009, following approval from the Supreme Court of Bermuda, at which time Covidien plc replaced Covidien Ltd. as the ultimate parent company. Shares of the Irish company, Covidien plc, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, 2009 under the symbol COV, the same symbol under which Covidien Ltd. shares were previously traded. Change in Segment Reporting Structure During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we made a number of segment reporting changes to align external reporting with recent changes to our internal reporting structure. We combined our Pharmaceutical Products and Imaging Solutions segments into a single operating segment called Pharmaceuticals. Our pharmaceutical and imaging products businesses both face similar challenges including a lengthy product development cycle and extensive regulation by various agencies, such as the FDA. Integrating the management of these businesses further allows us to better utilize internal resources and achieve cost synergies. In addition, we reclassified our SharpSafety and Clinical Care product lines in the United States and Europe from our Medical Devices segment to our Medical Supplies segment, consistent with where management now responsible for their oversight are located. Subsequent to the acquisition of VNUS, we determined that the marketing strategies and sales call points associated with these products are better aligned with the businesses within our Medical Supplies segment. Finally, we reclassified several hernia mechanical devices from our Endomechanical Instruments product line to our Soft Tissue Repair product line, both within the Medical 35 Table of Contents Devices segment, and made several other less significant transfers between product lines and segments. Following these changes, we manage and operate our business through the following three segments: Medical Devices includes the development, manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments, soft tissue repair products, energy devices, oximetry and monitoring products, airway and ventilation products, vascular products and other medical products. Pharmaceuticals includes the development, manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, specialty chemicals, contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals. Medical Supplies includes the development, manufacture and sale of nursing care products, medical surgical products, SharpSafety products and original equipment manufacturer products (OEM). All periods have been restated for the changes to our segment reporting structure discussed above. Strategic Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements and Divestitures As part of our management of Covidien, we regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. We have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions as well as divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses. Acquisitions In November 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. (Aspect), a provider of brain monitoring technology, for approximately $210 million, net of cash and short term investments acquired. This purchase price included the assumption of approximately $60 million of debt. The acquisition of Aspect broadens our product offerings and adds a brain monitoring technology to our product portfolio. In September 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired Power Medical Interventions, Inc. (PMI), a provider of computer assisted, power actuated surgical cutting and stapling products, for approximately $65 million, including debt assumed of $25 million. The acquisition of PMI expanded our surgical stapling solutions. In June 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc. (VNUS), a developer of medical devices for minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux disease, for $473 million, net of cash acquired of $42 million. The acquisition of VNUS expanded our portfolio of vascular intervention products and our presence in the vascular market. During fiscal 2008, our Medical Devices segment acquired Tissue Science Laboratories plc (TSL), a medical device company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of tissue implant products for surgical and wound care therapies, for $74 million. The acquisition of TSL provided us with a leading tissue repair technology and accelerated our entry into the biologic hernia repair market. TSLs Permacol(R) product complemented our soft tissue product offerings and allowed us to offer a full line of differentiated hernia repair products. In November 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired Scandius Biomedical, Inc. (Scandius), a developer of medical devices for sports related surgeries, for $27 million. The acquisition of Scandius enabled us to offer customers innovative soft tissue repair devices for common sports injuries. In April 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired intellectual property from Sorbx, LLC (Sorbx), a developer of an absorbable tack technology used in hernia repair procedures, for $30 million. The acquisition of the intellectual property from Sorbx expanded our surgical devices portfolio. 36 Table of Contents Licensing Agreements In June 2009, our Pharmaceuticals segment entered into a licensing agreement with Nuvo Research Inc. (Nuvo). This licensing agreement grants us commercial rights to market and distribute Pennsaid Lotion and Pennsaid Gel, product candidates for the treatment of osteoarthritis. Pennsaid Lotion was approved by the FDA in November 2009, while Pennsaid Gel remains in development. This license arrangement included an up front cash payment of $10 million, which was included in research and development expenses. We are also responsible for all future development activities and expenses. In addition, we may be required to make additional payments up to $120 million based upon the successful completion of specified regulatory and sales milestones, as well as royalty payments on future sales of the products. In June 2009, our Pharmaceuticals segment entered into a licensing agreement with Neuromed Development Inc. (Neuromed), a subsidiary of Neuromed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. This licensing agreement grants us commercial rights to market and distribute in the United States EXALGO (hydromorphone HCL extended release), a pain management drug candidate, for an up front cash payment of $10 million, which was included in research and development expenses. Under the license arrangement, we are obligated to make additional payments up to $73 million based upon the successful completion of specified development and regulatory milestones. During fiscal 2009, $10 million of such milestone payments were made and included in research and development expenses. We will also contribute up to $16 million toward additional development costs incurred by Neuromed and pay royalties on any commercial sales of the developed product. Divestitures During fiscal 2009, we sold our Sleep Diagnostics product line within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Oxygen Therapy product line, also within our Medical Devices segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 includes charges totaling $21 million for the loss on sale of Sleep Diagnostics and the write down of Oxygen Therapy to its fair value less cost to sell based on the sale agreement. In September 2009, we also announced our plan to divest our Sleep Therapy product line within our Medical Devices segment. We plan to reallocate the resources previously used to support these product lines to our faster growing, higher margin businesses in which we have or can develop a global competitive advantage. During fiscal 2008, we sold our Retail Products segment and our European Incontinence Products business within our Medical Supplies segment because their products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. Both of these businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and, accordingly, have been included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations for further information. Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations Sales and Marketing Investment Selling and marketing expenses increased $305 million in fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing headcount and related compensation programs. The increase in headcount was to support our geographic expansion and increased focus on selling to and supporting customers directly rather than through distributors. Selling and marketing expenses in fiscal 2009 were level compared with fiscal 2008 as planned increases were offset by currency gains. In fiscal 2010, our focus will shift from investing in sales and marketing to leveraging the previous investments that we have made. Research and Development Investment Our research and development expense increased $83 million and $88 million in fiscal 2008 and 2009, respectively. The fiscal 2009 increase includes $37 million of incremental research and development expenses 37 Table of Contents incurred in connection with the Nuvo and Neuromed license arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. We expect research and development expenditures associated with internal initiatives, as well as licensing or acquiring technology from third parties, to increase as we continue to make incremental investments in research and development. We intend to focus our internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. We are committed to investing in pharmaceutical pain management products and products that have a demonstrable clinical impact and value to the healthcare system. Restructuring Initiatives During fiscal 2007, we launched a $150 million restructuring program, primarily in our Medical Devices and Medical Supplies segments. This program included numerous actions designed to improve our competitive position by exiting unprofitable product lines in low growth and declining growth markets, reducing excess machine capacity, moving production to lower cost alternatives through plant consolidations and outsourcing initiatives, and relocating certain functions to locations that enhance our recruiting, development and retention of personnel and lower operating costs. We expect the savings from these restructuring initiatives to partially offset the increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses necessary to support our growth initiatives. During fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $77 million and $57 million, respectively, as we consolidated certain facilities, primarily within the Medical Devices and Medical Supplies segments. During fiscal 2009, we launched another restructuring program also designed to improve our cost structure and to deliver improved operational growth. This program includes actions in all three segments, as well as at corporate. We expect to incur charges as these actions are undertaken of approximately $200 million under this program, most of which is expected to occur by the end of 2010. This program excludes acquisition related restructuring actions, which may be initiated in future periods. During fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $61 million under this program. Legal Settlements During fiscal 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits, pursuant to which Tyco International agreed to pay the certified class of $2.975 billion plus accrued interest. During fiscal 2007, in accordance with the sharing percentages included the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International, comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges totaling $58 million for our portion of Tyco Internationals settlements with certain shareholders and income of $16 million for our portion of insurance recoveries related to shareholder settlements. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $94 million related to three anti trust cases, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $183 million for our portion of Tyco Internationals settlements with certain shareholders and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining securities cases outstanding. 38 Table of Contents Currency Exchange Rates Our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2009 is as follows: U.S. Dollar 60 % Euro 18 Japanese Yen 7 All other 15 100 % Currency exchange rates also affect our cost of goods sold. To the extent other currencies depreciate against the U.S. dollar, transaction losses result on any products sourced from the United States in U.S. dollars which are then sold in non U.S. currencies. Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales: Fiscal Years (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 2007 Net sales $ 10,677 100.0 % $ 10,358 100.0 % $ 9,317 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 4,938 46.2 4,943 47.7 4,593 49.3 Gross profit 5,739 53.8 5,415 52.3 4,724 50.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,086 28.9 2,923 28.2 2,488 26.7 Research and development expenses 438 4.1 350 3.4 267 2.9 In process research and development charges 115 1.1 22 0.2 38 0.4 Restructuring charges 61 0.6 77 0.7 57 0.6 Class action and shareholder settlements, net of insurance recoveries 183 1.7 42 0.4 1,202 12.9 Intangible asset impairment charges 34 0.4 Operating income 1,856 17.4 2,001 19.3 638 6.8 Interest expense (175 ) (1.6 ) (209 ) (2.0 ) (188 ) (2.0 ) Interest income 25 0.2 44 0.4 36 0.4 Other income (expense), net 145 1.4 199 1.9 (135 ) (1.4 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,851 17.3 2,035 19.6 351 3.8 Income tax expense 949 8.9 498 4.8 485 5.2 Income (loss) from continuing operations 902 8.4 1,537 14.8 (134 ) (1.4 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 5 (176 ) (1.7 ) (208 ) (2.2 ) Net income (loss) $ 907 8.5 $ 1,361 13.1 $ (342 ) (3.7 ) Net sales Our net sales for fiscal 2009 increased $319 million, or 3.1%, to $10.677 billion, compared with $10.358 billion in fiscal 2008. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a $469 million decrease to net sales in fiscal 2009. The remaining increase in net sales was primarily driven by increased sales within our Medical Devices segment and $297 million of incremental sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets within our Pharmaceuticals segment. 39 Table of Contents Our net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $1.041 billion, or 11.2%, to $10.358 billion, compared with $9.317 billion in fiscal 2007. While revenue increased across all segments in fiscal 2008, the increase was primarily attributable to our Medical Devices segment. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $411 million to the increase in net sales for fiscal 2008. Net sales generated by our businesses in the United States were $6.170 billion, $5.713 billion and $5.400 billion in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our non U.S. businesses generated net sales of $4.507 billion, $4.645 billion and $3.917 billion in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our business outside the United States represents approximately 42%, 45% and 42% of our net sales for the fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in the proportion of non U.S. net sales in fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008 is attributable to the sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets in the United States and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Net sales by geographic area are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due toCurrency PercentageChange Due toOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 6,170 $ 5,713 8 % % 8 % Other Americas 560 586 (4 ) (17 ) 13 Europe 2,579 2,823 (9 ) (13 ) 4 Asia Pacific 1,368 1,236 11 11 $ 10,677 $ 10,358 3 (5 ) 8 Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due toCurrency PercentageChange Due toOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 U.S. $ 5,713 $ 5,400 6 % % 6 % Other Americas 586 490 20 10 10 Europe 2,823 2,385 18 12 6 Asia Pacific 1,236 1,042 19 8 11 $ 10,358 $ 9,317 11 4 7 Costs of goods sold Cost of goods sold was 46.2% of net sales for fiscal 2009, compared with 47.7% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The decrease in cost of products sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix in the Pharmaceuticals segment, resulting largely from sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets, which resulted in a decrease of 1.3 percentage points. Cost of goods sold was 47.7% of net sales for fiscal 2008, compared with 49.3% of net sales for fiscal 2007. The decreases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix and currency exchange rate fluctuations, which made products manufactured in the United States less expensive in most non U.S. markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $163 million, or 5.6%, to $3.086 billion in fiscal 2009, compared with $2.923 billion in fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 28.9% of net sales for fiscal 2009, compared with 28.2% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased legal and consulting costs, $94 million of which related to three anti trust cases, an increase in estimated environmental remediation costs of $82 million, primarily related to a site in Orrington, Maine, and planned growth in selling and marketing. These cost increases were partially offset by currency gains. 40 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $435 million, or 17.5%, to $2.923 billion in fiscal 2008, compared with $2.488 billion in fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 28.2% of net sales for fiscal 2008, compared with 26.7% of net sales for fiscal 2007. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increases in selling and marketing expenses of $305 million, largely resulting from sales force investments made in our Medical Devices segment to support our growth initiatives. Research and development expenses Research and development expense increased $88 million, or 25.1%, to $438 million in fiscal 2009, compared with $350 million in fiscal 2008. This increase resulted primarily from $37 million of incremental research and development expenses incurred in connection with the Nuvo and Neuromed license arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment and increased spending in our Medical Devices segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 4.1% for fiscal 2009, compared with 3.4% for fiscal 2008. Research and development expenses increased $83 million, or 31.1%, to $350 million in fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007. This increase resulted primarily from increased spending resulting from incremental headcount and new project spending in our Medical Devices segment and, to a lesser extent, increased spending in our Pharmaceuticals segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 3.4% for fiscal 2008, compared with 2.9% for fiscal 2007. In process research and development charges During fiscal 2009, our Medical Devices segment recorded a charge of $59 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of VNUS. The $59 million in process research and development charge is related to an alternative minimally invasive device for the treatment of varicose veins and venus reflux that VNUS is developing, which has not yet received regulatory approval. As of the date of acquisition, this technology was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. Design, testing, clinical trials and regulatory submission are required in order to bring the project to completion. If the device receives regulatory approval, we anticipate that it will occur in fiscal 2013 and be released to the market shortly thereafter. Management determined the valuation of the in process research and development using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method and was discounted at a 31% rate, which was considered commensurate with the projects risks and stage of development. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from the project were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the project and technology involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the project to completion. We can not assure that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will prove to be accurate or that the timely completion of the project to commercial success will occur. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties associated with research and development projects. In addition to this charge, during fiscal 2009, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges of $56 million for the write off of in process research and development, of which $36 million was associated with the acquisition of PMI and $20 million with the acquisition of intellectual property. During fiscal 2008, our Medical Devices segment recorded a charge of $12 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of Scandius. In addition to this charge, our Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals segments recorded in process research and development charges totaling $10 million in connection with two smaller acquisitions. These above in process research and development charges related to the development of second generation technology that had not yet obtained regulatory approval. During fiscal 2007, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges totaling $38 million for the write off of in process research and development, of which $30 million was associated with the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx. In addition, during fiscal 2007 our Medical Devices segment recorded an $8 million in process research and development charge associated with the acquisition of the remaining outstanding shares 41 Table of Contents of Airox. These in process research and development charges also related to the development of second generation technology that had not yet obtained regulatory approval. Restructuring charges During fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $61 million, comprised of restructuring charges of $66 million, partially offset by changes in estimates of $5 million. The $66 million of restructuring charges includes asset impairment charges of $12 million primarily related to the write down of long lived assets of a manufacturing facility within our Pharmaceutical segment, which will be closed as a result of cost savings initiatives. The remaining charges and changes in estimates primarily relate severance costs across all segments and corporate. During fiscal 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $77 million, which is comprised of restructuring charges of $83 million, partially offset by changes in estimates of $6 million. The $83 million of restructuring charges includes asset impairment charges of $18 million primarily related to the write down of long lived assets of a manufacturing facility within our Medical Devices segment, which has been closed as a result of cost savings initiatives. The remaining charges and changes in estimates primarily relate to workforce reductions also within Medical Devices. During fiscal 2007, we recorded restructuring charges of $57 million, which included asset impairment charges of $9 million for the write down of long lived assets at several manufacturing facilities primarily within Medical Supplies. The remaining $48 million primarily related to severance costs resulting from workforce reductions within both Medical Devices and Medical Supplies. Class action and shareholder settlements, net of insurance recoveries In March 2009, Tyco International reached agreements with the State of Colorado and Franklin Investment Advisors, pursuant to which Tyco International agreed to pay approximately $19 million and $42 million, respectively, to settle these cases. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $26 million for our portion of these settlements in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result of these and other recent settlements, the reserves for unresolved legacy Tyco International related securities matters were reassessed and the best estimate for probable loss was determined to be $375 million. During fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional charge of $157 million for our portion of the estimated cost to settle these unresolved matters in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. During fiscal 2009, Tyco International agreed to settle with five of the remaining plaintiffs that had opted out of the class action settlement and with plaintiffs who had brought Employee Retirement Income Security Act related claims for a total of $269 million. In accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, our share of these settlements is $113 million, which was within the range of loss previously provided. During fiscal 2008, Tyco International paid $109 million to settle two of the remaining cases. These payments were subject to the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Accordingly, during the fiscal 2008, we recorded a charge of $46 million for the payment of our portion of these settlements to Tyco International. In November 2008, Tyco International signed definitive agreements to settle three additional cases. These agreements called for Tyco International to make payments totaling $28 million. These payments were also subject to the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Accordingly, in fiscal 2008, we recorded an additional charge of $12 million for our portion of these settlements. During fiscal 2008, Tyco International received insurance recoveries totaling $38 million related to the class action settlement discussed below. Tyco International in turn paid us $16 million for our portion of the recoveries in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. During fiscal 2007, Tyco International entered into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs counsel in connection with the settlement of 32 securities class action lawsuits. Under the terms of the memorandum of 42 Table of Contents understanding, the plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against Tyco International, the other settling defendants and ten other individuals in consideration of the payment to the certified class of $2.975 billion plus accrued interest. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the companies share in the liability, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. During fiscal 2007, we were allocated a net charge of $1.202 billion from Tyco International. This amount was comprised of our portion of the class action settlement of $1.249 billion, net of our portion of the related insurance recoveries of $47 million. Intangible asset impairment charges In fiscal 2007, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $34 million, primarily related to the impairment of a non amortizable trademark associated with our Pharmaceuticals segment. This impairment stemmed from a shift in branding strategy that resulted in discontinuing the use of the trademark. Operating income In fiscal 2009, operating income decreased $145 million to $1.856 billion, compared with $2.001 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2009 was primarily due a $181 million increase in research and development expenditures resulting primarily from the acquisitions of VNUS and PMI and the Nuvo and Neuromed license arrangements, a $141 million increase in net shareholder settlements, increased legal costs, $94 million of which related to three anti trust cases, and an $82 million increase in estimated environmental remediation costs, primarily related to a site located in Orrington, Maine, partially offset by higher sales and increased gross profit. In fiscal 2008, operating income was $2.001 billion, compared with $638 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income for fiscal 2008 included net shareholder settlement charges totaling $42 million, while operating income for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1.202 billion allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the Tyco International related class action settlement. The remaining $203 million increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher sales and increased gross profit, partially offset by increased selling and marketing expenses of $305 million and increased research and development expenses of $83 million, both primarily within our Medical Devices segment.

Unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations of $317 million during fiscal 2009 were more than offset by increased sales volume of endomechanical instruments, energy devices, vascular products and soft tissue repair products. The increase in sales volume for Endomechanical Instruments was primarily driven by continued demand for our stapling devices and Autosuture laparoscopic instruments worldwide. The increase in operational sales for Energy Devices resulted primarily from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products worldwide, somewhat offset by a decrease in capital equipment sales in the United States. Vascular Products sales growth was primarily driven by increased sales of compression products in the United States and the acquisition of VNUS. The increase in sales volume for Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily due to hernia mesh products in the United States and, to a lesser extent, hernia mechanical devices. Operating income for fiscal 2009 decreased $56 million to $1.730 billion, compared with fiscal 2008. Our operating margin was 28.5% for fiscal 2009, compared with 30.2% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in our operating income was primarily attributable to a $97 million increase in in process research and development charges and a $54 million increase in research and development spending, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in restructuring charges and increased gross profit on favorable sales mix. 44 Table of Contents Net sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 Endomechanical Instruments $ 1,928 $ 1,698 14 % 7 % 7 % Soft Tissue Repair Products 786 642 22 7 15 Energy Devices 805 636 27 7 20 Oximetry & Monitoring Products 636 597 7 4 3 Airway & Ventilation Products 806 766 5 7 (2 ) Vascular Products 493 444 11 4 7 Other Products 460 430 7 8 (1 ) $ 5,914 $ 5,213 13 6 7 Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 U.S. $ 2,316 $ 2,172 7 % % 7 % Non U.S. 3,598 3,041 18 11 7 $ 5,914 $ 5,213 13 6 7 Net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $701 million, or 13%, to $5.914 billion, compared with fiscal 2007. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $332 million to the increase in net sales for the segment. The remaining increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in sales volume of energy devices, endomechanical instruments and soft tissue repair products. The increase in Energy Devices net sales was primarily due to higher sales volume of vessel sealing products worldwide and, to a lesser extent, higher sales of capital equipment. Endomechanical Instruments sales growth was primarily driven by continued demand for our stapling instruments in the United States and Europe. The increase in operational sales for Soft Tissue Repair Products resulted primarily from increased sales volume of soft tissue mechanical products and, to a lesser extent, mesh products. Operating income for fiscal 2008 increased $121 million, or 7%, to $1.786 billion, compared with fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 30.2% for fiscal 2008, compared with 31.9% for fiscal 2007. The increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance discussed above. This increase was partially offset by higher operating expenses, primarily an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $259 million, resulting principally from our sales force investment, growth initiatives and acquisitions. In addition, research and development expenses increased $51 million. Pharmaceuticals Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 Specialty Pharmaceuticals $ 898 $ 582 54 % % 54 % Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 405 431 (6 ) (7 ) 1 Specialty Chemicals 414 448 (8 ) (9 ) 1 Contrast Products 591 635 (7 ) (5 ) (2 ) Radiopharmaceuticals 556 559 (1 ) (4 ) 3 $ 2,864 $ 2,655 8 (4 ) 12 45 Table of Contents Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 2,108 $ 1,885 12 % % 12 % Non U.S. 756 770 (2 ) (16 ) 14 $ 2,864 $ 2,655 8 (4 ) 12 Net sales for fiscal 2009 increased $209 million, or 8%, to $2.864 billion, compared with fiscal 2008. Unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations of $121 million during fiscal 2009 were more than offset by increased sales volume of Specialty Pharmaceuticals resulting primarily from $297 million of incremental sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets under a license agreement which allowed us to sell limited quantities of such tablets for a limited period of time. We achieved the sales quantity of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets allowable under the agreement during the first six months of fiscal 2009; accordingly, there will be no further sales of such tablets. Operating income for fiscal 2009 increased $223 million to $703 million, compared with fiscal 2008. Our operating margin was 24.5% for fiscal 2009, compared with 18.1% for fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to the sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets discussed above. This increase in operating income was somewhat offset by increased research and development expenses primarily resulting from incremental expenses incurred in connection with the Nuvo and Neuromed licensing arrangements entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due To Currency PercentageChange Due To Operations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 Specialty Pharmaceuticals $ 582 $ 468 24 % % 24 % Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 431 440 (2 ) (2 ) Specialty Chemicals 448 422 6 1 5 Contrast Products 635 570 11 5 6 Radiopharmaceuticals 559 487 15 4 11 $ 2,655 $ 2,387 11 2 9 Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 U.S. $ 1,885 $ 1,757 7 % % 7 % Non U.S. 770 630 22 8 14 $ 2,655 $ 2,387 11 2 9 Net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $268 million, or 11%, to $2.655 billion, compared with fiscal 2007. Currency exchange rate fluctuations contributed $51 million to the increase in net sales for the segment. The remaining increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of specialty pharmaceuticals and, to a lesser extent, radiopharmaceuticals and contrast products. Increased sales volume of Specialty Pharmaceuticals resulted primarily from $57 million in sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets under the license agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and, to a lesser extent, increased sales of branded pharmaceutical. Sales growth in Radiopharmaceutical primarily resulted from higher sales volume and favorable pricing in the United States. In addition, operational sales for Contrast Products increased due to higher non U.S. sales volume, partially offset by pricing pressure in the United States. 46 Table of Contents Operating income for fiscal 2008 increased $53 million, or 12%, to $480 million, compared with fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 18.1% for fiscal 2008, compared with 17.9% for fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to favorable sales mix, partially offset by higher operating expense, primarily attributable to increased selling and marketing expenses, increased legal costs of $26 million, the majority of which related to a $17 million legal settlement and increased research and development spending. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the absence of a $33 million intangible asset impairment recorded in fiscal 2007. Medical Supplies Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 Nursing Care Products $ 790 $ 784 1 % (1 )% 2 % Medical Surgical Products 417 431 (3 ) (3 ) SharpSafety Products 334 362 (8 ) (1 ) (7 ) Original Equipment Manufacturer Products 211 212 $ 1,752 $ 1,789 (2 ) (2 ) Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 1,534 $ 1,512 1 % % 1 % Non U.S. 218 277 (21 ) (11 ) (10 ) $ 1,752 $ 1,789 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $37 million, or 2%, to $1.752 billion, compared with fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of $31 million and a decline in sales of needles and syringes within SharpSafety primarily resulting from our decision to exit this business in Europe. These decreases in net sales were partially offset by an increase in incontinence sales within Nursing Care Products resulting primarily from new products, particularly quilted and bariatric briefs. Operating income for fiscal 2009 increased $18 million to $211 million, compared with fiscal 2008. Our operating margin was 12.0% for fiscal 2009, compared with 10.8% for fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in research and development expense and lower selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to savings resulting from restructuring actions. Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 Nursing Care Products $ 784 $ 745 5 % 1 % 4 % Medical Surgical Products 431 415 4 3 1 SharpSafety Products 362 359 1 1 Original Equipment Manufacturer Products 212 198 7 7 $ 1,789 $ 1,717 4 1 3 47 Table of Contents Fiscal Years PercentageChange PercentageChange Due ToCurrency PercentageChange Due ToOperations (Dollars in Millions) 2008 2007 U.S. $ 1,512 $ 1,471 3 % % 3 % Non U.S. 277 246 13 12 1 $ 1,789 $ 1,717 4 1 3 Net sales for fiscal 2008 increased $72 million, or 4%, to $1.789 billion, compared with fiscal 2007. This increase was primarily due to currency exchange rate fluctuations of $28 million and higher sales volume of Nursing Care products, resulting largely from sales of new incontinent care products. The increase in operational sales was also due to increased sales of Original Equipment Manufacturer products. Operating income for fiscal 2008 decreased $16 million, or 8% to $193 million, compared with fiscal 2007. Our operating margin was 10.8% for fiscal 2008, compared with 12.2% for fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to higher raw material and transportation costs. Corporate Corporate expense was $788 million for fiscal 2009, compared to $458 million for fiscal 2008. The increase for fiscal 2009, compared with the same prior year period, was primarily due to $141 million of incremental shareholder settlement charges for our portion of Tyco Internationals legal settlements with certain shareholders and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining securities cases outstanding, increased legal costs, $94 million of which related to the settlement of three anti trust cases, and increased estimated environmental remediation costs of $78 million, primarily related to a site in Orrington, Maine. Corporate expense was $458 million for fiscal 2008, compared with $1.663 billion for fiscal 2007. Corporate expense for fiscal 2007 included a net charge of $1.202 billion allocated to us by Tyco International for our portion of the class action settlement, while corporate expense for fiscal 2008 included net shareholder settlement charges totaling $42 million. Insurance recoveries and a decrease in costs associated with branding the Covidien name contributed to the remaining decrease in corporate expense. Non Operating Items Interest Expense and Interest Income During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest expense was $175 million, $209 million and $188 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $93 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008, resulted from a decrease in our average outstanding debt balances, while the increase in interest expense for fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, resulted from an increase in our average outstanding debt balances. Net interest expense was proportionately allocated to us by Tyco International through June 1, 2007, based on our historical funding requirements using Tyco Internationals historical weighted average interest rate on its debt. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest income was $25 million, $44 million and $36 million, respectively, of which Tyco International allocated to us $16 million in fiscal 2007. Other Income (Expense), net Other income, net of $145 million for fiscal 2009 includes income of $148 million and a corresponding increase to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, which reflects 58% of interest and other income tax payable amounts recorded during fiscal 2009 that will be covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The $148 million includes income of $107 million which represents the effect of Tyco Internationals settlement of certain outstanding tax matters with the IRS on our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. 48 Table of Contents Other income, net of $199 million for fiscal 2008 includes income of $214 million and a corresponding increase to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. The $214 million includes $231 million ($0.46 for both basic and diluted earnings per share) which represents the indirect effect of changes to our accounting for uncertain income tax positions discussed in Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. Other income, net for fiscal 2008 also includes income of $21 million related to an increase in our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, primarily related to interest. These amounts are partially offset by adjustments to certain pre separation tax contingencies and an audit settlement, which resulted in a $38 million decrease to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics and a corresponding charge to other expense. Other expense, net of $135 million for fiscal 2007 includes a $146 million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt allocated by Tyco International. This allocation was based on the amount of Tyco Internationals debt that management believes we used historically. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $949 million, $498 million and $485 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.851 billion, $2.035 billion and $351 million for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 51.3%, 24.5% and 138.2% for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008, resulted from the effect of Tyco Internationals settlement with the IRS of certain outstanding tax matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle and withholding tax incurred on repatriated earnings. We, together with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics have significant potential tax liabilities related to periods prior to the separation from Tyco International. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The timing, nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. In September 2009, Tyco International agreed to a negotiated settlement of certain matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle, although the cycle remains open and subject to examination and resolution. This settlement, which includes interest, will result in a payment by us of approximately $205 million to the IRS, offset by a receivable of $107 million from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics under the Tax Sharing Agreement. This settlement should not be considered an indication of the likely outcome of any other tax contingency identified by the Company. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we provided for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and a 5% withholding tax in the amount of $167 million on earnings that were repatriated in connection with the implementation of our tax planning strategies. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was also due to the write off of a previously recognized $60 million deferred tax asset related to our Specialty Chemicals business and $141 million of incremental net shareholder settlement charges and $93 million of incremental in process research and development charges, for which no tax benefit was recorded. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008, compared with fiscal 2007, was primarily due to charges incurred in fiscal 2007 related to the net class action settlement and allocated loss on early extinguishment of debt, for which no tax benefit was realized. In addition, the rate in fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by the settlement of certain income tax matters and adjustments to income tax liabilities pre dating the separation. These decreases in the fiscal 2008 tax rate were partially offset by increased interest costs incurred in connection with the adoption of the provisions that clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes discussed in Other Income (Expense), net, changes in certain non U.S. tax laws and the expiration of the U.S. research and development tax credit as of December 31, 2007. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2008, we sold our Retail Products segment and our European Incontinence Products business within the Medical Supplies segment because their products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. 49 Table of Contents Retail Products segment During fiscal 2008, we sold our Retail Products segment for gross cash proceeds of $330 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Deal costs and other adjustments resulted in net cash proceeds of $308 million, which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a $111 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to our Retail Products segment, which included charges totaling $75 million recorded during the first six months of fiscal 2008, to write down the business to its fair value less cost to sell. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on the sale agreement. The loss on sale was adjusted in fiscal 2009 because of the receipt of contingent payments and net proceeds from the sale of a Retail Products facility totaling $12 million. During fiscal 2007, we performed an asset impairment analysis and determined that the book value of the Retail Products segment was in excess of its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $256 million associated with our former Retail Products segment, which is included in loss on sale of discontinued operations. The estimated fair value of the Retail Products segment was evaluated based on discounted expected future cash flows of the related assets and reflected the adverse trends in raw material and energy costs, and a higher discount rate to represent market conditions existing at the time. European Incontinence business During fiscal 2008, we also sold our European Incontinence business. As a condition of the sale, we were required to contribute cash of $43 million into the business prior to the closing of the transaction. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a $75 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations related to our European Incontinence business, which includes charges totaling $23 million recorded during the first six months of fiscal 2008, to write down the business to its fair value less costs to sell. Fair value used for the impairment assessment was based on the sale agreement. Change in Plan of Sale During fiscal 2008, we decided to sell our Specialty Chemical business within the Pharmaceuticals segment because its products and customer base were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. The Specialty Chemicals business had been classified as held for sale and the results of its activities reflected within discontinued operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we ceased efforts to market this business given market conditions existing at the time. As a result, the Specialty Chemicals business no longer met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and, accordingly, was reclassified from held for sale to held and used and from discontinued operations to continuing operations for all periods presented. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded $18 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense relating to the period from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal 2009 when the Specialty Chemicals business was classified as held for sale. In addition, as discussed under Income Tax Expense we recorded a charge of $60 million for the write off of a previously recognized deferred tax asset resulting from the reclassification of this business to continuing operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. We believe, however, that our cash balances and other sources of liquidity, primarily our committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Fiscal 2009 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $1.875 billion was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2009, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, the change in related party receivable on the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Other Income (Expense), net, in process research and development charges and an increase in working capital of $401 million driven primarily by accrued and other liabilities and income taxes payable. The increase in accrued and other liabilities includes $72 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs and $58 million relating to an anti trust legal settlement. A majority of the 50 Table of Contents increase in income taxes relates to our portion of Tyco Internationals settlement with the IRS of certain outstanding tax matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle. During fiscal 2009, we paid $151 million for our portion of Tyco Internationals settlements with certain shareholders. In addition, we paid $129 million for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and withholding tax on earnings that were either repatriated or undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in certain subsidiaries. The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.027 billion was primarily due to acquisition related payments of $608 million, primarily associated with the acquisition of VNUS, and capital expenditures of $412 million. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $575 million was primarily the result of dividend payments of $322 million and repurchases of shares totaling $232 million discussed under Share Repurchases. Fiscal 2008 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $633 million was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the change in related party receivable on the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Other Income (Expense), net. An increase in accrued and other liabilities of $189 million, a significant portion of which relates to accrued interest, also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities. These amounts were partially offset by the finalization of Tyco Internationals class action settlement of $1.257 billion, an increase in inventories of $199 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $134 million. The finalization of the class action settlement did not affect our cash balance, however, as the funds had previously been set aside in an escrow account during fiscal 2007. The net cash provided by continuing investing activities of $974 million was primarily due to the release of our interest in Tyco Internationals class action settlement fund of $1.257 billion and $263 million in net proceeds from the divestitures, primarily related to our Retail Products segment and European Incontinence business. These amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of $429 million and acquisition activity of $157 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of TSL and Scandius. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1.283 billion was primarily the result of the repayment of debt of $4.007 billion, primarily associated with borrowings under our bridge loan facility and dividend payments of $320 million. These payments were largely offset by the issuance of debt of $2.727 billion, net proceeds from commercial paper of $171 million and proceeds from option exercises of $157 million. Fiscal 2007 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $2.133 billion was primarily attributable to loss from continuing operations for fiscal 2007, as adjusted for the net class action settlement charge, depreciation and amortization, loss on early extinguishment of debt and an increase in accrued and other liabilities of $269 million, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation. The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.725 billion was primarily due to our interest in the class action settlement fund of $1.257 billion, capital expenditures of $369 million and acquisition activity of $117 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Airox for $47 million and the acquisition of intellectual property from Sorbx for $30 million. Acquisition activity also included $17 million of cash paid relating to holdback liabilities, primarily associated with the fiscal 2006 acquisition of Confluent. Holdback liabilities represent a portion of the purchase price that is withheld from the seller pending finalization of the acquisition balance sheet and other contingencies. The net cash provided by continuing financing activities of $145 million was primarily the result of the issuance of external debt of $4.298 billion, partially offset by allocated debt activity of $2.291 billion, net transfer to Tyco International of $1.316 billion and the repayment of external debt of $525 million. 51 Table of Contents Capitalization Shareholders equity was $8.001 billion, or $16.03 per share, at September 25, 2009, compared with $7.747 billion, or $15.40 per share, at September 26, 2008. Net income of $907 million was largely offset by dividends declared of $332 million, the repurchase of shares of $232 million and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $125 million. At September 25, 2009, total debt was $2.991 billion and cash was $1.467 billion, compared with total debt of $3.005 billion and cash of $1.208 billion at September 26, 2008. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 27% at September 25, 2009, compared with 28% at September 26, 2008. We are required to maintain an available unused balance under our $1.425 billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. At September 25, 2009, we had $151 million of commercial paper outstanding and no amount outstanding under the credit facility. Our credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreement contains other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Dividends Dividend payments were $322 million during fiscal 2009. On September 24, 2009, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 per share to $0.18 per share. The dividend declared of $0.18 per share to shareholders of record on October 6, 2009, totaling $87 million, was paid on November 6, 2009. We expect that we will continue to pay dividends comparable to this increased amount to holders of our ordinary shares. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Share Repurchases During fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to $300 million of our ordinary shares to partially offset dilution related to equity compensation plans. Shares may be repurchased from time to time, based on market conditions. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 6 million ordinary shares for $225 million under this program. We also repurchase shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. In addition, we repurchase shares to settle certain option exercises. During fiscal 2009, an additional $7 million was spent to acquire shares in connection with such share based awards. In fiscal 2009, prior to the reorganization discussed under Recent Developments, we retired the 2.1 million shares that Covidien Ltd. held in treasury. 52 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for external debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 25, 2009 is presented in the following table. (Dollars in Millions) Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 5,263 $ 193 $ 411 $ 305 $ 640 $ 132 $ 3,582 Capital lease obligations(1) 61 7 7 6 6 6 29 Operating leases 373 97 66 50 39 35 86 Purchase obligations(2) 194 108 31 26 14 15 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 369 9 360 Total contractual cash obligations(4) $ 6,260 $ 414 $ 875 $ 387 $ 699 $ 188 $ 3,697 (1) Interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of September 25, 2009. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. (3) The table above does not include $1.051 billion of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $424 million of associated accrued interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. (4) This table does not include other liabilities of $970 million, primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, insurable liabilities and deferred compensation, because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be $41 million in fiscal 2010. In addition, we expect to make contributions of $11 million to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2010. At September 25, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $362 million. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. We believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Item 3 Legal Proceedings and note 19 to our financial statements provide further information regarding legal proceedings. Income Taxes In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of legacy Tyco International, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. We are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $1.774 billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet at September 25, 2009, $1.220 billion of which relates to periods prior to the separation and is shared with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics pursuant to 53 Table of Contents the Tax Sharing Agreement. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, which may not occur for several years. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we have recorded a long term receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics of $708 million, which is classified as due from former parent and affiliates on our balance sheet at September 25, 2009. This receivable primarily reflects 58% of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities. Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. Open periods for examination include certain periods during which we were a subsidiary of Tyco International. The resolution of these matters is subject to the conditions set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement. Tyco International has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to the separation. We have significant potential tax liabilities related to these periods and have included our best estimate of the amounts which relate to our operations within our non current income taxes payable. The IRS has concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco Internationals U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. Tyco International has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the IRS which affect all three of the companies and total approximately $1 billion. We believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements related to these matters are adequate. In addition, in September 2009, Tyco International and the IRS entered into settlements related to certain outstanding tax matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle, which cycle remains open and subject to examination and resolution of other matters. The net effect of the settlements will require us to make a payment of approximately $205 million to the IRS, potentially in fiscal 2011, which is included in non current income taxes payable on the balance sheet. However, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we will receive payments totaling approximately $107 million from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, which is included in due from former parent and affiliates. The impacts of these settlements are reflected in income tax expense and other income, respectively. We will also be required to reimburse Tyco International and Tyco Electronics an insignificant amount for our portion of their settlements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities; we assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International using appraisals and liabilities related to these guarantees were recorded on our balance sheet, the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in shareholders equity. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the Agreements. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet, an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liabilities to the amount of such potential loss. This guarantee is not amortized because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the Agreements, which may not occur for some years. In addition, as payments are made to indemnified parties, such payments are recorded as 54 Table of Contents reductions to the liability and the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability. During fiscal 2009, following analyses of the tax contingency reserves allocated to us and Tyco Electronics at the separation date, we increased our guaranteed tax liability by $11 million. A liability of $718 million and $707 million relating to these guarantees was included on our balance sheet at September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities, which are discussed in note 19 to our financial statements. In addition, we are liable for product performance, however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non U.S. jurisdictions. In certain circumstances, we enter into arrangements in which we provide multiple deliverables to our customers. Agreements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting. Total revenue is first allocated among the deliverables based upon their relative fair values. Revenue is then recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the principles described above. Fair values are determined based on sales of the individual deliverables to other third parties. We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our balance sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analyses. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2009 amounted to $2.873 billion. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost (primarily first in, first out) or market value. We reduce the carrying value of inventory based on estimates of what is excess, slow moving and obsolete, as well 55 Table of Contents as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value. These write downs are based on current assessments about future demands, market conditions and related management initiatives. If future market conditions and actual demands ultimately are less favorable than those projected, we would further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made. Subsequent changes in the estimates used to determine what is excess, slow moving or obsolete may result in an increase to earnings. Actual results historically have not differed materially from managements estimates. Property, Plant and Equipment Management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of property, plant and equipment relying on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment are present, the carrying values of the assets are evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying business. We assess the recoverability of assets using undiscounted cash flows. If an asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the assets fair value. The fair value is estimated based upon the present value of discounted future cash flows or other reasonable estimates of fair value. Fair values are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment, there is a risk that the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment may be overstated or understated. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks, unpatented technology and customer lists. We record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years. Amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment in the same manner as goodwill. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment discussed above. Business Combinations We allocate amounts paid for acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval. We currently expense the value attributable to in process research and development projects at the time of acquisition; however as discussed in Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, beginning in fiscal 2010, such amounts will be capitalized as an indefinite lived asset. The valuation of in process research and development is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the value of in process research and development, we consider, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used is determined at the time of 56 Table of Contents acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized. Goodwill In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We utilize a two step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation, using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Contingencies We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in note 19 to our financial statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is available. Accordingly, we are often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, and therefore we record the minimum amount, which could be zero. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected. We record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on the market rate for a broad population of Moodys AA rated corporate bonds over $250 million. For our non U.S. plans, the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates. A decrease in the discount 57 Table of Contents rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $54 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. See Off Balance Sheet Information Guarantees for more information. In addition, we have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to our financial statements and the maximum potential payments are not material. We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $6.492 billion and $6.617 billion at September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Included in the valuation allowance at both September 25, 2009 and September 26, 2008 is approximately $6.0 billion which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non U.S. net operating losses recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling. It is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets in our balance sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income, including any future restructuring activities, may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the contingency. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability is established. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in income tax expense. We adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate 58 Table of Contents resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. Substantially all of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes, however, which would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued enhanced disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The additional disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The required disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities are presented in note 12 to our financial statements. Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, which requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Additional financial statement disclosures are also required. We adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions at the end of fiscal 2007, and accordingly, recognized an after tax reduction of $51 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. In addition, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We previously used a measurement date of August 31st; however, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we transitioned to a measurement date that coincides with our fiscal year end. The adoption of the measurement date provision resulted in a reduction to shareholders equity to reflect the incremental one month charge from August to September. Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions In June 2006, the FASB issued authoritative literature, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements. This literature prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. On September 29, 2007, we adopted these provisions. The cumulative effect of adopting these provisions was a $355 million reduction in retained earnings, a $197 million increase in deferred tax assets, primarily due to interest and state specific items, and a $642 million and $90 million increase in income taxes payable and receivable, respectively. In addition, we recorded an increase in amounts due from former parent and affiliates pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement of $231 million as other income, representing the indirect effect of adoption. Notes 5 and 17 to our financial statements provide additional information regarding income taxes and the Tax Sharing Agreement, respectively. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets In December 2008, the FASB issued enhanced disclosure requirements for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. The additional disclosures are intended to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (a) how investment allocation decisions are made, (b) the major categories of plan assets, (c) the inputs and valuation 59 Table of Contents techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, (d) the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period and (e) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. We are required to comply with these disclosure requirements beginning in fiscal 2010. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative literature on business combinations, which expands the definition of a business combination and changes the manner in which we account for business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010. Significant changes include the capitalization of in process research and development as an indefinite lived asset, the recognition of certain acquired contingent assets and liabilities at fair value, the expensing of acquisition related restructuring actions and transaction costs, and the recognition of contingent purchase price consideration at fair value on the acquisition date. In addition, post acquisition changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties will be recognized as income tax expense or benefit. The accounting treatment for taxes will be applicable to acquisitions that close both prior and subsequent to the adoption of this pronouncement. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements. The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts. Foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts outstanding at September 25, 2009, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 25, 2009 market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by $50 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by $30 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. 60 Table of Contents Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments. We invest our excess cash in deposits or money market funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions that have at least an A credit rating. We provide credit and do not generally require collateral; however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. Counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. While we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments, we minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions and actively monitoring outstanding positions.
