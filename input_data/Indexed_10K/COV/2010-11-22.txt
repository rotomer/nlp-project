Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Overview We develop, manufacture and sell healthcare products for use in clinical and home settings. Our mission is to create and deliver innovative healthcare solutions, developed in ethical collaboration with medical professionals, which enhance the quality of life for patients and improve outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. We manage and operate our business through the following three segments: Medical Devices includes the development, manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments, soft tissue repair products, energy devices, oximetry and monitoring products, airway and ventilation products, products used in vascular therapies and other medical products. Pharmaceuticals includes the development, manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals. Medical Supplies includes the development, manufacture and sale of nursing care products, medical surgical products, SharpSafety products and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products. Effective June 29, 2007, Covidien became the parent company owning the former healthcare businesses of Tyco International Ltd. As part of a plan to separate Tyco International into three independent companies, Tyco International transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to Covidien and, on June 29, 2007, distributed all of its shares of Covidien and Tyco Electronics to Tyco International shareholders (the separation). Our financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Recent Development In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act was enacted in the United States, which includes provisions that would impose a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain of our medical device and supply products in the United States starting in 2013. In addition, the new legislation includes a $28 billion fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry over nine years starting in 2011 and a $2.8 billion annual fee on branded pharmaceuticals thereafter. The amount of branded pharmaceutical fee payable by each company is based upon market share. Since our branded pharmaceutical sales currently represent a small portion of the total market, we do not expect this annual assessment to have a significant impact on Covidien. The medical devices tax, however, may have a significant impact on our results of operations. We are still evaluating the potential impact that this tax may have on our overall business. This new legislation increases our cost of doing business. If this cost is not offset by increased demand for our products, other cost reductions or price increases, we could experience lower margins and profitability and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition to the excise tax and annual fee described above, the new legislation contains numerous other provisions, many of which pertain to health insurance plans, which could impact our financial results in future periods. 2010 Form 10 K 32 Table of Contents Strategic Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements and Divestitures We regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. We have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions, as well as divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses. Acquisitions In July 2010, our Medical Devices segment acquired ev3 Inc., a developer of technologies for the endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular and neurovascular diseases, for cash of approximately $2.5 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of ev3 expands our vascular intervention product offerings and presence in the vascular market. In addition, in July 2010, our Medical Devices segment acquired Somanetics Corporation, a developer of cerebral and somatic oximetry and monitoring systems, for cash of $291 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of Somanetics broadens our oximetry and monitoring product portfolio and our presence in the operating room. In November 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. (Aspect), a provider of brain monitoring technology, for cash of $150 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, we assumed $58 million of debt in the transaction, which we subsequently repaid. The acquisition of Aspect broadens our product offerings and adds a brain monitoring technology to our product portfolio. In September 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired Power Medical Interventions, Inc. (PMI), a provider of computer assisted, power actuated surgical cutting and stapling products, for cash of $40 million. In addition, we assumed $25 million of debt in the transaction. The acquisition of PMI expanded our surgical stapling solutions. In June 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc. (VNUS), a developer of medical devices for minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux disease, for cash of $476 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of VNUS expanded our portfolio of vascular intervention products and our presence in the vascular market. During fiscal 2008, our Medical Devices segment acquired Tissue Science Laboratories plc (TSL), a medical device company dedicated to the research, development and commercialization of tissue implant products for surgical and wound care therapies, for cash of $74 million. The acquisition of TSL provided us with a leading tissue repair technology and accelerated our entry into the biologic hernia repair market. TSLs Permacol product complemented our soft tissue product offerings and allowed us to offer a full line of differentiated hernia repair products. In November 2007, our Medical Devices segment acquired Scandius Biomedical, Inc. (Scandius), a developer of medical devices for sports related surgeries, for cash of $27 million. The acquisition of Scandius enabled us to offer customers innovative soft tissue repair devices for common sports injuries. Licensing Agreements To expand our entry into the branded pain management market, in June 2009, our Pharmaceuticals segment entered into a licensing agreement which granted us rights to market and distribute PENNSAID&reg; topical solution and PENNSAID&reg; gel, topical pain management product candidates for the treatment of osteoarthritis. This license arrangement included an up front cash payment of $10 million, which was included in research and development expenses during fiscal 2009. We are also responsible for all future development activities and 33 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents expenses. In addition, we may be required to make additional payments up to $120 million based upon the successful completion of specified regulatory and sales milestones, and are required to pay royalties on sales of the products. During fiscal 2010, upon FDA approval of PENNSAID&reg; topical solution, we made a milestone payment of $15 million, which was capitalized as an intangible asset. PENNSAID&reg; gel remains in development. To further expand our presence in the branded pain management market, in June 2009, our Pharmaceuticals segment entered into a licensing agreement which granted us rights to market and distribute in the United States EXALGO&reg; (hydromorphone HCL extended release once daily), a pain management drug candidate, for an up front cash payment of $10 million, which was included in research and development expenses during fiscal 2009. Under the license arrangement, we are obligated to make additional payments up to $73 million based upon the successful completion of specified development and regulatory milestones. During fiscal 2009, $10 million of such milestone payments were made and included in research and development expenses. During fiscal 2010, the FDA approved the EXALGO&reg; product, resulting in additional payments of $55 million, which were capitalized as an intangible asset. We are also required to pay royalties on sales of the product. Divestitures During fiscal 2010, we sold our sleep and oxygen therapy product lines, both previously included within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, in fiscal 2010, we sold our nuclear pharmacies in the United States and our Specialty Chemicals business, both previously included within our Pharmaceuticals segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 include a net loss on divestitures of $25 million, primarily related to the sale of our sleep therapy product line. Our Specialty Chemicals business met the criteria of a discontinued operation and, accordingly the financial statements classify this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations for further information. We plan to reallocate the resources previously used to support these product lines to our faster growing, higher margin businesses in which we have or can develop a global competitive advantage. During fiscal 2009, we sold our sleep diagnostics product line within our Medical Devices segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2009 includes charges totaling $21 million for the loss on sale of our sleep diagnostics product line and the write down of our oxygen therapy product line to its fair value less cost to sell based on the sale agreement. During fiscal 2008, we sold our Retail Products segment and our European Incontinence Products business within our Medical Supplies segment because their products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. Both of these businesses met the discontinued operations criteria and, accordingly, have been included in discontinued operations. See Discontinued Operations for further information. Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations Restructuring Initiatives In fiscal 2009, we launched a restructuring program designed to improve our cost structure and to deliver improved operational growth. This program includes actions across all three segments as well as corporate. We expect to incur charges of approximately $200 million under this program, most of which is expected to occur by the end of 2011. These charges have been or will be recorded as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives are identified and approved. The anticipated expenditures primarily relate to employee severance and benefits. As of September 24, 2010, we had incurred $115 million of restructuring charges under this program since its inception. This program excludes restructuring actions associated with acquisitions. In addition to continuing to incur charges under the 2009 program, we also expect to incur additional charges as restructuring actions stemming from our recent acquisitions are implemented. 2010 Form 10 K 34 Table of Contents In fiscal 2007, prior to our separation from Tyco International, we launched a $150 million restructuring program, primarily in our Medical Devices and Medical Supplies segments. This program included exiting unprofitable product lines in low growth and declining growth markets, reducing excess machine capacity, moving production to lower cost alternatives through plant consolidations and outsourcing initiatives, and relocating certain functions. During fiscal 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $77 million under this program as we continued to consolidate certain facilities, primarily within the Medical Devices segment. This program was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2008. Research and Development Investment Our research and development expense increased $20 million and $86 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 include $30 million of up front fees and milestone payments incurred in connection with the PENNSAID&reg; and EXALGO&reg; product license arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. We expect research and development expenditures to continue to increase in fiscal 2011, both as a result of our recent acquisition of ev3 and internal research and development initiatives. We intend to focus our research and development investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. We are committed to investing in products that have a demonstrable clinical impact and value to the healthcare system and through which we can benefit from our core competencies and global infrastructure. Sales and Marketing Investment Selling and marketing expenses increased $156 million in fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased costs resulting from recent acquisitions and planned increases to support product launches. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in fiscal 2011, as a result of our recent acquisition of ev3 and as we make investments to drive our future growth. Legal Settlements During fiscal 2010, we recorded a $33 million charge to settle an antitrust case, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $94 million to settle three antitrust cases, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $183 million for our share of Tyco Internationals settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining Tyco International securities cases outstanding at that time. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a net shareholder settlement charge of $42 million, comprised of a $58 million charge for our portion of Tyco Internationals settlements of several securities cases, partially offset by $16 million of income for our portion of related insurance recoveries. Currency Exchange Rates Our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2010 is as follows: U.S. Dollar 56 % Euro 19 Japanese Yen 8 All other 17 100 % 35 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended 2010, 2009 and 2008 The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales: Fiscal Years (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net sales $ 10,429 100.0 % $ 10,263 100.0 % $ 9,910 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 4,624 44.3 4,622 45.0 4,601 46.4 Gross profit 5,805 55.7 5,641 55.0 5,309 53.6 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,219 30.9 3,042 29.6 2,881 29.1 Research and development expenses 447 4.3 427 4.2 341 3.4 Restructuring charges 76 0.7 61 0.6 77 0.8 Shareholder settlements, net of insurance recoveries 183 1.8 42 0.4 In process research and development charges 115 1.1 22 0.2 Operating income 2,063 19.8 1,813 17.7 1,946 19.6 Interest expense (199 ) (1.9 ) (175 ) (1.7 ) (209 ) (2.1 ) Interest income 22 0.2 24 0.2 43 0.4 Other income, net 40 0.4 145 1.4 199 2.0 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,926 18.5 1,807 17.6 1,979 20.0 Income tax expense 363 3.5 865 8.4 536 5.4 Income from continuing operations 1,563 15.0 942 9.2 1,443 14.6 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 69 0.7 (35 ) (0.3 ) (82 ) (0.8 ) Net income $ 1,632 15.6 $ 907 8.8 $ 1,361 13.7 Net sales Our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $166 million, or 1.6%, to $10.429 billion, compared with $10.263 billion in fiscal 2009. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a $198 million increase to net sales in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2009 includes $354 million of sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets sold under a license agreement, which ended during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The remaining sales increase was driven by sales growth within our Medical Devices segment largely resulting from acquisitions, partially offset by decreased sales within our Pharmaceuticals segments, primarily due to decreased sales of generic pharmaceuticals and the sale of our nuclear pharmacies in the United States. Our net sales for fiscal 2009 increased $353 million, or 3.6%, to $10.263 billion, compared with $9.910 billion in fiscal 2008. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a $429 million decrease to net sales in fiscal 2009. The remaining increase in net sales was primarily driven by increased sales within our Medical Devices segment and $297 million of incremental sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets within our Pharmaceuticals segment. Net sales generated by our businesses in the United States were $5.725 billion, $5.925 billion and $5.442 billion in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our non U.S. businesses generated net sales of $4.704 billion, $4.338 billion and $4.468 billion in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our business outside the United States represents approximately 45%, 42% and 45% of our net sales for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The lower proportion of non U.S. net sales in fiscal 2009, compared with the other two years is largely attributable to the fiscal 2009 sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets in the United States. 2010 Form 10 K 36 Table of Contents Net sales by geographic area are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (1) (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 5,725 $ 5,925 (3 )% % (3 )% Other Americas 653 549 19 12 7 Europe 2,605 2,510 4 1 3 Asia Pacific 1,446 1,279 13 8 5 $ 10,429 $ 10,263 2 2 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (1) (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 5,925 $ 5,442 9 % % 9 % Other Americas 549 575 (5 ) (17 ) 12 Europe 2,510 2,753 (9 ) (13 ) 4 Asia Pacific 1,279 1,140 12 2 10 $ 10,263 $ 9,910 4 (4 ) 8 (1) Operational growth, a non GAAP financial measure, measures the change in sales between current and prior year periods using a constant currency, the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. We have provided this non GAAP financial measure because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation. This non GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Costs of goods sold Cost of goods sold was 44.3% of net sales for fiscal 2010, compared with 45.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The decreases in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix and increased sales volume in the Medical Devices segment. However, this decrease was partially offset by the absence of sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets during fiscal 2010, which resulted in an increase of 1.5 percentage points. Cost of goods sold was 45.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009, compared with 46.4% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix in the Pharmaceuticals segment, resulting largely from sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets, which resulted in a decrease of 1.3 percentage points. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $177 million, or 5.8%, to $3.219 billion, compared with $3.042 billion in fiscal 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.9% of net sales for fiscal 2010, compared with 29.6% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased costs resulting from recent acquisitions and planned increases to support product launches. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $161 million, or 5.6%, to $3.042 billion in fiscal 2009, compared with $2.881 billion in fiscal 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 29.6% of net sales for fiscal 2009, compared with 29.1% of net sales for fiscal 2008. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased legal and consulting costs, $94 million of which related to three antitrust cases, an increase in estimated environmental remediation costs of $82 million, primarily related to a site in Orrington, Maine, and planned growth in selling and marketing. These cost increases were partially offset by currency gains. 37 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Research and development expenses Research and development expense increased $20 million to $447 million, in fiscal 2010, compared with $427 million in fiscal 2009. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2009 include $30 million of up front fees and milestone payments for licensing arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. The remaining $50 million increase, primarily resulted from additional spending within our Medical Devices segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expense was 4.3% for fiscal 2010, compared with and 4.2% for fiscal 2009. We plan to increase research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to 5% to 6% over the next several years. Research and development expense increased $86 million, or 25.2%, to $427 million in fiscal 2009, compared with $341 million in fiscal 2008. This increase resulted primarily from the $30 million of up front fees and milestone payments for licensing agreements discussed above and increased spending in our Medical Devices segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 4.2% for fiscal 2009, compared with 3.4% for fiscal 2008. Restructuring charges During fiscal 2010, we recorded net restructuring charges of $76 million primarily related to severance costs within our Medical Supplies and Medical Devices segments. During fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of $61 million, comprised of restructuring charges of $66 million, partially offset by changes in estimates of $5 million. The $66 million of restructuring charges includes asset impairment charges of $12 million primarily related to the write down of long lived assets of a manufacturing facility within our Pharmaceutical segment, which has been closed as a result of cost savings initiatives. The remaining charges and changes in estimates primarily relate to severance costs across all segments and corporate. During fiscal 2008, we recorded restructuring charges of $77 million, which is comprised of restructuring charges of $83 million, partially offset by changes in estimates of $6 million. The $83 million of restructuring charges includes asset impairment charges of $18 million primarily related to the write down of long lived assets of a manufacturing facility within our Medical Devices segment, which has been closed as a result of cost savings initiatives. The remaining charges and changes in estimates primarily relate to workforce reductions also within Medical Devices. Shareholder settlements, net of insurance recoveries During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $183 million for our share of Tyco Internationals settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining Tyco International securities cases outstanding at that time. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a net charge of $42 million, comprised of a $58 million charge for our share of Tyco Internationals settlements of several other securities cases, partially offset by $16 million of income for our portion of the related insurance recoveries. In process research and development charges During fiscal 2009, our Medical Devices segment recorded a charge of $59 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of VNUS. This charge relates to an alternative minimally invasive device for the treatment of varicose veins and venous reflux that VNUS is developing, which has not yet received regulatory approval. As of the date of acquisition, this technology was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. Design, testing, clinical trials and regulatory submission are required in order to bring the project to completion. If the device receives regulatory approval, we anticipate that it will occur in fiscal 2013 and be released to the market shortly thereafter. Management determined the valuation of the in process research and development using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method and was discounted at a 31% rate, which was considered commensurate with the projects risks and stage of development. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from the project were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the project and technology involved. These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the project to completion. We cannot assure that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will prove to be accurate or that the 2010 Form 10 K 38 Table of Contents timely completion of the project to commercial success will occur. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties associated with research and development projects. In addition to this charge, during fiscal 2009, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges of $56 million for the write off of in process research and development, of which $36 million was associated with the acquisition of PMI and $20 million with the acquisition of intellectual property. During fiscal 2008, our Medical Devices segment recorded a charge of $12 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of Scandius. In addition to this charge, our Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals segments recorded in process research and development charges totaling $10 million in connection with two smaller acquisitions. These above in process research and development charges related to the development of second generation technology that had not yet obtained regulatory approval. Operating income In fiscal 2010, operating income increased $250 million to $2.063 billion, compared with operating income of $1.813 billion in fiscal 2009. Operating income for fiscal 2009 included: $345 million related to sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets; $183 million of shareholder settlement charges; $115 million of in process research and development charges; charges totaling $71 million for the estimated additional cost to remediate environmental matters at a site located in Orrington, Maine; and $30 million of up front fees and milestone payments for licensing arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. The remaining $196 million increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable sales mix and increased sales volume within our Medical Devices segment and a $61 million decrease in legal charges associated with the settlement of antitrust cases, partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions and new product launches. In fiscal 2009, operating income decreased $133 million to $1.813 billion, compared with $1.946 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to: a $141 million increase in net shareholder settlements; increased legal costs, $94 million of which related to three antitrust cases; $93 million of incremental in process research and development charges; an $86 million increase in research and development expenses primarily related to increased spending in our Medical Devices segment and licensing arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment; and an $82 million increase in estimated environmental remediation costs, primarily related to a site located in Orrington, Maine. These decreases to operating income were partially offset by higher sales and increased gross profit largely attributable to increased sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets. Analysis of Operating Results by Segment Management measures and evaluates our reportable segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non recurring or non operational are excluded from segment net sales and segment operating income because management evaluates the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items include revenues and expenses related to sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release (Oxy ER) tablets sold under a license agreement, which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, and charges associated with acquisitions, divestitures, licensing fees, certain legal and environmental charges, and restructuring charges incurred under our 2007 and 2009 restructuring programs. Although these amounts are excluded from segment net sales and segment operating income, as applicable, they are included in reported consolidated net sales and operating income and accordingly, are included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations. In addition, certain costs that were previously included in corporate expense, primarily stock based compensation expense, are now reflected in the Companys reportable segments, consistent with how management is now measuring and evaluating segment performance. Prior period segment net sales and segment operating income amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 39 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Net sales by segment are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Medical Devices $ 6,715 $ 6,061 11 % 3 % 8 % Pharmaceuticals 1,991 2,096 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Medical Supplies 1,723 1,752 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales of reportable segments 10,429 9,909 5 2 3 Sales of Oxy ER 354 (100 ) (100 ) Consolidated net sales $ 10,429 $ 10,263 2 2 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 Medical Devices $ 6,061 $ 5,914 2 % (6 )% 8 % Pharmaceuticals 2,096 2,150 (3 ) (4 ) 1 Medical Supplies 1,752 1,789 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales of reportable segments 9,909 9,853 1 (4 ) 5 Sales of Oxy ER 354 57 521 521 Consolidated net sales $ 10,263 $ 9,910 4 (4 ) 8 Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for each of the last three fiscal years is shown in the following table: Fiscal Years (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Medical Devices $ 2,097 31.2 % $ 1,849 30.5 % $ 1,843 31.2 % Pharmaceuticals 330 16.6 343 16.4 378 17.6 Medical Supplies 254 14.7 225 12.8 198 11.1 Operating income of reportable segments 2,681 25.7 2,417 24.4 2,419 24.6 Unallocated amounts: Corporate expenses (419 ) (392 ) (379 ) Restructuring charges (76 ) (61 ) (77 ) Legal and environmental charges, including shareholder settlements (33 ) (330 ) (42 ) Charges associated with acquisitions, divestitures and licensing arrangements (90 ) (166 ) (22 ) Impact of Oxy ER 345 47 Consolidated operating income $ 2,063 $ 1,813 $ 1,946 2010 Form 10 K 40 Table of Contents Medical Devices Net sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Endomechanical Instruments $ 2,139 $ 1,982 8 % 3 % 5 % Soft Tissue Repair Products 854 807 6 3 3 Energy Devices 992 867 14 2 12 Oximetry & Monitoring Products 755 636 19 2 17 Airway & Ventilation Products 770 763 1 3 (2 ) Vascular Products 810 574 41 3 38 Other Products 395 432 (9 ) 6 (15 ) $ 6,715 $ 6,061 11 3 8 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 2,839 $ 2,528 12 % % 12 % Non U.S. 3,876 3,533 10 5 5 $ 6,715 $ 6,061 11 3 8 Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $654 million to $6.715 billion, compared with $6.061 billion for fiscal 2009.

The remaining increase in net sales for the segment was driven by increased sales across all major product groups, except Airway & Ventilation Products. The increase in sales for Vascular Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of ev3 and VNUS, which together resulted in an additional $195 million in net sales for the segment. Similarly, the increase in sales for Oximetry & Monitoring Products resulted primarily from the acquisition of Aspect. The increase in Energy Devices net sales resulted primarily from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products, while the increase in sales of Endomechanical Instruments was primarily driven by continued demand for our stapling devices and, to a lesser extent, laparoscopic instruments. Finally, the increase in sales for Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily attributable to hernia mesh products. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Airway & Ventilation Products, primarily due to the divestiture of the sleep diagnostics and sleep therapy product lines, and a $63 million decrease in sales due to the divestiture of our oxygen therapy product line, included in Other Products. Operating income for fiscal 2010 increased $248 million to $2.097 billion, compared with $1.849 billion for fiscal 2009. Our operating margin was 31.2% for fiscal 2010, compared with 30.5% for fiscal 2009. The increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance for the overall segment discussed above. This increase was partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions, primarily selling, general and administrative expenses and, to a lesser extent, research and development expenses. 41 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Net sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 Endomechanical Instruments $ 1,982 $ 1,928 3 % (6 )% 9 % Soft Tissue Repair Products 807 786 3 (7 ) 10 Energy Devices 867 805 8 (5 ) 13 Oximetry & Monitoring Products 636 636 (3 ) 3 Airway & Ventilation Products 763 806 (5 ) (4 ) (1 ) Vascular Products 574 493 16 (2 ) 18 Other Products 432 460 (6 ) (5 ) (1 ) $ 6,061 $ 5,914 2 (6 ) 8 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 2,528 $ 2,315 9 % % 9 % Non U.S. 3,533 3,599 (2 ) (9 ) 7 $ 6,061 $ 5,914 2 (6 ) 8 Net sales for fiscal 2009 increased $147 million to $6.061 billion, compared with $5.914 billion for fiscal 2008. Unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations of $317 million during fiscal 2009 were more than offset by increased sales volume of endomechanical instruments, energy devices, vascular products and soft tissue repair products. The increase in sales volume for Endomechanical Instruments was primarily driven by continued demand for our stapling devices and laparoscopic instruments worldwide. The increase in operational sales for Energy Devices resulted primarily from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products worldwide, somewhat offset by a decrease in capital equipment sales in the United States. Vascular Products sales growth was primarily driven by increased sales of compression products in the United States and the acquisition of VNUS. The increase in sales volume for Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily due to hernia mesh products in the United States and, to a lesser extent, hernia mechanical devices. Operating income for fiscal 2009 increased $6 million to $1.849 billion, compared with $1.843 billion for fiscal 2008. Our operating margin was 30.5% for fiscal 2009, compared with 31.2% for fiscal 2008. The decline in operating margin resulted from a $54 million increase in research and development expense. The slight increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix and increased gross profit, partially offset by the increase in research and development spending. Pharmaceuticals Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Specialty Pharmaceuticals $ 473 $ 544 (13 )% % (13 )% Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 395 405 (2 ) 1 (3 ) Contrast Products 604 591 2 2 Radiopharmaceuticals 519 556 (7 ) (7 ) $ 1,991 $ 2,096 (5 ) 1 (6 ) 2010 Form 10 K 42 Table of Contents Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 1,372 $ 1,509 (9 )% % (9 )% Non U.S. 619 587 5 3 2 $ 1,991 $ 2,096 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Net sales for fiscal 2010 decreased $105 million to $1.991 billion, compared with $2.096 billion for fiscal 2009. The decrease primarily resulted from a decline in Specialty Pharmaceuticals and Radiopharmaceuticals net sales. The decrease in Specialty Pharmaceuticals sales was attributable to a decline in sales of generic pharmaceuticals, primarily hydrocodone and oxycodone, resulting from aggressive price competition and, to a lesser extent, to lower sales of branded pharmaceuticals. The decrease in sales of branded pharmaceuticals was largely due to a decline in sales of Restoril, for which our patent recently expired. This decrease was partially offset by sales of EXALGO&reg; and PENNSAID&reg; products, which were launched in fiscal 2010. The sale of our nuclear pharmacies in the United States also contributed to the decline in net sales for the segment. The decreases discussed above were somewhat offset by favorable currency translation. Operating income for fiscal 2010 decreased $13 million to $330 million, compared with $343 million for fiscal 2009. Our operating margin was 16.6% for fiscal 2010, compared with 16.4% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit resulting from the overall segment sales decline discussed above and increased selling and marketing expenses to support new branded product launches, partially offset by lower legal costs. Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 Specialty Pharmaceuticals $ 544 $ 525 4 % % 4 % Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 405 431 (6 ) (7 ) 1 Contrast Products 591 635 (7 ) (5 ) (2 ) Radiopharmaceuticals 556 559 (1 ) (4 ) 3 $ 2,096 $ 2,150 (3 ) (4 ) 1 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 1,509 $ 1,558 (3 )% % (3 )% Non U.S. 587 592 (1 ) (14 ) 13 $ 2,096 $ 2,150 (3 ) (4 ) 1 Net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $54 million to $2.096 billion, compared with $2.150 billion for fiscal 2008. Unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations contributed $81 million to the decrease in net sales. The remaining $27 million increase primarily resulted from higher sales of generic pharmaceuticals within Specialty Pharmaceuticals. Operating income for fiscal 2009 decreased $35 million to $343 million, compared with $378 million for fiscal 2008. Our operating margin was 16.4% for fiscal 2009, compared with 17.6% for fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased environmental costs and increased research and development expenses, partially resulting from incremental expenses incurred in connection with licensing agreements entered into during fiscal 2009. 43 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Medical Supplies Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Nursing Care Products $ 783 $ 790 (1 )% % (1 )% Medical Surgical Products 412 417 (1 ) (1 ) SharpSafety Products 320 334 (4 ) (4 ) Original Equipment Manufacturer Products 208 211 (1 ) 1 (2 ) $ 1,723 $ 1,752 (2 ) (2 ) Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 1,514 $ 1,534 (1 )% % (1 )% Non U.S. 209 218 (4 ) 1 (5 ) $ 1,723 $ 1,752 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales for fiscal 2010 decreased $29 million to $1.723 billion, compared with $1.752 billion for fiscal 2009. The decrease resulted from lower sales across all product lines, most notably SharpSafety Products. The sales decrease in SharpSafety Products resulted from a decline in both sharps disposal products and needles and syringes due to pricing pressure and the exit of these product lines in Europe in the prior year. The decline in sales of Nursing Care Products was largely driven by decreased sales of traditional wound care products, partially offset by increased sales volume of incontinence products. Operating income for fiscal 2010 increased $29 million to $254 million, compared with $225 million for fiscal 2009. Our operating margin was 14.7% for fiscal 2010, compared with 12.8% for fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to decreased manufacturing costs and lower selling and marketing expenses primarily attributable to savings from restructuring actions. Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 is as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 Nursing Care Products $ 790 $ 784 1 % (1 )% 2 % Medical Surgical Products 417 431 (3 ) (3 ) SharpSafety Products 334 362 (8 ) (1 ) (7 ) Original Equipment Manufacturer Products 211 212 $ 1,752 $ 1,789 (2 ) (2 ) Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2009 2008 U.S. $ 1,534 $ 1,512 1 % % 1 % Non U.S. 218 277 (21 ) (11 ) (10 ) $ 1,752 $ 1,789 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales for fiscal 2009 decreased $37 million to $1.752 billion, compared with $1.789 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of $31 million and a decline in sales of needles and syringes within SharpSafety primarily resulting from our decision to exit this business in 2010 Form 10 K 44 Table of Contents Europe. These decreases in net sales were partially offset by an increase in incontinence sales within Nursing Care Products resulting primarily from new products, particularly quilted and bariatric briefs. Operating income for fiscal 2009 increased $27 million to $225 million, compared with $198 million for fiscal 2008. Our operating margin was 12.8% for fiscal 2009, compared with 11.1% for fiscal 2008. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily attributable to a decrease in research and development expense and lower selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to savings resulting from restructuring actions. Corporate Corporate expense was $419 million, $392 million and $379 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. The $27 million increase in corporate expense in fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, resulted primarily from increased compensation costs and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs, partially offset by decreased tax departmental costs. Non Operating Items Interest Expense and Interest Income During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, interest expense was $199 million, $175 million and $209 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, resulted partially from $13 million of fees associated with the bridge financing obtained in connection with the acquisition of ev3. No amount was drawn down under this bridge facility since permanent financing was put in place prior to the close of the ev3 acquisition. The remaining $11 million increase in interest expense resulted from the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 to finance a portion of the ev3 acquisition. We anticipate that the issuance of these notes will result in additional interest expense of approximately $46 million on an annualized basis. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008, resulted from a decrease in our average outstanding debt balances. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, interest income was $22 million, $24 million and $43 million, respectively. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008, resulted from a decrease in interest rates. Other Income, net Other income, net of $40 million for fiscal 2010 includes income of $43 million and a corresponding increase to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, which reflects 58% of interest and other income tax payable amounts recorded during fiscal 2010 that will be covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in note 19 to our financial statements. Other income, net of $145 million for fiscal 2009 includes income of $148 million and a corresponding increase to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, which reflects 58% of interest and other income tax payable amounts recorded during fiscal 2009 that will be covered under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The $148 million includes income of $107 million which represents the effect of Tyco Internationals settlement of certain outstanding tax matters with the IRS on our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. Other income, net of $199 million for fiscal 2008 includes income of $214 million and a corresponding increase to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. The $214 million includes $231 million which represents the indirect effect of changes to our accounting for uncertain income tax positions discussed in note 6 to our financial statements. Other income, net for fiscal 2008 also includes income of $21 million related to an increase in our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics in accordance with the Tax Sharing 45 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Agreement, primarily related to interest. These amounts are partially offset by adjustments to certain pre separation tax contingencies and an audit settlement, which resulted in a $38 million decrease to our receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics and a corresponding charge to other expense. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $363 million, $865 million and $536 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.926 billion, $1.807 billion and $1.979 billion for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 18.8%, 47.9% and 27.1% for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The significant decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009 resulted from the release of a significant non U.S. valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 upon finalization of a non U.S. tax planning initiative. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was also due to withholding tax incurred on repatriated earnings in the prior year period. During fiscal 2009, we provided for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and a 5% withholding tax on earnings that were repatriated during that period (i) in connection with a one time transaction that was implemented as part of our tax planning strategies and (ii) in jurisdictions where we were not permanently reinvested. In addition, in fiscal 2009 we incurred charges of $183 million related to our portion of Tyco Internationals shareholder settlements and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining securities cases outstanding at that time, for which no tax benefit was recorded. Finally, the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009 also resulted from the implementation of our tax planning strategies and an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009, compared with fiscal 2008, resulted from the effect of Tyco Internationals settlement with the IRS of certain outstanding tax matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle and withholding tax incurred on repatriated earnings. We, together with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics have significant potential tax liabilities related to periods prior to the separation from Tyco International. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to and including June 29, 2007. The timing, nature and amount of any settlement agreed to by Tyco International may not be in our best interests. In September 2009, Tyco International agreed to a negotiated settlement of certain matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle, although the cycle remains open and subject to examination and resolution. In addition, during fiscal 2009, we provided for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and a 5% withholding tax in the amount of $167 million on earnings that were repatriated in connection with the implementation of our tax planning strategies. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was also due to $141 million of incremental net shareholder settlement charges and $93 million of incremental in process research and development charges, for which no tax benefit was recorded. Discontinued Operations In fiscal 2010, we sold our Specialty Chemicals business within our Pharmaceuticals segment. In addition, in fiscal 2008, we sold our Retail Products segment and European Incontinence Products business within our Medical Supplies segment. We decided to sell these businesses because their products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. All of these businesses met the discontinued operations criteria, and accordingly are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Specialty Chemicals business During fiscal 2010, we sold our Specialty Chemicals business for net cash proceeds of $273 million and recorded a $20 million pre tax gain on sale. Included within this gain is a $22 million charge associated with an indemnification for various risks, which we provided to the purchaser. In addition, we paid $30 million into an escrow account as collateral for this indemnification, which is included in other assets on the balance sheet. Additional information regarding this indemnification is discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources Guarantees. 2010 Form 10 K 46 Table of Contents Retail Products segment During fiscal 2008, we sold our Retail Products segment for gross cash proceeds of $330 million, subject to working capital adjustments. Deal costs and other adjustments resulted in net cash proceeds of $308 million, which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. A $111 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations was recorded at that time. The loss on sale was adjusted by $12 million in fiscal 2009 upon receipt of contingent payments and net proceeds from the sale of a Retail Products facility and by $7 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of an unfavorable contract settlement. European Incontinence business During fiscal 2008, we also sold our European Incontinence business. As a condition of the sale, we were required to contribute cash of $43 million into the business prior to the closing of the transaction. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a $75 million pre tax loss on sale from discontinued operations. Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses During fiscal 2010, we recorded a $20 million tax benefit in income (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations resulting primarily from adjustments to certain income tax liabilities related to the Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses that were sold in fiscal 2006 prior to our separation from Tyco International Ltd. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. We believe, however, that our cash balances and other sources of liquidity, primarily our committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Fiscal 2010 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by operating activities of $2.185 billion was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes. An increase of income taxes payable of $312 million also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities. These amounts were partially offset by a $200 million decrease in accrued and other current liabilities, driven largely by the payment of prior year legal settlements. The net cash used in investing activities of $3.195 billion was primarily due to acquisition related payments of $3.012 billion, primarily associated with the acquisition of ev3 and capital expenditures of $401 million. These amounts were partially offset by $263 million of net proceeds from divestitures, primarily related to the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business. The net cash provided by financing activities of $1.060 billion was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1.489 billion and net proceeds from commercial paper of $246 million. These amounts were partially offset by dividend payments of $360 million and share repurchases of $331 million. Fiscal 2009 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $1.829 billion was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2009, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, the change in related party receivable on the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Other Income, net, deferred income taxes and in process research and development charges and an increase in working capital of $394 million driven primarily by accrued and other liabilities and income taxes payable. The increase in accrued and other liabilities includes $72 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs and $58 million relating to an antitrust legal settlement. A majority of the increase in income taxes relates to our portion of Tyco Internationals settlement with the IRS of certain outstanding tax matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle. During fiscal 2009, we paid $151 million for our portion of Tyco Internationals settlements with certain shareholders. In addition, we paid $129 million for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and withholding tax on earnings that were either repatriated or undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in certain subsidiaries. 47 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.001 billion was primarily due to acquisition related payments of $608 million, primarily associated with the acquisition of VNUS, and capital expenditures of $384 million. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $573 million was primarily the result of dividend payments of $322 million and repurchases of shares totaling $232 million discussed under Share Repurchases. Fiscal 2008 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $591 million was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and the change in related party receivable on the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Other Income, net. An increase in accrued and other liabilities of $190 million, a significant portion of which relates to accrued interest, also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities. These amounts were partially offset by the finalization of Tyco Internationals class action settlement of $1.257 billion, an increase in inventories of $190 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $138 million. The finalization of the class action settlement did not affect our cash balance, however, as the funds had previously been set aside in an escrow account during fiscal 2007. The net cash provided by continuing investing activities of $996 million was primarily due to the release of our interest in Tyco Internationals class action settlement fund of $1.257 billion and $263 million in net proceeds from the divestitures, primarily related to our Retail Products segment and European Incontinence business. These amounts were partially offset by capital expenditures of $409 million and acquisition activity of $157 million, primarily related to the acquisitions of TSL and Scandius. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $1.283 billion was primarily the result of the repayment of debt of $4.007 billion, primarily associated with borrowings under our bridge loan facility and dividend payments of $320 million. These payments were largely offset by the issuance of debt of $2.727 billion, net proceeds from commercial paper of $171 million and proceeds from option exercises of $157 million. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $8.974 billion, or $18.13 per share, at September 24, 2010, compared with $8.001 billion, or $16.03 per share, at September 25, 2009. Net income of $1.632 billion was largely offset by dividends declared of $370 million and the repurchase of shares of $331 million. At September 24, 2010, total debt was $4.706 billion and cash was $1.565 billion, compared with total debt of $2.991 billion and cash of $1.467 billion at September 25, 2009. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 34% at September 24, 2010, compared with 27% at September 25, 2009. The increase in our total debt resulted from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 1.9% senior notes due 2013, $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.8% senior notes due 2015 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.2% senior notes due 2020. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by both Covidien plc and Covidien Ltd. The net proceeds of $1.489 billion were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of ev3. We are required to maintain an available unused balance under our $1.425 billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We had $397 million and $151 million of commercial paper outstanding at September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, and no amount outstanding under the credit facility at the end of either period. 2010 Form 10 K 48 Table of Contents Our credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreement contains other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Dividends Dividend payments were $360 million during fiscal 2010. On September 22, 2010, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.18 per share to $0.20 per share. The dividend declared of $0.20 per share to shareholders of record on October 4, 2010, totaling $99 million, was paid on November 8, 2010. We expect that we will continue to pay dividends comparable to this increased amount to holders of our ordinary shares. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Share Repurchases During fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to $300 million of our ordinary shares to partially offset dilution related to equity compensation plans. Shares may be repurchased from time to time, based on market conditions. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 6 million ordinary shares for $225 million under this program. We also repurchase shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. In addition, we repurchase shares to settle certain option exercises. During fiscal 2009, we spent an additional $7 million to acquire shares in connection with such share based awards. In fiscal 2009, prior to the reorganization discussed note 1 to our financial statements, we retired the 2.1 million shares that Covidien Ltd. held in treasury. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our ordinary shares primarily to offset dilution related to equity compensation plans. Shares may be repurchased from time to time, based on market conditions. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $325 million under our share buyback programs. In addition, we spent an additional $6 million to acquire shares in connection with share based awards as described above. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 24, 2010 is presented in the following table. (Dollars in Millions) Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 7,149 $ 454 $ 597 $ 1,186 $ 169 $ 563 $ 4,180 Capital lease obligations(1) 54 7 6 6 6 6 23 Operating leases(2) 494 120 88 67 55 46 118 Purchase obligations(3) 179 125 26 15 11 2 Unrecognized tax benefits(4) 1,218 1,218 Total contractual cash obligations(5) $ 9,094 $ 1,924 $ 717 $ 1,274 $ 241 $ 617 $ 4,321 (1) Interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of September 24, 2010. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. 49 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents (2) Total future operating lease payments increased $59 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of acquisitions. (3) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of good and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. (4) The table above does not include $641 million of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $276 million of associated accrued interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Information regarding expected audit settlements and estimated change in our unrecognized tax benefits is provided under Income Taxes. (5) This table does not include other liabilities of $990 million, primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, insurable liabilities and deferred compensation, because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be $43 million in fiscal 2011. In addition, we expect to make contributions of $10 million to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2011. At September 24, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $338 million. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. We believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Item 3 Legal Proceedings and note 21 to our financial statements provide further information regarding legal proceedings. Income Taxes Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. Open periods for examination include certain periods during which we were a subsidiary of Tyco International. The resolution of the matters arising during periods during which we were a Tyco International subsidiary is subject to the conditions set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in note 19 to our financial statements. Tyco International has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to the separation. We have significant potential tax liabilities related to these periods and have included our best estimate of the amounts which relate to our operations within our current or non current income taxes payable. Our income tax returns for years after our separation from Tyco are also periodically under examination. We have potential liabilities related to these income tax returns and have included our best estimate of potential liabilities for these years within our non current taxes payable. With respect to these potential income tax liabilities from all of these years, we believe that the amounts recorded in our financial statements as current or non current taxes payable are adequate. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of Tyco International for periods prior to the separation, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and Tyco Electronics 31% of the total amount. We are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $1.986 billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet at September 24, 2010, $1.414 billion of which relates to periods prior to the separation and which is shared with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, some of which may not be resolved for several years. 2010 Form 10 K 50 Table of Contents In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we have recorded a current and long term receivable from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics of $245 million and $479 million, respectively, which are classified as due from former parent and affiliate on our balance sheet at September 24, 2010. These receivables primarily reflect 58% of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and Tyco Electronics default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities. The IRS has concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco Internationals U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and proposed tax adjustments, several of which also affect our income tax returns for years after 2000. Tyco International has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the IRS and Covidien believes that some of these adjustments are likely to be resolved within the next 12 months. With respect to other adjustments, Tyco International has indicated that settlement is unlikely. In the event that Tyco International is unable to resolve these issues in the IRS administrative process, Tyco International will likely contest certain adjustments related to disallowed deductions through litigation. While we believe that the amounts recorded as non current taxes payable or guaranteed contingent tax liabilities related to these adjustments are adequate, the timing and outcome of such litigation is highly uncertain and could have a significant effect on our financial statements. In addition, the IRS continues to audit certain of Tyco Internationals U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. Tyco International and the IRS have entered into settlements related to certain outstanding tax matters arising in this audit cycle, which otherwise remains open and subject to examination and resolution of other matters. In connection with the settlements of the 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 audit cycles, we estimate that we will be required to make a payment of approximately $422 million to the IRS, which is included in current income taxes payable on the balance sheet. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we will receive payments totaling approximately $245 million from Tyco International and Tyco Electronics, which is classified as current and included in due from former parent and affiliate. We will also be required to reimburse Tyco International and Tyco Electronics $108 million for our portion of their settlements. The resolution of issues arising from the 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 audit cycles, as well as other settlements or statute of limitations expirations, could result in a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that within the next 12 months, our gross uncertain tax positions, exclusive of interest could decrease by as much as $745 million, as a result of such settlements or expirations. These estimates of changes to unrecognized tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible change related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities; we assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International using appraisals and a liability related to these guarantees was recorded on our balance sheet, the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in shareholders equity. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the Agreements. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet, an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liability to the amount of such potential 51 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents loss. This guarantee is not amortized because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the Agreements, which may not occur for some years. In addition, as payments are made to indemnified parties, such payments are recorded as reductions to the liability and the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability. A liability of $716 million and $718 million relating to these guarantees was included on our balance sheet at September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. Except as discussed below, we generally do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In connection with the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business, we provided the purchaser with an indemnification for various risks, including environmental, health, safety, tax and other matters, some of which have an indefinite term. However, the most significant portion of this indemnification relates to environmental, health and safety matters, which has a term of 17 years. A liability of $22 million relating to this indemnification was included on our balance sheet as of September 24, 2010. The value of the environmental, health and safety guarantee was measured based on the probability weighted present value of the costs expected to be incurred to address environmental claims proposed under the indemnity. The maximum future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification provided to the purchaser is $82 million. In addition, we were required to pay $30 million into an escrow account as collateral, which is included in other assets on the balance sheet. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities, which are discussed in note 21 to our financial statements. In addition, we are liable for product performance, however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non U.S. jurisdictions. We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our balance sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analyses. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor specific trend 2010 Form 10 K 52 Table of Contents analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $3.149 billion, $2.831 billion, and $2.357 billion, respectively. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks, unpatented technology and customer lists. We record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years. We evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment in the same manner as goodwill. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment discussed above. Goodwill In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We utilize a two step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation, using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Contingencies We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in note 21 to our financial statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount. We record 53 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. For our U.S. plans, the discount rate is based on the market rate for a broad population of Moodys AA rated corporate bonds over $250 million. For our non U.S. plans, the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $68 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Tyco Electronics. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the Agreements. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our balance sheet, an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liability to the amount of such potential loss. This guarantee has not been amortized into income to date because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the Agreements, which may not occur for some years, or, as payments are made to indemnified parties. The impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability. In addition, we have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to our financial statements. The most significant of these guarantees relates to an indemnification, which we provided to the purchaser of our Specialty Chemicals business, primarily related to environmental, health, safety, tax and other matters. As of September 24, 2010, we have a liability of $22 million on our balance sheet related to this indemnification; however, we could be required to make payments of up to $82 million. We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. 2010 Form 10 K 54 Table of Contents We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability is established. We adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. A significant portion of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes, however, which would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have recorded significant valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions that we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $5.904 billion and $6.492 billion at September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Included in the valuation allowance at both September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009 is $5.5 billion which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non U.S. net operating losses recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling. It is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets in our balance sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income, including any future restructuring activities, may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements. The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law. 55 2010 Form 10 K Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts. Foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts outstanding at September 24, 2010, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from the September 24, 2010 market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by $35 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our balance sheet by $36 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions.
