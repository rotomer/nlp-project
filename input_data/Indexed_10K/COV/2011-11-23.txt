Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements. Overview We develop, manufacture and sell healthcare products for use in clinical and home settings. Our mission is to create and deliver innovative healthcare solutions, developed in ethical collaboration with medical professionals, which enhance the quality of life for patients and improve outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. We manage and operate our business through the following three segments: Medical Devices includes the development, manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments, energy devices, soft tissue repair products, vascular products, oximetry and monitoring products, airway and ventilation products and other medical products. Pharmaceuticals includes the development, manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals. Medical Supplies includes the development, manufacture and sale of nursing care products, medical surgical products, SharpSafety products and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products. Effective June 29, 2007, Covidien became the parent company owning the former healthcare businesses of Tyco International Ltd. As part of a plan to separate Tyco International into three independent companies, Tyco International transferred the equity interests of the entities that held all of the assets and liabilities of its healthcare businesses to Covidien and, on June 29, 2007, distributed all of its shares of Covidien and TE Connectivity Ltd. (formerly Tyco Electronics Ltd.) to Tyco International shareholders (the separation). Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Healthcare Reform In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. This legislation includes a provision that imposes a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of such devices in the United States starting after December 31, 2012. The legislation also includes a $28 billion fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry over nine years starting in 2011 and a $2.8 billion annual fee on branded pharmaceuticals thereafter. The amount of branded pharmaceutical fee payable by each company is based upon market share. Since our branded pharmaceutical sales currently represent a small portion of the total market, this annual assessment has not had a significant impact on Covidien. The medical devices tax, however, may have a significant impact on our results of operations. While we are waiting for further regulations to be established, we continue to evaluate the potential impact that this tax may have on our overall business. U.S. net sales of potentially taxable medical devices represented approximately 30% to 40% of our total net sales in fiscal 2011 and, therefore, this tax burden may have a material, negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows. In addition to the excise tax and annual fee described above, the new legislation contains numerous other provisions, many of which pertain to health insurance plans, which could impact our financial results in future periods. 29 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Strategic Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements and Divestitures We regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. We have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions, as well as divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses. Acquisitions In November 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire B&Acirc;RRX Medical, Inc. for approximately $325 million, with future earn out payments possible based on achievement of specific milestones. B&Acirc;RRX is a developer of bipolar radiofrequency ablation devices used in the treatment of Barretts esophagus syndrome. The acquisition of B&Acirc;RRX will expand our ability to treat gastrointestinal diseases. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. In July 2010, our Medical Devices segment acquired ev3 Inc., a developer of technologies for the endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular and neurovascular diseases, for cash of approximately $2.5 billion, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of ev3 expanded our vascular intervention product offerings and presence in the vascular market. In addition, in July 2010, our Medical Devices segment acquired Somanetics Corporation, a developer of cerebral and somatic oximetry and monitoring systems, for cash of $291 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of Somanetics expanded our oximetry and monitoring product portfolio and our presence in the operating room. In November 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. (Aspect), a provider of brain monitoring technology, for cash of $150 million, net of cash acquired. In addition, we assumed $58 million of debt in the transaction, which we subsequently repaid. The acquisition of Aspect expanded our product offerings and added a brain monitoring technology to our product portfolio. In September 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired Power Medical Interventions, Inc. (PMI), a provider of computer assisted, power actuated surgical cutting and stapling products, for cash of $40 million. In addition, we assumed $25 million of debt in the transaction. The acquisition of PMI expanded our surgical stapling solutions. In June 2009, our Medical Devices segment acquired VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc. (VNUS), a developer of medical devices for minimally invasive treatment of venous reflux disease, for cash of $476 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of VNUS expanded our portfolio of vascular intervention products and our presence in the vascular market. Licensing Agreements To expand our entry into the branded pain management market, in June 2009, our Pharmaceuticals segment entered into a licensing agreement which granted us rights to market and distribute PENNSAID&reg; topical solution and PENNSAID&reg; viscous solution, product candidates for the treatment of osteoarthritis. This license arrangement included an upfront cash payment of $10 million, which was included in research and development expenses during fiscal 2009. We are also responsible for all future development activities and expenses. In addition, we may be required to make additional payments up to $120 million based upon the successful completion of specified regulatory and sales milestones, and are required to pay royalties on sales of the products. During fiscal 2010, upon FDA approval of PENNSAID&reg; topical solution, we made a milestone payment of $15 million, which was capitalized as an intangible asset. PENNSAID&reg; viscous solution remains in development. 2011 Form 10 K 30 Table of Contents To further expand our presence in the branded pain management market, in June 2009, our Pharmaceuticals segment entered into a licensing agreement which granted us rights to market and distribute in the United States EXALGO&reg; (hydromorphone HCL extended release once daily), a pain management drug candidate, for an upfront cash payment of $10 million, which was included in research and development expenses during fiscal 2009. Under the license arrangement, we are obligated to make additional payments up to $73 million based upon the successful completion of specified development and regulatory milestones. During fiscal 2009, $10 million of such milestone payments were made and included in research and development expenses. During fiscal 2010, the FDA approved the EXALGO&reg; product, resulting in additional payments of $55 million, which were capitalized as an intangible asset. We are also required to pay royalties on sales of the product. Divestitures During fiscal 2010, we sold our sleep and oxygen therapy product lines, both previously included within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, in fiscal 2010, we sold our nuclear pharmacies in the United States and our Specialty Chemicals business, both previously included within our Pharmaceuticals segment. During fiscal 2010, we recorded a net loss on divestitures of $25 million, primarily related to the sale of our sleep therapy product line. Our Specialty Chemicals business met the criteria of a discontinued operation and, accordingly has been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations for further information. During fiscal 2009, we sold our sleep diagnostics product line within our Medical Devices segment. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $21 million for the loss on sale of our sleep diagnostics product line and the write down of our oxygen therapy product line to its fair value less cost to sell based on the sale agreement. Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations Fiscal Year We report our results based on a 52 53 week year ending on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2011 ended on September 30, 2011 and consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on September 24, 2010 and September 25, 2009, respectively. The additional week in fiscal 2011 has been reflected in our fourth quarter. Restructuring Initiatives In fiscal 2011, we launched a restructuring program, designed to improve our cost structure. This program includes actions across all three segments as well as corporate. We expect to incur charges of approximately $275 million under this program as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives are identified and approved, most of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal 2014. Savings from this program are estimated to be $175 million to $225 million on an annualized basis once the program is completed. During fiscal 2011, we incurred $51 million of restructuring and related charges under this program. In fiscal 2009, we launched a $200 million restructuring program designed to improve our cost structure. This program included actions across all three segments as well as corporate. Charges under this program, primarily related to employee severance and benefits, were recorded as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives were identified and approved. During fiscal 2011, we incurred $52 million of restructuring and related charges under this program. As of September 30, 2011, this program was substantially completed. 31 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Research and Development Investment Our research and development expense increased $107 million and $20 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 include $30 million of upfront fees and milestone payments incurred in connection with the PENNSAID&reg; and EXALGO&reg; product license arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. We expect research and development expenditures to continue to increase over the next several years as a result of our internal research and development initiatives. We intend to focus our research and development investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. We are committed to investing in products that have a demonstrable clinical impact and value to the healthcare system and through which we can benefit from our core competencies and global infrastructure. Sales and Marketing Investment Selling and marketing expenses increased $304 million in fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to increased costs resulting from prior year acquisitions and planned increases to support product launches. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase over the next several years as we make investments to drive our future growth, specifically in Asia. Legal Charges During fiscal 2011, we recorded legal charges of $46 million related to our indemnification obligations for certain claims pertaining to all known pending and estimated future pelvic mesh product liability claims, net of insurance recoveries. This amount was partially offset by income of $11 million for the reversal of our portion of the remaining reserves that had been established in fiscal 2009 to settle Tyco International securities cases. During fiscal 2010, we recorded a $33 million charge to settle an antitrust case, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $94 million to settle three antitrust cases, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $183 million for our share of Tyco Internationals settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining Tyco International securities cases outstanding at that time. Currency Exchange Rates Our results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2011 is as follows: U.S. Dollar 57 % Euro 17 Japanese Yen 9 All other 17 100 % 2011 Form 10 K 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal Years Ended 2011, 2010 and 2009 The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales: Fiscal Years (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net sales $ 11,574 100.0 % $ 10,429 100.0 % $ 10,263 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 4,996 43.2 4,624 44.3 4,622 45.0 Gross profit 6,578 56.8 5,805 55.7 5,641 55.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,538 30.6 3,219 30.9 3,042 29.6 Research and development expenses 554 4.8 447 4.3 427 4.2 Restructuring charges, net 122 1.1 76 0.7 61 0.6 Shareholder settlement (income) charges (11 ) (0.1 ) 183 1.8 In process research and development charges 115 1.1 Operating income 2,375 20.5 2,063 19.8 1,813 17.7 Interest expense (203 ) (1.8 ) (199 ) (1.9 ) (175 ) (1.7 ) Interest income 22 0.2 22 0.2 24 0.2 Other income, net 22 0.2 40 0.4 145 1.4 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 2,216 19.1 1,926 18.5 1,807 17.6 Income tax expense 333 2.9 363 3.5 865 8.4 Income from continuing operations 1,883 16.3 1,563 15.0 942 9.2 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (15 ) (0.1 ) 69 0.7 (35 ) (0.3 ) Net income $ 1,868 16.1 $ 1,632 15.6 $ 907 8.8 Net sales Our net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $1.145 billion, or 11.0%, to $11.574 billion, compared with $10.429 billion in fiscal 2010. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a $269 million increase to net sales in fiscal 2011. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by sales growth within our Medical Devices segment, largely attributable to the acquisition of ev3 Inc. In addition, the extra selling week in fiscal 2011 had a favorable impact on our current fiscal years net sales growth. Our net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $166 million, or 1.6%, to $10.429 billion, compared with $10.263 billion in fiscal 2009. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a $198 million increase to net sales in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2009 includes $354 million of sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets sold under a license agreement, which ended during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. The remaining sales increase was driven by sales growth within our Medical Devices segment largely resulting from acquisitions, partially offset by decreased sales within our Pharmaceuticals segments, primarily due to decreased sales of generic pharmaceuticals and the sale of our nuclear pharmacies in the United States. Net sales generated by our businesses in the United States were $6.331 billion, $5.725 billion and $5.925 billion in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our non U.S. businesses generated net sales of $5.243 billion, $4.704 billion and $4.338 billion in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our businesses outside the United States represented approximately 45%, 45% and 42% of our net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower proportion of non U.S. net sales in fiscal 2009, compared with the other two years is largely attributable to the fiscal 2009 sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets in the United States. Our results of operations for fiscal 2011 were not adversely impacted by the natural disasters that occurred in Japan during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Japan represented approximately 9%, 8% and 8% of our net sales during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 33 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Net sales by geographic area are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(1) (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 U.S. $ 6,331 $ 5,725 11 % % 11 % Other Americas 745 653 14 6 8 Europe 2,746 2,605 5 3 2 Asia Pacific 1,752 1,446 21 10 11 $ 11,574 $ 10,429 11 3 8 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(1) (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 5,725 $ 5,925 (3 )% % (3 )% Other Americas 653 549 19 12 7 Europe 2,605 2,510 4 1 3 Asia Pacific 1,446 1,279 13 8 5 $ 10,429 $ 10,263 2 2 (1) Operational growth, a non GAAP financial measure, measures the change in sales between current and prior year periods using a constant currency, the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. We have provided this non GAAP financial measure because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation. This non GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Costs of goods sold Cost of goods sold was 43.2% of net sales for fiscal 2011, compared with 44.3% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of businesses resulting primarily from acquisitions and divestitures in the prior year, as well as manufacturing cost reductions. This decrease was partially offset by increased raw materials prices. Cost of goods sold was 44.3% of net sales for fiscal 2010, compared with 45.0% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to favorable sales mix and increased sales volume in the Medical Devices segment. This decrease was partially offset by the absence of sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets during fiscal 2010, which resulted in an increase of 1.5 percentage points. In addition, cost of goods sold for fiscal 2010 includes a $39 million charge related to the sale of acquired inventory that had been written up to fair value upon the acquisition of ev3, which resulted in an increase of 0.3 percentage points. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 increased $319 million, or 9.9%, to $3.538 billion, compared with $3.219 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 was largely due to increased costs, primarily selling and marketing, resulting from prior year acquisitions within our Medical Devices segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.6% of net sales for fiscal 2011, compared with 30.9% of net sales for fiscal 2010. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales resulted primarily from the extra selling week in fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2010 increased $177 million, or 5.8%, to $3.219 billion, compared with $3.042 billion in fiscal 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.9% of 2011 Form 10 K 34 Table of Contents net sales for fiscal 2010, compared with 29.6% of net sales for fiscal 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased costs resulting from prior year acquisitions and planned increases to support product launches. Research and development expenses Research and development expense increased $107 million to $554 million in fiscal 2011, compared with $447 million in fiscal 2010. The increase primarily resulted from additional spending within our Medical Devices segment, primarily resulting from prior year acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, increased spending within our Pharmaceuticals segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 4.8% for fiscal 2011, compared with 4.3% for fiscal 2010. We plan to increase research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to 5% to 6% over the next several years. Research and development expense increased $20 million to $447 million, in fiscal 2010, compared with $427 million in fiscal 2009. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2009 included $30 million of upfront fees and milestone payments for licensing arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. The remaining $50 million increase, primarily resulted from additional spending within our Medical Devices segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expense was 4.3% for fiscal 2010, compared with and 4.2% for fiscal 2009. Restructuring charges, net During fiscal 2011, we recorded net restructuring and related charges of $131 million, of which $9 million related to accelerated depreciation and was included in cost of goods sold. The remaining $122 million primarily related to severance and employee benefit costs incurred under our 2011 and 2009 programs and the cancellation of distributor and supplier agreements associated with prior year acquisitions by our Medical Devices segment. In addition, during fiscal 2011 we reversed $24 million of restructuring reserves, primarily under our 2009 program, $10 million of which resulted from the determination that one of the restructuring actions within our Medical Supplies segment was no longer cost effective. During fiscal 2010, we recorded net restructuring charges of $76 million primarily related to severance costs within our Medical Supplies and Medical Devices segments. During fiscal 2009, we recorded net restructuring charges of $61 million, comprised of $66 million of charges, partially offset by $5 million of changes in estimates. The $66 million of charges includes asset impairments of $12 million primarily related to the write down of long lived assets of a manufacturing facility within our Pharmaceuticals segment, which has been closed as a result of cost savings initiatives. The remaining charges and changes in estimates primarily relate to severance costs across all segments and corporate. Shareholder settlement (income) charges During fiscal 2009, we recorded charges totaling $183 million for our share of Tyco Internationals settlements of several securities cases and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining Tyco International securities cases outstanding at that time. In fiscal 2011, all of the remaining securities lawsuits were resolved. Accordingly, during fiscal 2011, we recorded income of $11 million related to the reversal of our portion of the remaining reserves that had previously been established. In process research and development charges During fiscal 2009, our Medical Devices segment recorded a charge of $59 million for the write off of in process research and development associated with the acquisition of VNUS. This charge relates to an alternative minimally invasive device for the treatment of varicose veins and venous reflux that VNUS is developing, which has not yet received regulatory approval. As of the date of acquisition, this technology was not considered to be technologically feasible or to have any alternative future use. Design, testing, clinical trials and regulatory submission are required in order to bring the project to completion. If the device receives regulatory approval, we anticipate that it will occur in fiscal 2013 and be released to the market shortly thereafter. Management determined the valuation of the in process research and development using, among other factors, appraisals. The value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method and was discounted at a 31% rate, which was considered commensurate with the projects risks and stage of development. Future residual cash flows that could be generated from the project were determined based upon managements estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the project and technology involved. 35 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents These projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account managements estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the project to completion. While we expect regulatory approval to occur in 2013, we cannot assure that the underlying assumptions used to prepare the discounted cash flow analysis will prove to be accurate or that the timely completion of the project to commercial success will occur. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties associated with research and development projects. In addition to this charge discussed above, during fiscal 2009, our Medical Devices segment recorded charges of $56 million for the write off of in process research and development, of which $36 million was associated with the acquisition of PMI and $20 million with the acquisition of intellectual property. Operating income In fiscal 2011, operating income increased $312 million to $2.375 billion, compared with operating income of $2.063 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales volume within our Medical Devices segment, largely attributable to the prior year acquisition of ev3 and the extra selling week in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 also benefited from the absence of $64 million in charges relating to both acquisition transaction costs and net loss on divestitures incurred in the prior year. These increases in operating income were partially offset by increased costs resulting from acquisitions and $55 million of incremental net restructuring and related charges. In fiscal 2010, operating income increased $250 million to $2.063 billion, compared with operating income of $1.813 billion in fiscal 2009. Operating income for fiscal 2009 included: $345 million related to sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release tablets; $183 million of shareholder settlement charges; $115 million of in process research and development charges; charges totaling $71 million for the estimated additional cost to remediate environmental matters at a site located in Orrington, Maine; and $30 million of upfront fees and milestone payments for licensing arrangements entered into by our Pharmaceuticals segment. The remaining $196 million increase in operating income was primarily due to favorable sales mix and increased sales volume within our Medical Devices segment and a $61 million decrease in legal charges associated with the settlement of antitrust cases, partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions and new product launches. Analysis of Operating Results by Segment Management measures and evaluates our reportable segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non recurring or non operational are excluded from segment net sales and segment operating income because management evaluates the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items include revenues and expenses related to sales of oxycodone hydrochloride extended release (Oxy ER) tablets sold under a license agreement, which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and ended in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, net charges associated with acquisitions, licensing arrangements and divestitures, certain legal and environmental charges, net of insurance recoveries and restructuring and related charges. Although these amounts are excluded from segment net sales and segment operating income, as applicable, they are included in reported consolidated net sales and operating income and accordingly, are included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations. Net sales by segment are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 Medical Devices $ 7,829 $ 6,715 17 % 4 % 13 % Pharmaceuticals 1,967 1,991 (1 ) 2 (3 ) Medical Supplies 1,778 1,723 3 3 Consolidated net sales $ 11,574 $ 10,429 11 3 8 2011 Form 10 K 36 Table of Contents Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Medical Devices $ 6,715 $ 6,061 11 % 3 % 8 % Pharmaceuticals 1,991 2,096 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Medical Supplies 1,723 1,752 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales of reportable segments 10,429 9,909 5 2 3 Sales of Oxy ER 354 (100 ) (100 ) Consolidated net sales $ 10,429 $ 10,263 2 2 Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for each of the last three fiscal years are shown in the following table: Fiscal Years (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 2009 Medical Devices $ 2,422 30.9 % $ 2,097 31.2 % $ 1,849 30.5 % Pharmaceuticals 318 16.2 330 16.6 343 16.4 Medical Supplies 247 13.9 254 14.7 225 12.8 Operating income of reportable segments 2,987 25.8 2,681 25.7 2,417 24.4 Unallocated amounts: Corporate expenses (414 ) (419 ) (392 ) Restructuring and related charges, net (131 ) (76 ) (61 ) Net charges associated with acquisitions, licensing arrangements and divestitures (32 ) (90 ) (166 ) Legal and environmental charges, net of insurance recoveries (35 ) (33 ) (330 ) Impact of Oxy ER 345 Consolidated operating income $ 2,375 $ 2,063 $ 1,813 Medical Devices Net sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 Endomechanical Instruments $ 2,342 $ 2,139 9 % 3 % 6 % Energy Devices 1,170 992 18 3 15 Soft Tissue Repair Products 900 854 5 3 2 Vascular Products 1,426 810 76 3 73 Oximetry & Monitoring Products 853 755 13 2 11 Airway & Ventilation Products 752 770 (2 ) 4 (6 ) Other Products 386 395 (2 ) 6 (8 ) $ 7,829 $ 6,715 17 4 13 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 U.S. $ 3,483 $ 2,839 23 % % 23 % Non U.S. 4,346 3,876 12 6 6 $ 7,829 $ 6,715 17 4 13 37 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $1.114 billion, or 17%, to $7.829 billion, compared with $6.715 billion for fiscal 2010. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted net sales for the segment by $235 million. The remaining increase in net sales for the segment was driven by increased sales of Vascular Products, Energy Devices, Endomechanical Instruments and Oximetry & Monitoring Products. The increase in Vascular Products sales was primarily due to the acquisition of ev3, which resulted in an additional $542 million in net sales for the segment. The increase in net sales for Energy Devices and Endomechanical Instruments resulted primarily from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products and stapling devices, respectively, largely attributable to sales of new products. Finally, the increase in sales for Oximetry & Monitoring Products was driven by higher sales volume of sensors primarily resulting from the prior year acquisition of Somanetics Corporation. These increases in net sales were somewhat offset by a decrease in sales of Airway & Ventilation Products resulting from strong sales in the prior year due to the H1N1 pandemic. Net sales for fiscal 2011 also benefited from the extra selling week in the fourth quarter, which impacted all product groups. Operating income for fiscal 2011 increased $325 million to $2.422 billion, compared with $2.097 billion for fiscal 2010. Our operating margin was 30.9% for fiscal 2011, compared with 31.2% for fiscal 2010. The increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance for the overall segment discussed above, partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions, particularly selling and marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, research and development expenses. Net sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 are as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Endomechanical Instruments $ 2,139 $ 1,982 8 % 3 % 5 % Energy Devices 992 867 14 2 12 Soft Tissue Repair Products 854 807 6 3 3 Vascular Products 810 574 41 3 38 Oximetry & Monitoring Products 755 636 19 2 17 Airway & Ventilation Products 770 763 1 3 (2 ) Other Products 395 432 (9 ) 6 (15 ) $ 6,715 $ 6,061 11 3 8 Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 2,839 $ 2,528 12 % % 12 % Non U.S. 3,876 3,533 10 5 5 $ 6,715 $ 6,061 11 3 8 Net sales for fiscal 2010 increased $654 million to $6.715 billion, compared with $6.061 billion for fiscal 2009. Favorable currency exchange fluctuations positively impacted net sales for the segment by $175 million. The remaining increase in net sales for the segment was driven by increased sales across all major product groups, except Airway & Ventilation Products. The increase in sales for Vascular Products was primarily due to the acquisitions of ev3 and VNUS, which together resulted in an additional $195 million in net sales for the segment. Similarly, the increase in sales for Oximetry & Monitoring Products resulted primarily from the acquisition of Aspect. The increase in Energy Devices net sales resulted primarily from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products, while the increase in sales of Endomechanical Instruments was primarily driven by continued demand for our stapling devices and, to a lesser extent, laparoscopic instruments. Finally, the increase in sales for Soft Tissue Repair Products was primarily attributable to hernia mesh products. These increases were 2011 Form 10 K 38 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in sales of Airway & Ventilation Products, primarily due to the divestiture of the sleep diagnostics and sleep therapy product lines, and a $63 million decrease in sales due to the divestiture of our oxygen therapy product line, included in Other Products. Operating income for fiscal 2010 increased $248 million to $2.097 billion, compared with $1.849 billion for fiscal 2009. Our operating margin was 31.2% for fiscal 2010, compared with 30.5% for fiscal 2009. The increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance for the overall segment discussed above. This increase was partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions, primarily selling, general and administrative expenses and, to a lesser extent, research and development expenses. Pharmaceuticals Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 Specialty Pharmaceuticals $ 494 $ 473 4 % % 4 % Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 416 395 5 1 4 Contrast Products 598 604 (1 ) 2 (3 ) Radiopharmaceuticals 459 519 (12 ) 1 (13 ) $ 1,967 $ 1,991 (1 ) 2 (3 ) Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2011 2010 U.S. $ 1,288 $ 1,372 (6 )% % (6 )% Non U.S. 679 619 10 5 5 $ 1,967 $ 1,991 (1 ) 2 (3 ) Net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased $24 million, or 1%, to $1.967 billion, compared with $1.991 billion for fiscal 2010. This decrease was driven by a decline in Radiopharmaceuticals net sales resulting from the divestiture of our nuclear pharmacies within the United States during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. This decrease was largely offset by increased sales of generic pharmaceuticals, primarily the fentanyl patch and lozenge, and increased sales of acetaminophen within Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. In addition, increased sales of EXALGO&reg; and PENNSAID&reg; were more than offset by the decline in sales of our older branded products due to generic competition. Net sales for fiscal 2011 also benefited from the extra selling week in the fourth quarter, which impacted all product groups. Operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $12 million to $318 million, compared with $330 million for fiscal 2010. Our operating margin was 16.2% for fiscal 2011, compared with 16.6% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased research and development expenses and increased selling and marketing expenses to support our recent product launches, partially offset by decreased legal costs. In addition, the decline in operating income was due to the overall segment sales decline discussed above. 39 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 are as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Specialty Pharmaceuticals $ 473 $ 544 (13 )% % (13 )% Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients 395 405 (2 ) 1 (3 ) Contrast Products 604 591 2 2 Radiopharmaceuticals 519 556 (7 ) (7 ) $ 1,991 $ 2,096 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 1,372 $ 1,509 (9 )% % (9 )% Non U.S. 619 587 5 3 2 $ 1,991 $ 2,096 (5 ) 1 (6 ) Net sales for fiscal 2010 decreased $105 million to $1.991 billion, compared with $2.096 billion for fiscal 2009. The decrease primarily resulted from a decline in Specialty Pharmaceuticals and Radiopharmaceuticals net sales. The decrease in Specialty Pharmaceuticals sales was attributable to a decline in sales of generic pharmaceuticals, primarily hydrocodone and oxycodone, resulting from aggressive price competition and, to a lesser extent, to lower sales of branded pharmaceuticals. The decrease in sales of branded pharmaceuticals was largely due to a decline in sales of Restoril, for which our patent recently expired. This decrease was partially offset by sales of EXALGO&reg; and PENNSAID&reg; products, which were launched in fiscal 2010. The sale of our nuclear pharmacies in the United States also contributed to the decline in net sales for the segment. The decreases discussed above were somewhat offset by favorable currency translation. Operating income for fiscal 2010 decreased $13 million to $330 million, compared with $343 million for fiscal 2009. Our operating margin was 16.6% for fiscal 2010, compared with 16.4% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit resulting from the overall segment sales decline discussed above and increased selling and marketing expenses to support new branded product launches, partially offset by lower legal costs.

The increase in net sales for the segment was primarily driven by increased sales of Medical Surgical Products largely attributable to sales of a new disposable lead wire system. The increase in sales of OEM products was mostly offset by a decline in sales of SharpSafety Products primarily resulting from stronger sales in the comparative prior year period due to the H1N1 flu pandemic. Net sales for fiscal 2011 also benefited from the extra selling week in the fourth quarter, which impacted all product groups. Operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $7 million to $247 million, compared with $254 million for fiscal 2010. Our operating margin was 13.9% for fiscal 2011, compared with 14.7% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating income and margin primarily resulted from increased raw material costs, partially offset by the overall segment sales performance discussed above. Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 are as follows: Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 Nursing Care Products $ 783 $ 790 (1 )% % (1 )% Medical Surgical Products 412 417 (1 ) (1 ) SharpSafety Products 320 334 (4 ) (4 ) Original Equipment Manufacturer Products 208 211 (1 ) 1 (2 ) $ 1,723 $ 1,752 (2 ) (2 ) Fiscal Years PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth (Dollars in Millions) 2010 2009 U.S. $ 1,514 $ 1,534 (1 )% % (1 )% Non U.S. 209 218 (4 ) 1 (5 ) $ 1,723 $ 1,752 (2 ) (2 ) Net sales for fiscal 2010 decreased $29 million to $1.723 billion, compared with $1.752 billion for fiscal 2009. The decrease resulted from lower sales across all product lines, most notably SharpSafety Products. The sales decrease in SharpSafety Products resulted from a decline in both sharps disposal products and needles and syringes due to pricing pressure and the exit of these product lines in Europe in the prior year. The decline in sales of Nursing Care Products was largely driven by decreased sales of traditional wound care products, partially offset by increased sales volume of incontinence products. Operating income for fiscal 2010 increased $29 million to $254 million, compared with $225 million for fiscal 2009. Our operating margin was 14.7% for fiscal 2010, compared with 12.8% for fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income and margin was primarily due to decreased manufacturing costs and lower selling and marketing expenses primarily attributable to savings from restructuring actions. Corporate Corporate expense was $414 million, $419 million and $392 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009. The $27 million increase in corporate expense in fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, resulted primarily from increased compensation costs and, to a lesser extent, increased legal costs, partially offset by decreased finance departmental costs. Non Operating Items Interest Expense and Interest Income During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, interest expense was $203 million, $199 million and $175 million, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we issued $1.5 billion in senior notes to finance a portion 41 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents of the ev3 acquisition, which resulted in an increase in interest expense. However, in fiscal 2011, this increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of interest rate swaps entered into in fiscal 2011, the repayment of our $250 million 5.2% senior notes in October 2010 and the absence of $13 million of fees associated with a bridge financing obtained in fiscal 2010 connection with the acquisition of ev3. The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009, resulted from the $13 million of fees associated with the bridge financing and the issuance of the $1.5 billion in senior notes. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, interest income was $22 million, $22 million and $24 million, respectively. Other Income, net During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded other income, net of $22 million, $40 million and $145 million, respectively. These amounts include income of $29 million, $43 million and $148 million and corresponding increases to our receivable from Tyco International and TE Connectivity, which reflects 58% of interest and other income tax payable recorded during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that will be subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. Income under the Tax Sharing Agreement for fiscal 2009 includes $107 million which represents the effect on our receivable from Tyco International and TE Connectivity of Tyco Internationals settlement of certain outstanding tax matters with the IRS. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense was $333 million, $363 million and $865 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.216 billion, $1.926 billion and $1.807 billion for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 15.0%, 18.8% and 47.9% for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from a favorable settlement reached with certain non U.S. taxing authorities and, to a lesser extent, the release of certain U.S. and non U.S. uncertain tax positions due to statute expirations. In addition, the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the retroactive reenactment of the U.S. research and development tax credit and the implementation of our tax planning strategies. The significant decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010, compared with fiscal 2009 resulted from the release of a significant non U.S. valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 upon finalization of a non U.S. tax planning initiative. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was also due to withholding tax incurred on repatriated earnings in the prior year period. During fiscal 2009, we provided for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and a 5% withholding tax on earnings that were repatriated during that period (i) in connection with a one time transaction that was implemented as part of our tax planning strategies and (ii) in jurisdictions where we were not permanently reinvested. In addition, in fiscal 2009 we incurred charges of $183 million related to our portion of Tyco Internationals shareholder settlements and our portion of the estimated cost to settle all of the remaining securities cases outstanding at that time, for which no tax benefit was recorded. Finally, the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009 also resulted from the implementation of our tax planning strategies and an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions. Discontinued Operations Specialty Chemicals business During fiscal 2010, we sold our Specialty Chemicals business within our Pharmaceuticals segment. We decided to sell this business because its products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. This business met the discontinued operations criteria, and accordingly is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented. 2011 Form 10 K 42 Table of Contents We received net cash proceeds of $273 million and recorded a $20 million pre tax gain on sale. Included within this gain is a $22 million charge associated with an indemnification, which we provided to the purchaser. In addition, we paid $30 million into an escrow account as collateral for this indemnification, which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Additional information regarding this indemnification is discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources Guarantees. Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recorded a $9 million tax provision and a $20 million tax benefit, respectively, in discontinued operations. These amounts resulted from adjustments to certain income tax liabilities associated with the Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses that were sold in fiscal 2006 prior to our separation from Tyco International. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. We believe, however, that our cash balances and other sources of liquidity, primarily our committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Fiscal 2011 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by operating activities of $2.182 billion was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in income taxes payable of $423 million and an increase of inventory of $203 million. During fiscal 2011, we made a net payment of $248 million in connection with the proposed settlements of U.S. tax audits for the years 1997 through 2004 and other non U.S. audits. This amount includes a $404 million advance payment to the IRS for which we were partially reimbursed by Tyco International and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement, as well as, indemnification payments to Tyco International and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters in which they are the primary obligor. In fiscal 2012, we expect to make additional indemnification payments of approximately $100 million to TE Connectivity related to pre separation tax matters under the Tax Sharing Agreement. The net cash used in investing activities of $480 million was primarily due to capital expenditures of $467 million. The net cash used in financing activities of $1.771 billion was primarily the result of shares repurchases of $955 million and dividend payments of $396 million. In addition, we repaid $282 million under our commercial paper program and paid $250 million upon the maturity of our 5.2% senior notes. Fiscal 2010 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by operating activities of $2.185 billion was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes. An increase of income taxes payable of $312 million also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities. These amounts were partially offset by a $200 million decrease in accrued and other current liabilities, driven largely by the payment of prior year legal settlements. The net cash used in investing activities of $3.195 billion was primarily due to acquisition related payments of $3.012 billion, primarily associated with the acquisition of ev3 and capital expenditures of $401 million. These amounts were partially offset by $263 million of net proceeds from divestitures, primarily related to the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business. The net cash provided by financing activities of $1.060 billion was primarily the result of proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1.489 billion and net proceeds from commercial paper of $246 million. These amounts were partially offset by dividend payments of $360 million and share repurchases of $331 million. 43 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Cash Flow Activity The net cash provided by continuing operating activities of $1.829 billion was primarily attributable to net income for fiscal 2009, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, the change in related party receivable on the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in Other Income, net, deferred income taxes and in process research and development charges and an increase in working capital of $394 million driven primarily by accrued and other liabilities and income taxes payable. The increase in accrued and other liabilities includes $72 million related to estimated environmental remediation costs and $58 million relating to an antitrust legal settlement. A majority of the increase in income taxes relates to our portion of Tyco Internationals settlement with the IRS of certain outstanding tax matters within the 2001 through 2004 audit cycle. During fiscal 2009, we paid $151 million for our portion of Tyco Internationals settlements with certain shareholders. In addition, we paid $129 million for U.S. and non U.S. income taxes and withholding tax on earnings that were either repatriated or undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in certain subsidiaries. The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.001 billion was primarily due to acquisition related payments of $608 million, primarily associated with the acquisition of VNUS, and capital expenditures of $384 million. The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $573 million was primarily the result of dividend payments of $322 million and repurchases of shares totaling $232 million discussed under Share Repurchases. Capitalization Shareholders equity was $9.817 billion, or $20.37 per share, at September 30, 2011, compared with $8.974 billion, or $18.13 per share, at September 24, 2010. Net income of $1.868 billion and share options exercised of $187 million, were partially offset by the repurchase of shares of $955 million and dividends declared of $404 million during fiscal 2011. At September 30, 2011, total debt was $4.208 billion and cash was $1.503 billion, compared with total debt of $4.706 billion and cash of $1.565 billion at September 24, 2010. The decrease in our total debt primarily resulted from the partial repayment of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and the repayment of our $250 million 5.2% senior notes upon maturity. Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and shareholders equity) was 30% at September 30, 2011, compared with 34% at September 24, 2010. In August 2011, we replaced our $1.425 billion five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility expiring in 2012, with a $1.500 billion five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility expiring in 2016. We may increase this facility by up to $500 million to a maximum of $2.000 billion provided certain borrowing conditions are met. Borrowings under this credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin dependent on our credit ratings. We are required to pay a facility fee between 7.5 to 25 basis points, depending on our credit rating, on the aggregate unused amount under the facility. The credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreement contains other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. No amount was outstanding under either credit facility at September 30, 2011 or September 24, 2010. We are required to maintain an available unused balance under our $1.500 billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We had $115 million and $397 million of commercial paper outstanding at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. Dividends Dividend payments were $396 million during fiscal 2011. On September 22, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.225 per share to shareholders of record on October 13, 2011. The 2011 Form 10 K 44 Table of Contents dividend, totaling $109 million, was paid on November 4, 2011. We expect that we will continue to pay dividends comparable to this increased amount to holders of our ordinary shares. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares, however, falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant. Share Repurchases During fiscal 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to $300 million of our ordinary shares to partially offset dilution related to equity compensation plans. Shares may be repurchased from time to time, based on market conditions. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 6 million ordinary shares for $225 million under this program. We also repurchase shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares. In addition, we repurchase shares to settle certain option exercises. During fiscal 2009, we spent an additional $7 million to acquire shares in connection with such share based awards. In fiscal 2009, prior to the reorganization discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, we retired the 2.1 million shares that Covidien Ltd. held in treasury. During fiscal 2010, our Board of Directors authorized a program to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our ordinary shares primarily to offset dilution related to equity compensation plans. We completed this share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. In August 2011, our Board of Directors authorized another program to purchase up to $2.0 billion of our ordinary shares to allow management to utilize excess cash to enhance shareholder value. Shares may be repurchased from time to time, based on market conditions. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $325 million under our share buyback programs. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 19 million shares for $950 million under these programs. We spent an additional $6 million and $5 million to acquire shares in connection with share based awards as described above during fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 30, 2011 is presented in the following table. (Dollars in Millions) Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Debt(1) $ 6,414 $ 202 $ 1,186 $ 169 $ 563 $ 266 $ 4,028 Capital lease obligations(1) 61 8 8 8 8 6 23 Operating leases 451 118 88 71 55 43 76 Purchase obligations(2) 171 122 15 11 11 12 Total contractual cash obligations(3) $ 7,097 $ 450 $ 1,297 $ 259 $ 637 $ 327 $ 4,127 (1) Interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2011. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. (3) The table above does not include $1.204 billion of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $500 million of associated accrued interest and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. In addition, this table does not include other liabilities of $1.031 45 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents billion, primarily consisting of liabilities pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, insurable liabilities and deferred compensation, because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain. However, the minimum required contributions to our pension plans are expected to be $36 million in fiscal 2012. We also expect to make contributions of $9 million to our postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2012. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. We believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Further information regarding our legal proceedings is provided in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements and in Item 3 Legal Proceedings. Income Taxes Our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. The IRS continues to examine our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2008 and 2009. Open periods for examination also include certain periods during which we were a subsidiary of Tyco International. The resolution of the matters arising during periods in which we were a Tyco International subsidiary is subject to the conditions set forth in the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. Tyco International has the right to administer, control and settle all U.S. income tax audits for periods prior to the separation. We have potential liabilities related to these income tax returns and have included our best estimate of potential liabilities for these years within our current and non current taxes payable. With respect to these potential income tax liabilities from all of these years, we believe that the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements as current or non current taxes payable are adequate. In accordance with the Tax Sharing Agreement, we share certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved tax matters of Tyco International for periods prior to the separation, with Covidien assuming 42%, Tyco International 27% and TE Connectivity 31% of the total amount. We are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $1.631 billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011, $1.067 billion of which relates to periods prior to the separation and which is shared with Tyco International and TE Connectivity pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. The actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, some of which may not be resolved for several years. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we have recorded a receivable from Tyco International and TE Connectivity of $587 million as of September 30, 2011, substantially all of which is non current. This amount primarily reflects 58% of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and TE Connectivity default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities. During fiscal 2011, we received reimbursement payments totaling $211 million from Tyco International and TE Connectivity. The IRS has concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco Internationals U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and proposed tax adjustments, several of which also affect our income tax returns for years after 2000. Tyco International has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the IRS and we believe that some of these adjustments relating to certain Tyco International subsidiaries are likely to be resolved within the next 12 months. With respect to other adjustments, Tyco International has indicated that settlement is unlikely. In the event that Tyco International is unable to resolve these issues in the IRS 2011 Form 10 K 46 Table of Contents administrative process, Tyco International will likely contest certain adjustments related to disallowed deductions through litigation. While we believe that the amounts recorded as non current taxes payable or guaranteed contingent tax liabilities related to these adjustments are adequate, the timing and outcome of such litigation is highly uncertain and could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. The IRS continues to audit certain of Tyco Internationals U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 and the 2005 through 2007 audit cycles. Tyco International and the IRS have entered into settlements related to certain outstanding tax matters arising in these audit cycles, which otherwise remain open and subject to examination and resolution of other matters. During fiscal 2011, we made a $404 million advance payment to the IRS in connection with the proposed settlement of certain tax matters arising from the 1997 through 2000 and 2001 through 2004 U.S. audit cycles. The resolution of tax matters arising from the 1997 through 2007 U.S. audits, non U.S. audits, and other settlements or statute of limitations expirations, could result in a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits. However, we do not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change over the next twelve months. Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and TE Connectivity. These guarantee arrangements and indemnifications primarily relate to certain contingent tax liabilities; we assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Regarding the guarantees, if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation. These arrangements were valued upon our separation from Tyco International using appraisals and a liability related to these guarantees was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the offset of which was reflected as a reduction in shareholders equity. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the Agreements. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liability to the amount of such potential loss. This guarantee is not amortized because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations under the Agreements, which may not occur for some years. In addition, as payments are made to indemnified parties, such payments are recorded as reductions to the liability and the impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability. A liability of $660 million and $716 million relating to these guarantees was included on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively. During fiscal 2011, we made payments totaling $55 million to Tyco International and TE Connectivity, which represents the 42% reimbursement required pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement for applicable tax and interest payments made by Tyco International and TE Connectivity. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. Except as discussed below, we generally do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In connection with the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business, we provided the purchaser with an indemnification for various risks, including environmental, health, safety, tax and other matters, some of which have an indefinite term. However, the most significant portion of this indemnification relates to environmental, 47 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents health and safety matters, which has a term of 17 years. A liability of $22 million relating to this indemnification was included on our consolidated balance sheet as of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010. The value of the environmental, health and safety guarantee was measured based on the probability weighted present value of the costs expected to be incurred to address environmental claims proposed under the indemnity. The maximum future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification provided to the purchaser is $82 million. In addition, we were required to pay $30 million into an escrow account as collateral, which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities, which are discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are liable for product performance; however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. At September 30, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $276 million. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable. We invest our excess cash in deposits or money market funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions that have at least an A credit rating. Counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least an A/A2 long term debt rating. While we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments, we minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions and actively monitoring outstanding positions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. A portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the United States, however, include sales to government owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries national economies. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of Western Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy and Portugal, may continue to increase the average length of time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable in certain regions within these countries. We have not incurred significant losses on government receivables; however, during fiscal 2010, as a result of the Greek governments plan to repay certain of its past due receivables through the issuance of non interest bearing bonds, we recorded a $19 million charge to write down certain of our accounts receivable in Greece. In fiscal 2011, we received $98 million in non interest bearing bonds from the Greek government. We sold substantially all of these bonds for proceeds of $71 million during fiscal 2011. As a result of the sale, we recorded a $4 million gain, net of the $29 million of reserves that had previously been established on the related receivables. As of September 30, 2011, we had an insignificant amount of these government bonds remaining on our consolidated balance sheet. We continually evaluate all government receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of customers or the countries healthcare systems continue to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain, additional allowances may be required in future periods. Our aggregate accounts receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts in Spain, Italy and Portugal and as a percent of our total outstanding accounts receivable, net are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) September 30,2011 September 24,2010 September 25,2009 Total outstanding accounts receivable, net $ 563 $ 457 $ 435 Percentage of total outstanding accounts receivable, net 32% 27% 26% 2011 Form 10 K 48 Table of Contents Net sales to customers in Spain, Italy and Portugal totaled $732 million, $690 million and $677 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non U.S. jurisdictions. We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analyses. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to $3.409 billion, $3.149 billion, and $2.831 billion, respectively. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include intellectual property consisting primarily of patents, trademarks, unpatented technology and customer lists. We record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years. We evaluate the remaining useful life of intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining useful life. If the estimate of an intangible assets remaining useful life is changed, we amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, which are comprised primarily of certain trademarks, are tested for impairment in the same manner as goodwill. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment in the same manner as property, plant and equipment discussed above. Goodwill In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods. We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We utilize a two step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of 49 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents these units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation, using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Contingencies We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in note 21 to our consolidated financial statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount. We record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. For our U.S. plans, we use a broad population of Moodys AA rated corporate bonds to determine the discount rate assumption. All bonds are non callable, denominated in U.S. Dollars and have a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. This population of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve, to discount the projected benefit payments for the U.S. plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. For our non U.S. plans, the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately $62 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $4 million. Guarantees Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and TE Connectivity. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable as a result of our commitments under the Agreements. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, an adjustment will be required to increase the recorded liability to the amount of such potential loss. This guarantee has not been amortized into income to date because no predictable pattern of performance currently exists. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations 2011 Form 10 K 50 Table of Contents under the Agreements, which may not occur for some years, or, as payments are made to indemnified parties. The impact of such payments is considered in the periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability. In addition, we have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these guarantees relates to an indemnification, which we provided to the purchaser of our Specialty Chemicals business, primarily related to environmental, health, safety, tax and other matters. As of both September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, we have a liability of $22 million on our consolidated balance sheet related to this indemnification; however, we could be required to make payments of up to $82 million. We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability is established. We adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. A significant portion of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes, however, which would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We have recorded significant valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions that we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $6.060 billion and $5.904 billion at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Included in the valuation allowance at September 30, 2011 and September 24, 2010 is $5.7 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively, which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non U.S. net operating losses recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling. It is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income, including any future restructuring activities, may require that we record an additional 51 2011 Form 10 K Table of Contents valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated the accounting guidance related to fair value measurements. These amendments result in convergence of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. We are required to comply with this amendment beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In June 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to the disclosure requirements for presentation of comprehensive income. Under this amendment, we can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. We are required to comply with this new disclosure requirement beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to goodwill impairment testing. This amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. We are required to comply with this amendment beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements. The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material adverse effect on our business. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts. 2011 Form 10 K 52 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exposures Foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts outstanding at September 30, 2011, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the September 30, 2011 market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by $44 million, while a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by $54 million. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. Interest Rate Exposures We manage interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swap transactions with financial institutions acting as principal counterparties to convert a portion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. These transactions are designated as fair value hedges. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into interest rate swaps on $300 million principal amount of our 6.0% senior notes due 2017, which were subsequently terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Since the interest rate swaps were designated as hedging instruments of outstanding debt, the $23 million gain is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt.
