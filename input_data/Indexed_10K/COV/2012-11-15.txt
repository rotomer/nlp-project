Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report. The following discussion may contain forward looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed under the headings Risk Factors and Forward Looking Statements.OverviewWe develop, manufacture and sell healthcare products for use in clinical and home settings. Our mission is to create and deliver innovative healthcare solutions, developed in ethical collaboration with medical professionals, which enhance the quality of life for patients and improve outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. Our three reportable segments are as follows:Medical Devices includes the development, manufacture and sale of endomechanical instruments, energy devices, soft tissue repair products, vascular products, oximetry and monitoring products, airway and ventilation products and other medical products.Pharmaceuticals includes the development, manufacture and distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals, active pharmaceutical ingredients, contrast products and radiopharmaceuticals.Medical Supplies includes the development, manufacture and sale of nursing care products, medical surgical products, SharpSafety products and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products.Effective June 29, 2007, Covidien became the parent company owning the former healthcare businesses of Tyco International Ltd. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares, as well as the shares of its former electronics businesses (TE Connectivity Ltd.), to Tyco International shareholders.Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Separation of Our Pharmaceuticals BusinessIn December 2011, we announced a plan to spin off our pharmaceuticals business into a stand alone public company. We anticipate that the transaction will be in the form of a distribution that will be tax free to U.S. shareholders of a new publicly traded stock in the new pharmaceuticals company. Completion of the transaction is expected to be subject to certain conditions, including, among others, receipt of regulatory approvals, assurance as to the tax free status of the spin off of the pharmaceuticals business to our U.S. shareholders, the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and final approval by our Board of Directors. We currently expect to complete the transaction in June 2013; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed transaction or that the transaction will be completed. Subsequent to the separation, the historical results of our Pharmaceuticals segment will be presented as discontinued operations.Healthcare ReformIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. This legislation includes a provision that imposes a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of such devices in the United States starting after December 31, 2012. The legislation also includes a $28 billion fee on the branded pharmaceutical industry over nine years starting in 2011 and a $2.8 billion annual fee on branded pharmaceuticals thereafter. The amount of branded pharmaceutical fee payable by each company is based upon market share. Since our branded pharmaceutical sales currently represent a small portion of the total market, this annual assessment has not had a significant impact on our results of operations. We estimate that the medical devices tax, however, will increase our selling, general and administrative expenses by between $75 and $100 million annually, beginning in our second quarter of fiscal 2013.Strategic Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements and DivestituresWe regularly engage in strategic reviews of our businesses to improve operations, financial returns and alignment between our businesses and our strategy. We have made strategic acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we will continue to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses, including licensing and distribution transactions and selective acquisitions, as well as divestitures of non strategic and or underperforming businesses.24Table of ContentsAcquisitionsIn October 2012, our Pharmaceuticals segment acquired CNS Therapeutics, Inc., a pharmaceuticals company focused on developing and commercializing products for site specific administration to the central nervous system to treat neurological disorders and chronic pain, for approximately $100 million. The acquisition of CNS Therapeutics complements and expands our branded pharmaceuticals portfolio.During fiscal 2012, our Medical Devices segment acquired the following companies:MindFrame, Inc.a designer and manufacturer of devices designed to optimize rapid perfusion and clot removal in the treatment of patients suffering from ischemic stroke, for total consideration of $72 million, comprised of $70 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $2 million of debt assumed, which we subsequently repaid;Oridion Systems Ltd. (Oridion)a developer of patient monitoring systems, for $327 million in cash (net of cash acquired); superDimension, Ltd.a developer of minimally invasive interventional pulmonology devices, for total consideration of $286 million, comprised of: $243 million in cash (net of cash acquired); $21 million of debt assumed, which we subsequently repaid; and the fair value of contingent consideration of $22 million. The contingent consideration, which could total $50 million, consists of milestone payments related to the achievement of sales targets. Newport Medical Instruments, Inc.a designer and manufacturer of ventilators, for total consideration of $101 million, comprised of $92 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $9 million of debt assumed, which we subsequently repaid; Maya Medicala developer of a treatment for hypertension, for total consideration of $106 million, comprised of: $49 million in cash; $10 million of debt assumed, which we subsequently repaid; and the fair value of contingent consideration of $47 million. The contingent consideration, which could total a maximum of $170 million, consists of $70 million in milestone payments related to the commercialization of a radiofrequency energy based renal denervation device and $100 million in milestone payments related to a device that delivers a chemical agent to cause renal denervation. BRRX Medical, Inc. (BRRX)a developer of bipolar radiofrequency ablation devices used in the treatment of Barretts esophagus syndrome, for total consideration of $393 million, comprised of $322 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and the fair value of contingent consideration of $71 million. During fiscal 2012, we recorded an additional $4 million of contingent consideration upon the achievement of health insurance coverage targets for procedures utilizing BRRX devices. We paid $50 million of this contingent consideration during fiscal 2012.During fiscal 2010, our Medical Devices segment acquired the following companies:ev3 Inc.a developer of technologies for the endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular and neurovascular diseases, for approximately $2.5 billion in cash (net of cash acquired); Somanetics Corporationa developer of cerebral and somatic oximetry and monitoring systems, for $291 million in cash (net of cash acquired); andAspect Medical Systems, Inc. (Aspect)a provider of brain monitoring technology, for total consideration of $208 million, comprised of $150 million in cash (net of cash acquired) and $58 million of debt assumed, which we subsequently repaid.License AgreementDuring fiscal 2012, our Medical Devices segment entered into an exclusive licensing agreement which grants us product rights for two medical device patent and product candidates that are designed to remove peripheral artery blockages. This licensing arrangement included an upfront cash payment of $12 million, which was included in research and development expenses. In addition, during fiscal 2012, we made regulatory related milestone payments of $15 million, which were capitalized as an intangible asset. We may also be required to make additional payments of up to $50 million if certain regulatory and sales milestones are achieved.25Table of ContentsDivestituresDuring fiscal 2010, we sold our sleep and oxygen therapy product lines, both of which were formerly included within our Medical Devices segment. In addition, in fiscal 2010, we sold our nuclear pharmacies in the United States, which was formerly included in our Pharmaceuticals segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 includes a net loss on divestitures of $25 million, primarily related to the sale of our sleep therapy product line. During fiscal 2010, we also sold our Specialty Chemicals, which was formerly included in our Pharmaceuticals segment. This business met the criteria of a discontinued operation and, accordingly has been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. See Discontinued Operations for further information.Covidien Business Factors Influencing the Results of OperationsFiscal YearWe report our results based on a 52 53 week year ending on the last Friday of September. Fiscal 2012 and 2010 consisted of 52 weeks and ended on September 28, 2012 and September 24, 2010, respectively. Fiscal 2011 ended on September 30, 2011 and consisted of 53 weeks. The additional week in fiscal 2011 has been reflected in our fourth quarter.Sales and Marketing InvestmentSelling and marketing expenses increased $57 million and $304 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2012 resulted largely from sales force expansion, primarily in the emerging markets, and increased costs resulting from current year acquisitions. The increase in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increased costs resulting from acquisitions that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and planned increases to support product launches. We expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase over the next several years as we make investments to drive our future growth, specifically in Asia.Separation and Acquisition Transaction Costs During fiscal 2012, we incurred $36 million in costs related to the separation of our Pharmaceuticals segment. These costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily relate to professional fees and duplicative costs incurred to build out the corporate infrastructure of the pharmaceuticals company. We expect to continue to incur costs related to the separation in fiscal 2013. In addition, during fiscal 2012, we incurred net transaction costs associated with acquisitions of $31 million. These costs consist of $20 million of charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses and $17 million of charges in cost of goods sold related to the sale of acquired inventory that had been written up to fair value upon acquisition, partially offset by a $6 million gain on the sale of our non controlling interest in superDimension, which is included in other income, net. During fiscal 2011, we incurred $32 million of charges related to the sale of acquired inventory that had been written up to fair value upon acquisition, which was included in cost of goods sold. During fiscal 2010, we incurred $91 million of costs associated with acquisitions. These costs consisted of $39 million of charges in cost of goods sold related to the sale of acquired inventory that had been written up to fair value upon acquisition, $39 million of charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses and $13 million of financing fees included in interest expense. Research and Development InvestmentOur research and development expense increased $69 million and $107 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2012 primarily resulted from current year acquisitions, increased spending to support our growth initiatives and entering into the license agreement discussed above. The increase in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to additional spending resulting from acquisitions that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect research and development expenditures to continue to increase over the next several years as a result of our internal research and development initiatives. We intend to focus our research and development investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. We are committed to investing in products that have a demonstrable clinical impact and value to the healthcare system and through which we can benefit from our core competencies and global infrastructure.Restructuring InitiativesIn fiscal 2011, we launched a restructuring program, designed to improve our cost structure. This program includes actions across all three segments as well as corporate. We expect to incur charges of approximately $275 million under this program as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives are identified and approved, most of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal 2014. Savings from this program are estimated to be $175 million to $225 million on an annualized basis once the program is completed. As of September 28, 2012, we had incurred $135 million of net restructuring 26Table of Contentsand related charges under this program since its inception. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded net restructuring and related charges associated with all restructuring programs and acquisitions totaling $104 million, $131 million and $76 million, respectively.Legal ChargesDuring fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recorded legal charges of $49 million and $46 million, respectively, related to our indemnification obligations for certain claims pertaining to all known pending and estimated future pelvic mesh product liability claims, net of insurance recoveries. The amount recorded in fiscal 2011 was partially offset by income of $11 million for the reversal of our portion of the remaining reserves that had been established in fiscal 2009 to settle Tyco International securities cases. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we recorded a $33 million charge to settle an antitrust case. These amounts were all included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income.Product Recalls and DiscontinuanceDuring fiscal 2012, net sales of our Duet TRSTM Universal Straight and Articulating Single Use Loading Units (Duet) declined approximately $85 million primarily as a result of recalls. These recalls also led to the discontinuance of the product, which resulted in $18 million of inventory and capital equipment impairments.Currency Exchange RatesOur results of operations are influenced by changes in the currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales by major currencies for fiscal 2012 is as follows:U.S. dollar58%Euro15Japanese yen9All other18 100% 27Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFiscal Years Ended 2012, 2011 and 2010The following table presents results of operations, including percentage of net sales: Fiscal Year(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 2010Net sales$11,852100.0 % $11,574100.0 % $10,429100.0 %Cost of goods sold5,03842.5 4,99643.2 4,62444.3Gross profit6,81457.5 6,57856.8 5,80555.7Selling, general and administrative expenses3,68631.1 3,52730.5 3,21930.9Research and development expenses6235.3 5544.8 4474.3Restructuring charges, net910.8 1221.1 760.7Operating income2,41420.4 2,37520.5 2,06319.8Interest expense(206)(1.7) (203)(1.8) (199)(1.9)Interest income160.1 220.2 220.2Other income, net250.2 220.2 400.4Income from continuing operations before income taxes2,24919.0 2,21619.1 1,92618.5Income tax expense3472.9 3332.9 3633.5Income from continuing operations1,90216.0 1,88316.3 1,56315.0Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax3 (15)(0.1) 690.7Net income$1,90516.1 $1,86816.1 $1,63215.6Net salesOur net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $278 million, or 2.4%, to $11.852 billion, compared with $11.574 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase in net sales was driven by sales growth within our Medical Devices segment, partially offset by unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations of $196 million. In addition, the extra selling week in fiscal 2011 had an unfavorable impact on our current fiscal years net sales growth. Our net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $1.145 billion, or 11.0%, to $11.574 billion, compared with $10.429 billion in fiscal 2010. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a $269 million increase to net sales in fiscal 2011. The remaining increase in net sales was driven by sales growth within our Medical Devices segment, largely attributable to the acquisition of ev3 Inc. In addition, the extra selling week in fiscal 2011 had a favorable impact on our fiscal 2011 net sales growth. Additional information regarding our increases in net sales is provided in "Analysis of Operating Results by Segment."Net sales generated by our businesses in the United States were $6.572 billion, $6.331 billion and $5.725 billion in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our non U.S. businesses generated net sales of $5.280 billion, $5.243 billion and $4.704 billion in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our businesses outside the United States represented approximately 45% of our net sales in each of fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. 28Table of ContentsNet sales by geographic area are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(2)(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 U.S.$6,572 $6,331 4 % % 4%Other Americas725 745 (3) (6) 3Europe2,637 2,746 (4) (7) 3Asia Pacific1,918 1,752 9 1 8Net Sales(1)$11,852 $11,574 2 (2) 4 Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(2)(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 U.S.$6,331 $5,725 11% % 11%Other Americas745 653 14 6 8Europe2,746 2,605 5 3 2Asia Pacific1,752 1,446 21 10 11Net Sales(1)$11,574 $10,429 11 3 8 (1) Sales to external customers are reflected in the regions based on the reporting entity that records the transaction. U.S. sales include sales of neurovascular and peripheral products exported to customers outside the United States and invoiced in multiple currencies of approximately $302 million, $281 million and $206 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accordingly, these U.S. sales are subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.(2) Operational growth, a non GAAP financial measure, measures the change in sales between current and prior year periods using a constant currency, the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior year period. We have provided this non GAAP financial measure because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation. This non GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.Cost of goods soldCost of goods sold was 42.5% of net sales in fiscal 2012, compared with 43.2% of net sales in fiscal 2011. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of businesses and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing cost reductions.Cost of goods sold was 43.2% of net sales in fiscal 2011, compared with 44.3% of net sales in fiscal 2010. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of businesses resulting from fiscal 2010 acquisitions and divestitures, as well as, manufacturing cost reductions. These decreases were partially offset by increased raw materials prices.Selling, general and administrative expensesSelling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 increased $159 million, or 4.5%, to $3.686 billion, compared with $3.527 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses resulting from sales force expansion, primarily in the emerging markets, and acquisitions. Separation and transaction costs totaling $56 million in fiscal 2012 also contributed to the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as a result of our recent acquisitions, planned sales and marketing investments to drive our future growth, and the medical device excise tax, which becomes effective in January 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.1% of net sales for fiscal 2012, compared with 30.5% of net sales for fiscal 2011. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales primarily resulted from the extra selling week in fiscal 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 increased $308 million, or 9.6%, to $3.527 billion, compared with $3.219 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 was largely due to increased costs, primarily selling and marketing, resulting from prior year acquisitions within our Medical Devices segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.5% of net sales for fiscal 2011, compared with 30.9% of net sales for 29Table of Contentsfiscal 2010. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales primarily resulted from the extra selling week in fiscal 2011.Research and development expensesResearch and development expenses increased $69 million, or 12.5%, to $623 million in fiscal 2012, compared with $554 million in fiscal 2011. The increase primarily resulted from increased spending within our Medical Devices segment resulting from current year acquisitions and investments made to support our growth initiatives. In addition, fiscal 2012 includes a $12 million upfront payment made in connection with a license agreement entered into by our Medical Devices segment. During fiscal 2012, we achieved our goal of increasing research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales to within the range of 5% to 6%. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 5.3% for fiscal 2012, compared with 4.8% for fiscal 2011. Research and development expenses increased $107 million, or 23.9%, to $554 million in fiscal 2011, compared with $447 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to additional spending within our Medical Devices segment, largely resulting from acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and, to a lesser extent, increased spending within our Pharmaceuticals segment. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses were 4.8% for fiscal 2011, compared with 4.3% for fiscal 2010. Restructuring charges, netDuring fiscal 2012, we recorded net restructuring and related charges of $104 million, of which charges of $13 million related to accelerated depreciation and were included in cost of goods sold. The remaining $91 million primarily related to severance and employee benefit costs incurred under our 2011 program. During fiscal 2011, we recorded net restructuring and related charges of $131 million, of which $9 million related to accelerated depreciation and was included in cost of goods sold. The remaining $122 million primarily related to severance and employee benefit costs incurred under our 2011 and 2009 programs and the cancellation of distributor and supplier agreements associated with prior year acquisitions by our Medical Devices segment. In addition, during fiscal 2011 we reversed $24 million of restructuring reserves, primarily under our 2009 program, $10 million of which resulted from the determination that one of the restructuring actions within our Medical Supplies segment was no longer cost effective.During fiscal 2010, we recorded net restructuring charges of $76 million primarily related to severance costs within our Medical Supplies and Medical Devices segments. Operating incomeIn fiscal 2012, operating income increased $39 million to $2.414 billion, compared with operating income of $2.375 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the gross profit resulting from increased sales volume within our Medical Devices segment. This increase was partially offset by a $69 million increase in research and development expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses, primarily resulting from sales force expansion and acquisitions within our Medical Devices segment, and an increase in separation and transaction costs.In fiscal 2011, operating income increased $312 million to $2.375 billion, compared with operating income of $2.063 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased sales volume within our Medical Devices segment, largely attributable to the prior year acquisition of ev3 and the extra selling week in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 also benefited from the absence of $64 million in charges relating to both acquisition transaction costs and net loss on divestitures incurred in fiscal 2010. These increases in operating income were partially offset by increased costs resulting from acquisitions and $55 million of incremental net restructuring and related charges.Analysis of Operating Results by SegmentManagement measures and evaluates our reportable segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non recurring or non operational are excluded from segment operating income because management evaluates the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items include restructuring and related charges; net charges associated with acquisitions, licensing arrangements and divestitures; separation costs; certain legal charges, net of insurance recoveries; and certain asset impairment charges. Although these amounts are excluded from segment operating income, they are included in reported consolidated operating income and accordingly, are included in our discussion of our consolidated results of operations.30Table of ContentsNet sales by segment are shown in the following tables: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 Medical Devices$8,111 $7,829 4 % (2)% 6 %Pharmaceuticals2,001 1,967 2 (1) 3Medical Supplies1,740 1,778 (2) (1) (1)$11,852 $11,574 2 (2) 4 Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 Medical Devices$7,829 $6,715 17 % 4% 13 %Pharmaceuticals1,967 1,991 (1) 2 (3)Medical Supplies1,778 1,723 3 3 $11,574 $10,429 11 3 8Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales are shown in the following table: Fiscal Year(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 2010Medical Devices$2,49930.8% $2,42230.9% $2,09731.2%Pharmaceuticals33716.8 31816.2 33016.6Medical Supplies21412.3 24713.9 25414.7Operating income of reportable segments3,05025.7 2,98725.8 2,68125.7Unallocated amounts: Corporate expenses(382) (414) (419) Restructuring and related charges, net(104) (131) (76) Net charges associated with acquisitions, licensing arrangements and divestitures(49) (32) (90) Separation costs(36) Legal charges, net of insurance recoveries and shareholder settlement income(47) (35) (33) Impairments related to product discontinuance(18) Consolidated operating income$2,414 $2,375 $2,063 31Table of ContentsMedical DevicesNet sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 are as follows: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 Endomechanical Instruments$2,336 $2,342 % (2)% 2 %Energy Devices1,305 1,170 12 (2) 14Soft Tissue Repair Products882 900 (2) (3) 1Vascular Products1,602 1,426 12 (1) 13Oximetry & Monitoring Products867 853 2 (1) 3Airway & Ventilation Products743 752 (1) (2) 1Other Products376 386 (3) (1) (2) $8,111 $7,829 4 (2) 6 Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 U.S.$3,683 $3,483 6% % 6%Non U.S.4,428 4,346 2 (3) 5 $8,111 $7,829 4 (2) 6 Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $282 million, or 4%, to $8.111 billion, compared with $7.829 billion for fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 acquisitions contributed $79 million to the increase. The remaining increase in net sales for the segment was driven by Vascular Products and Energy Devices. The increase in sales for Vascular Products was primarily due to increased sales of neurovascular products and, to a much lesser extent, peripheral vascular and chronic venous insufficiency products. The increase in Energy Devices sales primarily resulted from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products, most notably in the United States. Increased sales of stapling devices within Endomechanical Instruments driven by growth for our Tri StapleTM product were more than offset by the recall and discontinuance of our Duet product and decreased sales of surgical instruments. Fiscal 2012 net sales for the segment were also negatively impacted by the extra selling week in the prior year and a $152 million unfavorable impact of currency exchange fluctuations. Operating income for fiscal 2012 increased $77 million to $2.499 billion, compared with $2.422 billion for fiscal 2011. Our operating margin was 30.8% for fiscal 2012, compared with 30.9% for fiscal 2011. The increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance for the overall segment discussed above. This increase to operating income was partially offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses, primarily resulting from sales force expansion in the emerging markets and acquisitions, and an increase in research and development expenses to support our growth initiatives.Net sales for Medical Devices by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 Endomechanical Instruments$2,342 $2,139 9 % 3% 6 %Energy Devices1,170 992 18 3 15Soft Tissue Repair Products900 854 5 3 2Vascular Products1,426 810 76 3 73Oximetry & Monitoring Products853 755 13 2 11Airway & Ventilation Products752 770 (2) 4 (6)Other Products386 395 (2) 6 (8) $7,829 $6,715 17 4 1332Table of Contents Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 U.S.$3,483 $2,839 23% % 23%Non U.S.4,346 3,876 12 6 6 $7,829 $6,715 17 4 13Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $1.114 billion, or 17%, to $7.829 billion, compared with $6.715 billion for fiscal 2010. Favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted net sales for the segment by $235 million. The remaining increase in net sales for the segment was driven by increased sales of Vascular Products, Energy Devices, Endomechanical Instruments and Oximetry & Monitoring Products. The increase in Vascular Products sales was primarily due to the acquisition of ev3, which resulted in an additional $542 million in net sales for the segment. The increase in net sales for Energy Devices and Endomechanical Instruments primarily resulted from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products and stapling devices, respectively, largely attributable to sales of new products. Finally, the increase in sales for Oximetry & Monitoring Products was driven by higher sales volume of sensors primarily resulting from the prior year acquisition of Somanetics Corporation. These increases in net sales were somewhat offset by a decrease in sales of Airway & Ventilation Products resulting from strong sales in the prior year due to the H1N1 pandemic. Net sales for fiscal 2011 also benefited from the extra selling week in the fourth quarter, which impacted all product groups.Operating income for fiscal 2011 increased $325 million to $2.422 billion, compared with $2.097 billion for fiscal 2010. Our operating margin was 30.9% for fiscal 2011, compared with 31.2% for fiscal 2010. The increase in our operating income was primarily attributable to increased gross profit on the favorable sales performance for the overall segment discussed above, partially offset by increased costs related to acquisitions, particularly selling and marketing expenses and, to a lesser extent, research and development expenses.PharmaceuticalsNet sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 are as follows: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 Specialty Pharmaceuticals$573 $494 16 % % 16 %Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients433 416 4 (1) 5Contrast Products542 598 (9) (3) (6)Radiopharmaceuticals453 459 (1) (2) 1 $2,001 $1,967 2 (1) 3 Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 U.S.$1,346 $1,288 5 % % 5%Non U.S.655 679 (4) (5) 1 $2,001 $1,967 2 (1) 3Net sales for fiscal 2012 increased $34 million, or 2%, to $2.001 billion, compared with $1.967 billion for fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily driven by increased sales of our EXALGO and PENNSAID branded products within Specialty Pharmaceuticals, higher sales of our generic fentanyl patch within Specialty Pharmaceuticals and higher narcotics sales within Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales of Contrast Products, primarily resulting from lower sales of our Optiray contrast agent, the extra selling week in the prior year, unfavorable currency exchange fluctuations of $31 million and, to a lesser extent, decreased sales of oxycodone products within Specialty Pharmaceuticals. Operating income for fiscal 2012 increased $19 million to $337 million, compared with $318 million for fiscal 2011. Our operating margin was 16.8% for fiscal 2012, compared with 16.2% for fiscal 2011. The increase in operating income and 33Table of Contentsmargin was primarily due to favorable product mix resulting from increased sales of our higher margin branded products and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing. These increases to operating income were partially offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, primarily resulting from higher legal and benefit costs. Net sales for Pharmaceuticals by groups of products and by geography for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 Specialty Pharmaceuticals$494 $473 4 % % 4 %Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients416 395 5 1 4Contrast Products598 604 (1) 2 (3)Radiopharmaceuticals459 519 (12) 1 (13) $1,967 $1,991 (1) 2 (3) Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 U.S.$1,288 $1,372 (6)% % (6)%Non U.S.679 619 10 5 5 $1,967 $1,991 (1) 2 (3)Net sales for fiscal 2011 decreased $24 million, or 1%, to $1.967 billion, compared with $1.991 billion for fiscal 2010. This decrease was driven by a decline in Radiopharmaceuticals net sales resulting from the divestiture of our nuclear pharmacies within the United States during the third quarter of fiscal 2010. This decrease was largely offset by increased sales of generic pharmaceuticals, primarily the fentanyl patch and lozenge, and increased sales of acetaminophen within Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. In addition, increased sales of EXALGO and PENNSAID were more than offset by the decline in sales of our older branded products due to generic competition. Net sales for fiscal 2011 also benefited from the extra selling week in the fourth quarter, which impacted all product groups.Operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $12 million to $318 million, compared with $330 million for fiscal 2010. Our operating margin was 16.2% for fiscal 2011, compared with 16.6% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to increased research and development expenses and increased selling and marketing expenses to support our recent product launches, partially offset by decreased legal costs. In addition, the decline in operating income was due to the overall segment sales decline discussed above. Medical SuppliesNet sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 are as follows: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 Nursing Care Products$806 $808 % (1)% 1 %Medical Surgical Products437 441 (1) (2) 1SharpSafety Products288 308 (6) 1 (7)Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Products209 221 (5) (5) $1,740 $1,778 (2) (1) (1) Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 U.S.$1,543 $1,560 (1)% % (1)%Non U.S.197 218 (10) (7) (3) $1,740 $1,778 (2) (1) (1)34Table of Contents Net sales for fiscal 2012 decreased $38 million to $1.740 billion, compared with $1.778 billion for fiscal 2011. The decrease in net sales for the segment was primarily driven by the extra selling week in the prior year, as well as, a decline in sales of SharpSafety Products resulting from lower sales of sharps disposals, needles and syringes. The decrease in sales of OEM products and woundcare products within Nursing Care also contributed to the overall decline. These decreases in net sales were partially offset by increased sales of incontinence and enteral feeding products within Nursing Care and higher sales of electrodes within Medical Surgical Products. Operating income for fiscal 2012 decreased $33 million to $214 million, compared with $247 million for fiscal 2011. Our operating margin was 12.3% for fiscal 2012, compared with 13.9% for fiscal 2011. The decrease in operating income and margin primarily resulted from pricing pressure and, to a much lesser extent, increased freight costs. The decrease in operating income was also attributable to increases in general and administrative expenses, primarily resulting from higher benefit costs.Net sales for Medical Supplies by groups of products for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 are as follows: Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 Nursing Care Products$808 $783 3 % % 3 %Medical Surgical Products441 412 7 1 6SharpSafety Products308 320 (4) (4)Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Products221 208 6 6 $1,778 $1,723 3 3 Fiscal Year PercentageChange CurrencyImpact OperationalGrowth(Dollars in Millions)2011 2010 U.S.$1,560 $1,514 3% % 3%Non U.S.218 209 4 3 1 $1,778 $1,723 3 3Net sales for fiscal 2011 increased $55 million to $1.778 billion, compared with $1.723 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in net sales for the segment was primarily driven by increased sales of Medical Surgical Products largely attributable to sales of a new disposable lead wire system. The increase in sales of OEM products was mostly offset by a decline in sales of SharpSafety Products primarily resulting from stronger sales in the comparative prior year period due to the H1N1 flu pandemic. Net sales for fiscal 2011 also benefited from the extra selling week in the fourth quarter, which impacted all product groups.Operating income for fiscal 2011 decreased $7 million to $247 million, compared with $254 million for fiscal 2010. Our operating margin was 13.9% for fiscal 2011, compared with 14.7% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating income and margin primarily resulted from increased raw material costs, partially offset by the overall segment sales performance discussed above.CorporateCorporate expenses were $382 million, $414 million and $419 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in corporate expenses in fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower finance departmental costs and decreased legal and environmental expenses. The timing of stock based compensation expense recognition, and an overall decrease in annual stock based compensation expense, also contributed to the decrease in corporate expenses in fiscal 2012. These decreases were partially offset by increases in benefit costs.Non Operating ItemsInterest Expense and Interest IncomeDuring fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, interest expense was $206 million, $203 million and $199 million, respectively. The slight increase in interest expense for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily resulted from the issuance of $1.25 35Table of Contentsbillion of debt, partially offset by the $500 million repayment of higher interest rate debt, both of which occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2012. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we issued $1.5 billion in senior notes to finance a portion of the ev3 acquisition, which resulted in an increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010. This increase was partially offset by the favorable impact of interest rate swaps entered into in fiscal 2011, the repayment of our $250 million 5.2% senior notes in October 2010 and the absence of $13 million of fees associated with a bridge financing obtained in fiscal 2010 in connection with the acquisition of ev3. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, interest income was $16 million, $22 million and $22 million, respectively.Other Income, netDuring fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded other income, net of $25 million, $22 million and $40 million, respectively. Other income, net includes income and corresponding increases to our receivable from Tyco International and TE Connectivity of $30 million, $29 million and $43 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which reflect 58% of the interest and other income tax payable amounts recorded that are subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Other income, net for fiscal 2012 also includes a $9 million loss on early retirement of debt, which is discussed in "Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCapitalization," partially offset by a gain on investments.Income Tax ExpenseIncome tax expense was $347 million, $333 million and $363 million on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.249 billion, $2.216 billion and $1.926 billion for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 15.4%, 15.0% and 18.8% for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.The increase in the effective tax rates for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily resulted from a favorable settlement reached with certain non U.S. taxing authorities in fiscal 2011, compared to an unfavorable settlement reached with certain non U.S. taxing authorities in fiscal 2012. The release of certain U.S. and non U.S. uncertain tax positions due to statute expirations, which occurred in fiscal 2011, also contributed to the increase in the effective tax rates in fiscal 2012. In addition, the expiration of the U.S. research and development credit as of December 31, 2011 and the retroactive re enactment of the 2010 credit during the first quarter of fiscal 2011, contributed to the increase in the current year effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by the implementation of tax planning strategies, including the release of certain valuation allowances. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011, compared with fiscal 2010, primarily resulted from a favorable settlement reached with certain non U.S. taxing authorities and, to a lesser extent, the release of certain U.S. and non U.S. uncertain tax positions due to statute expirations. In addition, the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted from an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, the retroactive reenactment of the U.S. research and development tax credit and the implementation of our tax planning strategies.Discontinued OperationsSpecialty Chemicals businessDuring fiscal 2010, we sold our Specialty Chemicals business within our Pharmaceuticals segment. We decided to sell this business because its products and customer bases were not aligned with our long term strategic objectives. This business met the discontinued operations criteria, and accordingly is included in discontinued operations.We received net cash proceeds of $273 million and recorded a $20 million pre tax gain on the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business during fiscal 2010. Included within this gain is a $22 million charge associated with an indemnification, which we provided to the purchaser. In addition, we paid $30 million into an escrow account as collateral for this indemnification, of which $25 million remained in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2012. Additional information regarding this indemnification is discussed in Liquidity and Capital ResourcesGuarantees.Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businessesDuring fiscal 2012, we recorded a $12 million tax benefit related to the Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses that were sold in fiscal 2006 prior to our separation from Tyco International. This tax benefit resulted from statute expirations. In addition, during fiscal 2011 and 2010, we recorded a $9 million tax provision and a $20 million tax benefit, respectively, in discontinued operations. These amounts resulted from adjustments to certain income tax liabilities associated with the Plastics, Adhesives, Ludlow Coated Products and A&E Products businesses.36Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur ability to fund our capital needs will be affected by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to the capital markets. We believe, however, that our cash balances and other sources of liquidity, primarily our committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow us to continue to invest in growth opportunities and fund operations for the foreseeable future. A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is provided in the following table:(Dollars in Millions) 2012 2011 2010Net cash provided by (used in) continuing: Operating activities 2,425 2,182 2,185Investing activities (1,678) (480) (3,195)Financing activities (383) (1,771) 1,060Net cash provided by discontinued operations 35Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1) 7 13Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 363 (62) 98Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $2.425 billion, $2.182 billion and $2.185 billion for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.425 billion in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a net change in working capital of $232 million. The net change in working capital was driven largely by an increase in inventory of $275 million, partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable of $111 million. At the end of June 2012, we collected $248 million from the Spanish government, which related to 2011 and prior invoices. In addition, we made net indemnification payments of $37 million related to pre separation tax matters under the Tax Sharing Agreement during fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, we expect to make net indemnification payments of approximately $23 million under the Tax Sharing Agreement. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.182 billion in fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, partially offset by an increase of inventory of $203 million and a decrease in income taxes payable of $423 million. The decrease in income taxes payable primarily resulted from a $404 million advance payment that we made to the IRS in connection with the proposed settlements of U.S. tax audits for the years 1997 through 2004 and other non U.S. audits. We were partially reimbursed by Tyco International and TE Connectivity for this payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition, we made indemnification payments to Tyco International and TE Connectivity under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters in which they were the primary obligor. The total net payment made, including the advance payment to the IRS, was $248 million. Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.185 billion in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes. An increase of income taxes payable of $312 million also contributed to cash provided by continuing operating activities. These amounts were partially offset by a $200 million decrease in accrued and other current liabilities, largely driven by the payment of prior year legal settlements.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities was $1.678 billion, $480 million and $3.195 billion in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Acquisitions and DivestituresDuring fiscal 2012, we made acquisition related payments totaling $1.134 billion, of which $327 million was for the acquisition of Oridion; $322 million was for the acquisition of BRRX; $243 million was for the acquisition of superDimension; and $242 million was for all other acquisitions. During fiscal 2010, we made acquisition related payments totaling $3.012 billion, of which $2.528 billion was for the acquisition of ev3; $291 million was for the acquisition of Somanetics; and $150 million was for the acquisition of Aspect. These amounts were somewhat offset by $263 million of net proceeds from divestitures, primarily related to the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business.37Table of ContentsCapital SpendingCapital expenditures were $526 million, $467 million and $401 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. For the full fiscal year 2013, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $550 million to $575 million.Financing ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $383 million, compared with net cash used in financing activities of $1.771 billion in fiscal 2011 and net cash used in financing activities of $1.060 billion in fiscal 2010. Debt Issuances and RepaymentsAs discussed in "Capitalization," during fiscal 2012 we issued debt for net proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion. We used a portion of these proceeds to fund the redemption of all of our outstanding $500 million 5.5% notes due October 2012. In addition, during fiscal 2012, we received net proceeds of $95 million from the issuance of commercial paper.During fiscal 2011, we used $282 million of cash to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and paid $250 million upon the maturity of our 5.2% senior notes. During fiscal 2010, we issued $1.50 billion of debt for net proceeds of $1.489 billion, which we used to finance a portion of our acquisition of ev3. In addition, during fiscal 2010, we received net proceeds of $246 million under our commercial paper program.Share Repurchases and Option ExercisesWe repurchased approximately 17 million shares for $923 million in fiscal 2012, 19 million shares for $950 million in fiscal 2011 and 8 million shares for $325 million in fiscal 2010 under our share buyback programs. We also repurchase shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares and to settle certain option exercises. We spent $9 million, $5 million and $6 million to acquire shares in connection with these share based awards during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Share repurchases were somewhat offset by proceeds from options exercises of $241 million, $176 million and $107 million in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Dividend PaymentsDividend payments were $434 million, $396 million and $360 million during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect our cash dividend payments to increase in fiscal 2013 as a result of the increase in our quarterly dividend rate discussed in "Dividends." We returned 56%, 62%, and 32% of our operating cash flow to shareholders during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, through a combination of both dividend payments and share repurchases. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, free cash flow returned to shareholders was 72%, 79%, and 39%, respectively.Free cash flow, a non GAAP measure, represents the cash that we have available to pursue opportunities that we believe enhance shareholder value. Management uses this non GAAP financial measure, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. It is also one of the performance metrics that determines management incentive compensation. This non GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow is as follows: (Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 2010Net cash provided by operating activities$2,425 $2,182 $2,185Capital expenditures(526) (467) (401)Free cash flow$1,899 $1,715 $1,784CapitalizationShareholders equity was $10.565 billion, or $22.38 per share, at September 28, 2012, compared with $9.817 billion, or $20.37 per share, at September 30, 2011. The increase in shareholders equity was primarily due to net income of $1.905 billion and share options exercised of $249 million, partially offset by the repurchase of shares of $932 million and dividends declared of $448 million during fiscal 2012.38Table of ContentsThe following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the end of each fiscal year:(Dollars in Millions)2012 2011Cash and cash equivalents$1,866 $1,503Current maturities of long term debt509 11Long term debt4,531 4,197Total debt5,040 4,208Shareholders equity10,565 9,817Debt to total capital ratio32% 30%On May 22, 2012, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.4% senior notes due May 2015 and $650million aggregate principal amount of 3.2% senior notes due June 2022. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed byboth Covidien plc and Covidien Ltd. The net proceeds of approximately $1.24 billion were used to fund the redemption of allof our outstanding $500 million 5.5% senior notes due October 2012 and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the redemption of our senior notes, we recorded a $9 million loss on early retirement of debt in other income, net during fiscal 2012. We have a $1.50 billion five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2016. In addition, we may increase this facility by up to $500 million to a maximum of $2.00 billion provided certain borrowing conditions are met. We are required to maintain an available unused balance under our $1.50 billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. We had $210 million and $115 million of commercial paper outstanding at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. No amount was outstanding under our credit facility at the end of either period.Our credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the agreement contains other customary covenants, none of which we consider restrictive to our operations. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants.DividendsOn September 20, 2012, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.225 per share to $0.26 per share. The dividend, which totaled $123 million, was paid on November 5, 2012 to shareholders of record on October 11, 2012. The timing, declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, our earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of our businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.Share Repurchase ProgramsWe repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time based on market conditions, our cash flows and net debt level to offset dilution related to equity compensation plans or to utilize excess cash to enhance shareholder value. During fiscal 2011 and 2010, we completed our $1.0 billion share repurchase program and our $300 million share repurchase program, respectively. In August 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program. As of September 28, 2012, $877 million remained outstanding under this program.39Table of ContentsCommitments and ContingenciesContractual ObligationsA summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at September 28, 2012 is presented in the following table. (Dollars in Millions)Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 ThereafterDebt(1)$7,278 $701 $198 $1,192 $383 $172 $4,632Capital lease obligations(1)53 8 8 8 6 6 17Operating leases484 126 102 79 61 42 74Purchase obligations(2)239 168 26 22 22 1Contingent consideration108 41 59 8 Total contractual cash obligations$8,162 $1,044 $393 $1,309 $472 $220 $4,724 (1) Interest on debt and capital lease obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of September 28, 2012. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.(2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements.The table above does not include other liabilities of $2.784 billion, primarily consisting of obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties, environmental liabilities, insurable liabilities and obligations under our deferred compensation plan, because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain. The most significant of these liabilities are discussed below.As of September 28, 2012, we had net unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $290 million and $91 million, respectively. While the timing and amounts of long term funding requirements for pension and postretirement obligations are uncertain, in fiscal 2013 we expect to make contributions of $77 million and $8 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding our retirement plans, including the related assumptions.We have $1.163 billion of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and $548 million of related accrued interest and penalties. We are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits.We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including decontamination and decommissioning of radioactive materials and removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of September 28, 2012, we believe that it is probable that we will incur investigation and remedial costs, including asset retirement obligations, of approximately $227 million, of which $19 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and $208 million is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2012. Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding environmental matters, including asset retirement obligations.Legal ProceedingsWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes. We believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial condition. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period. Further information regarding our legal proceedings is provided in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements and in Item 3Legal Proceedings.40Table of ContentsGuaranteesWe have guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and TE Connectivity, which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities. We assumed and are responsible for 42% of these liabilities. Current and non current liabilities totaling $613 million and $660 million relating to these guarantees were included on our consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we made payments totaling $45 million and $55 million, respectively, to Tyco International and TE Connectivity, which represents the 42% reimbursement required pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement for applicable tax and interest payments made by Tyco International and TE Connectivity.In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. Except as discussed below, we generally do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.In connection with the sale of our Specialty Chemicals business, we provided the purchaser with an indemnification for various risks, including environmental, health, safety, tax and other matters, some of which have an indefinite term. However, the most significant portion of this indemnification relates to environmental, health and safety matters, which has a term of 17 years. A liability of $22 million relating to this indemnification was included on our consolidated balance sheet at both September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. The value of the environmental, health and safety guarantee was measured based on the probability weighted present value of the costs expected to be incurred to address environmental claims proposed under the indemnity. As of September 28, 2012, the maximum future payments we could be required to make under the indemnification provided to the purchaser is $77 million. In addition, we were required to pay $30 million into an escrow account as collateral, of which $25 million remained in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2012.We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. In addition, we are liable for product performance; however in the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.We are required to provide the Nuclear Regulatory Commission financial assurance demonstrating our ability to cover the cost of decommissioning our Maryland Heights, Missouri radiopharmaceuticals production facility upon closure. We have provided this financial assurance in the form of a $58 million surety bond. In addition, we had various other outstanding letters of credit and guarantee totaling $207 million as of September 28, 2012.Income TaxesAt September 28, 2012, we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for $1.696 billion of contingent tax liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, of which $1.352 billion relates to periods prior to our separation from Tyco International and which is shared with Tyco International and TE Connectivity pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. However, the actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the Tax Sharing Agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters, some of which may not be resolved for several years. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, we have recorded a receivable from Tyco International and TE Connectivity of $614 million as of September 28, 2012, substantially all of which is non current. This amount primarily reflects 58% of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement. If Tyco International and TE Connectivity default on their obligations to us under the Tax Sharing Agreement, however, we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities. Additional information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement is provided in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable. We invest our excess cash in deposits or money market funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions that have at least an A credit rating. Counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least a Moodys and Standard & Poors long term debt rating of A/A2. While we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments, we minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions and actively monitoring outstanding positions.41Table of ContentsConcentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. A portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the United States, however, include sales to government owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries national economies. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of Western Europe, particularly in Spain, Italy and Portugal, may continue to increase the average length of time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable in certain regions within these countries.We routinely evaluate all government receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. While we have not incurred significant losses on government receivables, if the financial condition of customers or the countries healthcare systems continue to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain, charges may be required in future periods. Our aggregate accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, in Spain, Italy and Portugal and as a percent of our total outstanding accounts receivable at the end of each fiscal year are as follows: (Dollars in Millions)2012 2011 2010Accounts receivable, net in Spain, Italy and Portugal$391 $563 $457Percentage of total accounts receivable, net23% 32% 27% Net sales to customers in Spain, Italy and Portugal totaled $645 million, $732 million and $690 million for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At the end of June 2012, we collected $248 million from the Spanish government, which related to 2011 and prior invoices. As of September 28, 2012, $28 million of the accounts receivable, net in Spain, Italy and Portugal were over 365 days past due.Contingent ConsiderationIn connection with certain of our acquisitions, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue, regulatory or commercialization based milestones. As of the respective acquisition dates, we recorded contingent liabilities representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses. We remeasure these liabilities each reporting period and record changes in the fair value in our consolidated statements of income. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or changes in the expected probability and timing of achieving regulatory or commercialization milestones, as well as changes in discount rates. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recorded expense of $5 million and $4 million, respectively, representing the increases in the estimated fair value of these obligations. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Managements estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.Revenue RecognitionWe recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer, which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site, based on contract terms or legal requirements in non U.S. jurisdictions.We sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers. Rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer. Provisions for rebates, as well as sales discounts and returns, are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns, rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our consolidated balance sheets. We estimate rebates based on sales terms, historical experience and trend analyses. In estimating rebates, we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributors rebate claim, distributor specific trend analyses, contractual commitments, including stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. We adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience, and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment. Historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been 42Table of Contentssignificant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future. Rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $3.436 billion, $3.409 billion, and $3.149 billion, respectively.Intangible AssetsIntangible assets primarily consist of completed technology, customer relationships, trademarks and in process research and development. We record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over ten to forty years. We review intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets, estimated using an income approach, with their carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the present value of future cash flows. We assess the remaining useful life and the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually. GoodwillIn performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. We calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods.We test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We utilize a two step approach. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation, using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with its carrying value. To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill. The results of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2012 showed that the fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values.ContingenciesWe are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, self insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount. We record receivables from third party insurers when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers.Pension and Postretirement BenefitsOur pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans. For our U.S. plans, we use a broad population of Moodys AA rated corporate bonds to determine the discount rate assumption. All bonds are non callable, denominated in U.S. dollars and have a minimum amount outstanding of $250 million. This population of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve, to discount the projected benefit payments for the U.S. plans. The discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve. For our non U.S. plans, the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present 43Table of Contentsvalue of pension obligations by approximately $72 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long term return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $3 million.GuaranteesWe have guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and TE Connectivity, which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities. These arrangements were valued upon separation from Tyco International using appraisals and a liability related to these guarantees was recorded. Each reporting period, we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable. To the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount of the liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, an adjustment is recorded to increase the liability to the amount of such potential loss. To date, this guarantee has not been amortized into income because there has been no predictable pattern of performance. As a result, the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations, which may not occur for some years, or, as payments are made to indemnified parties. We consider the impact of such payments in our periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability.In addition, we have, from time to time, provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties. These guarantees have not been material to our consolidated financial statements. The most significant of these guarantees relates to an indemnification, which we provided to the purchaser of our Specialty Chemicals business, primarily related to environmental, health, safety, tax and other matters. As of September 28, 2012, we have a liability of $22 million on our consolidated balance sheet related to this indemnification; however, we could be required to make payments of up to $77 million. We periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements, and, in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs, a charge to income will be required.Income TaxesIn determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pretax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability is established. We adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. A significant portion of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes, however, which would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.We have recorded significant valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, which we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized. Our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of $5.708 billion and $6.060 billion at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively, relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Included in the valuation allowance at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011 is $5.405 billion and $5.679 billion, respectively, substantially all of which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non U.S. net operating losses recorded in fiscal 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling. It is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized.We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets. However, any reduction in future taxable income, including any future restructuring activities, may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our 44Table of Contentsdeferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an amendment to goodwill impairment testing. This amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. We are required to comply with this amendment beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. In July 2012, the FASB issued an amendment related to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment. This amendment provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired. If the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, it is required to determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value. If the company concludes otherwise, no further quantitative assessment is required. We are required to comply with this amendment beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSWe have made forward looking statements in this report that are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. Forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, potential growth opportunities, potential operating performance improvements, the effects of competition, and the effects of future legislation or regulations. Forward looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as the words believe, expect, plan, intend, anticipate, estimate, predict, potential, continue, may, should or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.Forward looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. You should not put undue reliance on any forward looking statements.The risk factors discussed in Risk Factors could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements. There may be other risks and uncertainties that we are unable to predict at this time or that we currently do not expect to have a material effect on our business. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update these forward looking statements other than as required by law.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks, we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts.Foreign Currency ExposuresForeign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. Such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies. Based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by $54 million and $44 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. A 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by $65 million and $54 million as of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. However, such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions. 45Table of Contents
