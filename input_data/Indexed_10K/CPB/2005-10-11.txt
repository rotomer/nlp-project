Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition Results of Operations Overview 2005 Net earnings were $707 million ($1.71 per share) in 2005 compared to $647 million ($1.57 per share) in 2004. (All earnings per share amounts included in Managements Discussion and Analysis are presented on a diluted basis.) Net earnings between 2005 and 2004 were impacted by an increase in sales, lower corporate expenses and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales and an increase in interest expense. The 2004 results were also impacted by the following: A pre tax restructuring charge of $32 million ($22 million after tax or $.05 per share) related to a reduction in workforce and the implementation of a distribution and logistics realignment in Australia. (See also the section entitled Restructuring Program and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); A pre tax gain of $16 million ($10 million after tax or $.02 per share) from a settlement of a class action lawsuit involving ingredient suppliers; and A pre tax gain of $10 million ($6 million after tax or $.02 per share) from a sale of a manufacturing site in California. The gains were recorded in Other expenses/(income). 2004 In 2004, net earnings increased 3% to $647 million from $626 million before the cumulative effect of accounting change and earnings per share increased 3% to $1.57 from $1.52 in 2003. In addition to the 2004 restructuring charge and gains, earnings between 2004 and 2003 before the cumulative effect of accounting change were also impacted by an increase in sales, favorable currency translation, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales and higher administrative expenses. In addition, there were 52 weeks in 2004 and 53 weeks in 2003. The additional week contributed approximately $.02 per share to earnings. In connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the company recognized a non cash charge of $31 million (net of a $17 million tax benefit), or $.08 per share, in the first quarter of 2003 as a cumulative effect of accounting change. This charge related to impaired goodwill associated with the Stockpot business, a food service business acquired in August 1998. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the first quarter 2004, the company acquired certain Australian chocolate biscuit brands for approximately $9 million. These brands are included in the Baking and Snacking segment. During the first quarter of 2003, the company acquired two businesses for cash consideration of approximately $170 million and assumed debt of approximately $20 million. The company acquired Snack Foods Limited, a leader in the Australian salty snack category, and Erin Foods, the number two dry soup manufacturer in Ireland. Snack Foods Limited is included in the Baking and Snacking segment. Erin Foods is included in the International Soup and Sauces segment. The businesses have annual sales of approximately $160 million.

Table of Contents 9 In 2005, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 3%. U.S. soup sales increased 5%, driven by an 8% gain in condensed soup and a 12% increase in broth, partially offset by a 1% decline in ready to serve soup. The U.S. condensed soup increase was driven by a double digit increase in eating soups, due in part to the combination of successful merchandising and kids promotional marketing programs, increased advertising and higher prices. Cooking varieties of condensed soup also achieved sales growth behind strong performance during the holiday season. Condensed soup sales also benefited from gravity feed shelving systems installed in retail stores. Broth sales increased, driven by gains achieved through its expanded use in cooking and strong consumer response to two new organic varieties in aseptic containers introduced earlier in 2005. In ready to serve soup, Campbells Chunky soup sales increased 7%. These gains were offset by declines in sales of Campbells Select soups and Campbells Kitchen Classics soups. The Campbells Select soups decline of 15% was due to volume losses resulting from competitive activity. Sales of microwaveable soups were flat for the year, as double digit growth of Campbells Chunky and Campbells Select soups in microwaveable bowls was offset by declines in Campbells Soup at Hand sippable soups. In other parts of the business, the launch of Campbells Chunky chili in 2005 added to sales gains. Campbells SpaghettiOs pasta sales rose as consumers responded to the transition from the Franco American brand to the Campbells brand and to new advertising. Sales of Prego pasta sauces declined slightly, while sales of Pace Mexican sauces were flat for the year. V8 vegetable juice sales increased due to higher prices and improved volume, while sales of V8 Splash juice beverages and Campbells tomato juice declined. In 2004, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 2%. U.S. soup sales increased 2%, driven by an 8% gain in ready to serve soup, partially offset by a 2% decline in condensed soup. The ready to serve sales performance was driven by the strong performance from microwaveable soups, including Campbells Select and Campbells Chunky soups, which were introduced in 2004, and Campbells Soup at Hand sippable soups. Broth sales increased 6%. Beverage sales increased, led by growth of V8 vegetable juice. Sales of Pace Mexican sauces were equal to 2003, and Prego pasta sauces experienced a decline in sales, attributable in part to weakness in the dry pasta category. Baking and Snacking sales increased 8% in 2005 versus 2004. Pepperidge Farm contributed significantly to the sales increase as a result of sales gains across bakery, cookies and crackers and frozen, primarily due to higher volume and increased prices. The fresh bakery business experienced double digit growth as a result of expanded distribution and product improvements on bagels and English muffins along with strong results from Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse breads and Pepperidge Farm Carb Style breads and rolls. In cookies and crackers, sales growth was driven by Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chunk cookies, four new soft baked varieties of cookies, and the introduction of sugar free cookies and Whims poppable snacks. In addition, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers delivered sales growth. Pepperidge Farm frozen product sales increased behind the strong performance of pot pies, breads and pastry. Arnotts sales grew primarily due to currency and volume gains. Arnotts achieved sales growth in each of its three businesses: sweet biscuits, savory biscuits and salty snacks. Baking and Snacking sales increased 13% in 2004 versus 2003. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the strengthening of the Australian dollar. Pepperidge Farm contributed to the sales increase as a result of growth in Goldfish crackers and fresh bread. Arnotts achieved an increase in sales driven by innovation on the Tim Tam, Shapes and Jatz products and new product offerings in the Snack Right and Salada brands. International Soup and Sauces sales increased 7% in 2005 versus 2004, driven primarily by currency. In Europe, strong sales gains of wet and dry soups in France and Campbells wet soups in Belgium also contributed to growth. In Asia Pacific, Australian beverages and broth delivered volume gains, while sales increased in Asia, in part, from the launch of a new dry soup product targeting breakfast consumption. Canada achieved volume growth due in part to its ready to serve soup business, which includes a new aseptic variety, Campbells Gardennay soup. International Soup and Sauces sales increased 11% in 2004 versus 2003, primarily due to currency. The increase in volume and mix was driven primarily by sales gains in France, Australia, Belgium and Asia, partially offset by sales declines in the United Kingdom and Germany. In Australia, soup had strong sales and volume growth driven by Campbells Country Ladle and Chunky soup. In Other, sales increased 11% in 2005 versus 2004. Away From Home delivered strong sales growth, led by premium refrigerated soups. Godiva Chocolatiers worldwide sales increased double digits with North America, Europe and Asia all contributing to growth. In North America, Godiva achieved double digit same store sales results driven by successful new products, including sugar free chocolates and the relaunch of truffles. In Other, sales increased 4% in 2004 versus 2003. Away From Home sales grew slightly, primarily due to strong sales of premium refrigerated soups. Godiva Chocolatiers worldwide sales increased due to improving same store sales trends in North America and increased sales in duty free stores. Table of Contents 10 Gross Margin Gross margin, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $135 million in 2005. As a percent of sales, gross margin was 40.5% in 2005, 41.1% in 2004 and 43.0% in 2003. The percentage point decrease in 2005 was due to the impact of inflation and other factors (approximately 3.0 percentage points), a higher level of promotional spending (approximately 0.3 percentage points) and mix (approximately 0.1 percentage points), partially offset by productivity improvements (approximately 2.0 percentage points) and higher selling prices (approximately 0.8 percentage points). The percentage point decrease in 2004 was due to costs associated with quality and packaging improvements (approximately 1.0 percentage point), mix (approximately 0.7 percentage points), higher pension expense and the impact of acquisitions (approximately 0.3 percentage points), and the impact of inflation and other factors (approximately 2.7 percentage points), partially offset by higher selling prices (approximately 0.9 percentage points) and productivity improvements (approximately 1.9 percentage points). Marketing and Selling Expenses Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 15.7% in 2005, 16.2% in 2004 and 17.1% in 2003. Marketing and selling expenses increased 3% in 2005. The increase was driven by higher levels of advertising and currency. In 2004, Marketing and selling expenses increased 1% from 2003. The increase was driven by currency, partially offset by reductions in marketing expenses related to consumer promotion activity and lower media production costs. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.6% in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Administrative expenses increased by 5% in 2005 from 2004. Currency accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the increase and costs associated with the implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America accounted for 2 percentage points of the increase. Administrative expenses increased by 7% in 2004 from 2003. Currency accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the increase, with the balance due to general inflationary increases and costs associated with litigation. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $2 million or 2% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to currency. Research and development expenses increased $5 million or 6% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to currency, which accounted for approximately 4 percentage points of the increase. Other Expenses/(Income) Other income in 2005 of $4 million was primarily royalty income related to the companys brands. Other income in 2004 of $13 million included a $16 million gain from the companys share of a class action settlement involving ingredient suppliers, a $10 million gain on a sale of a manu facturing site, other net income of $4 million, partially offset by a $10 million adjustment to the carrying value of long term investments in affordable housing partnerships and $7 million in expenses from currency hedging related to the financing of international activities. Other expenses of $28 million in 2003 included a $36 million adjustment to the carrying value of long term investments in affordable housing partnerships, $15 million in expenses from currency hedging related to the financing of international activities, partially offset by $16 million of gains on the sales of land and buildings, a $5 million one time payment for the transfer of the Godiva Chocolatier ice cream license, and other net income of $2 million. The sales of land and buildings relate to the closures of a dry soup plant in Ireland ($8 million) and an Arnotts plant in Melbourne, Australia ($8 million). Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings increased 6% in 2005 from 2004. Segment operating earnings declined 3% in 2004 from 2003. The restructuring charge accounted for 2 percentage points of the decline. An analysis of operating earnings by segment follows: % Change 2005/ 2004/ (millions) 2005 20041 2003 2004 2003 U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages $ 747 $ 730 $ 772 2 (5 ) Baking and Snacking 198 166 161 19 3 International Soup and Sauces 221 205 201 8 2 Other 110 101 100 9 1 1,276 1,202 1,234 6 (3 ) Corporate (66 ) (87 ) (129 ) $ 1,210 $ 1,115 $ 1,105 1 Contributions to earnings by segment include the effect of a pre tax fourth quarter 2004 restructuring charge of $32 million as follows: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages $8 million, Baking and Snacking $10 million, International Soup and Sauces $10 million, Other $3 million and Corporate $1 million. Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 2% in 2005 versus 2004. The 2004 results included an $8 million restructuring charge. The remaining increase in 2005 was due to productivity improvements and higher sales volume and prices, partially offset by cost inflation and increased marketing. Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages decreased 5% in 2004 versus 2003. The 2004 results included an $8 million restructuring charge, which accounted for 1 percentage point of the earnings decline. The remainder of the earnings decline was due to quality improvements, higher inflation and product mix, partially offset by an increase in sales and productivity improvements. Table of Contents 11 Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 19% in 2005 versus 2004. The 2004 results included a $10 million restructuring charge. Currency accounted for 3 percentage points of the earnings increase. The remaining increase in earnings was due to sales growth in Pepperidge Farm and improvement in the Snackfoods business in Australia, partially offset by expenses associated with the implementation of a new sales and distribution system in Australia. Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 3% in 2004 versus 2003. The 2004 results included a $10 million restructuring charge, which reduced earnings by 6 percentage points. Currency accounted for 9 percentage points of growth. Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 8% in 2005 versus 2004. The 2004 results included a $10 million restructuring charge. The remaining increase in earnings was due to the favorable impact of currency (6 percentage points) and operating earnings growth in Canada, partially offset by declines in Europe and Latin America. Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 2% in 2004 versus 2003. Currency accounted for 11 percentage points of growth, partially offset by a $10 million restructuring charge (approximately 5 percentage points) and declines in earnings in Canada and Europe. Earnings from Other increased 9% in 2005 from 2004. The 2004 results included a $3 million restructuring charge. Currency accounted for 2 percentage points of the increase. The remainder of the increase was due to the strong sales growth in Godiva Chocolatier and Away From Home. Earnings from Other increased 1% in 2004 from 2003. The 2004 results included a $3 million restructuring charge, which negatively impacted earnings by 3 percentage points. Currency accounted for 4 percentage points of growth. Corporate expenses decreased in 2005 due to lower costs associated with ongoing litigation, lower adjustments related to the carrying value of long term investments in affordable housing partnerships, and lower expenses from currency hedging related to the financing of international activities, partially offset by the gains in 2004 related to the companys share of a class action lawsuit involving ingredient suppliers and the sale of a manufacturing site in California. Corporate expenses decreased in 2004, primarily due to lower adjustments related to the carrying value of long term investments in affordable housing partnerships, the gain from the companys share of a class action lawsuit involving ingredient suppliers, the gain on sale of a manufacturing site in California, lower expenses from currency hedging related to the financing of international activities, partially offset by increases in costs associated with ongoing litigation. Nonoperating Items Interest expense increased 6% in 2005 from 2004, primarily due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower levels of debt. Interest expense declined 6% in 2004 from 2003, primarily due to lower levels of debt. The effective tax rate was 31.4% in 2005, 31.7% in 2004 and 32.2% in 2003. The reduction in the rate in 2005 from 2004 was due to lower international taxes, which reflected a one time benefit in Australia related to a change in tax law. The reduction in the rate from 2003 to 2004 reflected a lower U.S. tax liability which resulted from an increase in charitable contribution deductions and research and development credits, and the favorable resolution of certain income tax audits. Restructuring Program A restructuring charge of $32 million ($22 million after tax) was recorded in the fourth quarter 2004 for severance and employee benefit costs associated with a worldwide reduction in workforce and with the implementation of a distribution and logistics realignment in Australia. These programs are part of cost savings initiatives designed to improve the companys operating margins and asset utilization. Approximately 400 positions were eliminated under the reduction in workforce program resulting in a restructuring charge of $23 million. The reductions represented the elimination of layers of management, elimination of redundant positions due to the realignment of operations in North America, and reorganization of the U.S. sales force. The majority of the terminations occurred in the fourth quarter of 2004. Annual pre tax savings from the reduction are expected to be approximately $40 million beginning in 2005. The distribution and logistics realignment in Australia involves the conversion of a direct store delivery system to a central warehouse system. A restructuring charge of $9 million was recorded for this program. As a result of this program, over 200 positions will be eliminated due to the outsourcing of the infrastructure. The majority of the terminations occurred in 2005. Annual pre tax benefits are expected to be approximately $10 $15 million beginning in 2008. The cash outflows related to these programs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these programs. Table of Contents 12 Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash flows from operating activities provided $990 million in 2005, compared to $744 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to a lower increase in working capital, an increase in earnings, and lower cash settlements related to foreign currency hedging transactions. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $744 million in 2004, compared to $873 million in 2003. The reduction was due to higher working capital requirements and an increase in pension fund contributions, partially offset by an increase in earnings. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled approximately $2.6 billion. This cash generating capability provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs. Capital expenditures were $332 million in 2005, $288 million in 2004 and $283 million in 2003. Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $360 million in 2006. The increase in 2005 was primarily driven by investments to increase manufacturing capacity for microwaveable products, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, increase manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups, and implement a new sales and distribution system in Australia. The increase in 2004 was primarily driven by currency. Capital expenditures in 2004 included projects to increase manufacturing capacity for soup, beverages and Goldfish Sandwich Snackers crackers, as well as investments in U.S. sales systems. Businesses acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows, represents the acquisition of certain brands from George Weston Foods Limited in Australia in the first quarter of 2004 and the acquisitions of Snack Foods Limited and Erin Foods in the first quarter of 2003. There were no new long term borrowings in 2005. Long term borrowings in 2004 included the issuance of $300 million of ten year 4.875% fixed rate notes due October 2013. The proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. While planning for the issuance of these notes, the company entered into treasury lock agreements with a notional value of $100 million that effectively fixed a portion of the interest rate on the debt prior to issuance of the notes. These agreements were settled at a minimal gain upon issuance of the notes, which will be amortized over the life of the notes. In connection with this issuance, the company entered into ten year interest rate swaps that converted $200 million of the fixed rate debt to variable. In September 2003, the company also entered into $100 million five year interest rate swaps that converted a portion of the 5.875% fixed rate notes due October 2008 to variable. In April 2004, the company entered into a $50 million interest rate swap that converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed rate notes due October 2006 to variable. In May 2004, the company entered into a $50 million interest rate swap that converted a portion of the 6.9% fixed rate notes due October 2006 to variable. Long term borrowings in 2003 included the issuance of $400 million of ten year 5% fixed rate notes due December 2012. The proceeds were used to retire $300 million 6.15% notes and to repay commercial paper borrowings. In connection with this issuance, the company entered into ten year interest rate swaps that converted $300 million of the fixed rate debt to variable. In November 2002, the company terminated interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of $250 million that converted fixed rate debt (6.75% notes due 2011) to variable and received $37 million. Of this amount, $3 million represented accrued interest earned on the swap prior to the termination date. The remainder will be amortized over the remaining life of the notes as a reduction to interest expense. In June 2002, the company filed a $1 billion shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to use for future offerings of debt securities. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. The company intends to use the proceeds to repay short term debt, to reduce or retire other indebtedness or for other general corporate purposes. As of July 31, 2005, the company had $300 million available for issuance under this registration statement. Dividend payments were $275 million in 2005 and $259 million in 2004 and 2003. Annual dividends declared in 2005 were $.68 and $.63 per share in 2004 and 2003. The 2005 fourth quarter rate was $.17 per share. The company repurchased 4 million shares at a cost of $110 million during 2005, compared to 2 million shares at a cost of $56 million during 2004 and 1 million shares at a cost of $24 million during 2003. The company expects to repurchase sufficient shares over time to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. See Market For Registrants Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for more information. At July 31, 2005, the company had $451 million of notes payable due within one year and $35 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company maintained committed revolving credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion, which were unused at July 31, 2005 except for $5 million of Table of Contents 13 standby letters of credit. Another $30 million of standby letters of credit was issued under a separate facility. In September 2005, the company entered into a $500 million committed 364 day revolving credit facility, which replaced the existing $500 million 364 day facility that matured in September 2005. The 364 day revolving credit facility contains a one year term out feature. The company also has a $1 billion revolving multi year credit facility. In September 2005, the maturity of this facility was extended from 2009 to 2010. These agreements support the companys commercial paper program. The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities. The company believes that foreseeable liquidity, including the resolution of the contingencies described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and capital resource requirements are expected to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations, management of working capital, long term borrowings under its shelf registration, and short term borrowings, including commercial paper. The company believes that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangements depend on the market conditions and the companys financial position at that time. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities, retail store space, and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations and postemployment benefits. For additional information on other long term liabilities, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2007 2009 (millions) Total 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Debt obligations1 $ 2,993 $ 451 $ 614 $304 $1,624 Interest payments2 951 161 260 212 318 Purchase commitments 1,251 1,008 208 22 13 Operating leases 297 68 107 71 51 Derivative payments 183 7 98 15 63 Other long term liabilities3 149 24 30 23 72 Total long term cash obligations $ 5,824 $ 1,719 $ 1,317 $647 $2,141 1 Includes capital lease obligations totaling $13 million, unamortized net premium on debt issuances, unamortized gain on an interest rate swap and a gain on fair value interest rate swaps. For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Interest payments for notes payable, long term debt and derivative instruments are calculated as follows. For notes payable, interest is based on par values and coupon rates of contractually obligated issuances at fiscal year end. For long term debt, interest is based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. Interest on fixed rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at fiscal year end. Interest on variable rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts contractually obligated at fiscal year end and weighted average rates estimated over the instruments life using forward interest rates plus applicable spreads. 3 Represents other long term liabilities, excluding deferred taxes and minority interest. This table does not include postretirement medical benefits or payments related to pension plans. The company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan subsequent to July 31, 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 1,400 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $112 million. The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off balance sheet arrangements. Inflation During the past two years, inflation, on average, has been higher than previous years but has not had a significant effect on the company. The company uses a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies, and making capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations. Table of Contents 14 Market Risk Sensitivity The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain employee compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate and fixed rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable to total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for over 35% of 2005 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short and long term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company may also enter into commodity futures contracts, as considered appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil and wheat. At July 31, 2005 and August 1, 2004, the notional values and unrealized gains or losses on commodity futures contracts held by the company were not material. The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of July 31, 2005. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 16 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Variable interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rates of the portfolio at the period end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the weighted average forward rates for the term of each contract.

The notional value of these swap contracts was $1 billion as of August 1, 2004 and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was $(154) million as of August 1, 2004. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The table below summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of July 31, 2005.

The aggregate fair value of all contracts was $3 million as of July 31, 2005. Total forward exchange contracts outstanding as of August 1, 2004 were $255 million with a fair value of $2 million. Table of Contents 16 The company had swap contracts outstanding as of July 31, 2005, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain employee compensation obligations linked to the total return of the Standard Poors 500 Index, the total return of the companys capital stock and beginning in February 2005, the total return of the Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the Standard Poors 500 Index total return, the Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company capital stock. The notional value of the contracts that are linked to the return on the Standard Poors 500 Index was $20 million at July 31, 2005 and $21 million at August 1, 2004. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2006, was 4.02% at July 31, 2005. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Puritan Fund was $9 million at July 31, 2005. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2006, was 4.38% at July 31, 2005. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on company capital stock was $20 million at July 31, 2005 and $13 million at August 1, 2004. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2006, was 4.43% at July 31, 2005. The fair value of these contracts was a $1 million gain at both July 31, 2005 and August 1, 2004. The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities. Significant Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature price discounts, in store display incentives and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are classified as a reduction of revenue, involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates. Valuation of long lived assets Long lived assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other long lived asset impairment. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. Pension and postretirement medical benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent financial consultants apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year. Table of Contents 17 When the fair value of pension plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation, an additional minimum liability is recorded in Other comprehensive income within Shareowners Equity. As of July 31, 2005 and August 1, 2004, Shareowners Equity includes a minimum liability, net of tax, of $238 million and $196 million, respectively. Net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense was $67 million in 2005, $65 million in 2004, and $43 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 was primarily due to a lower discount rate and a reduction in the expected return on assets, partially offset by the expected returns associated with a $50 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan. Significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows: Pension 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate for benefit obligations 5.44 % 6.19 % 6.39 % Expected return on plan assets 8.76 % 8.76 % 8.80 % Postretirement 2005 2004 2003 Discount rate for obligations 5.50 % 6.25 % 6.50 % Initial health care trend rate 9.00 % 9.00 % 9.00 % Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Estimated sensitivities to the net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $12 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $8 million. A one percentage point change in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $2 million. Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the U.S. plans in 2005 and 2004, the company made $35 million and $50 million contributions, respectively, to a U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements. Contributions to international plans were $26 million in 2005 and $15 million in 2004. In 2003, there were no contributions to the U.S. plans and contributions to international plans were $19 million. Subsequent to July 31, 2005, the company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan in anticipation of future funding requirements. See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement medical expenses. Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax reserves are established when, despite the companys belief that tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions are subject to challenge and the company may not successfully defend its position. These reserves, as well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the company believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See also the section entitled Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes, including the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA). Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retirement health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In accordance with FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 106 1, the company elected in January 2004 to defer recognizing the effects of the Act on accounting for postretirement health care plans until the FASB guidance was finalized. In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FSP FAS 106 2, which provides accounting guidance to sponsors of postretirement health care plans that are impacted by the Act. The FSP is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The company believes that certain drug benefits offered under postretirement health care plans will qualify for the subsidy under Medicare Part D. The effects of the subsidy were factored into the 2004 annual year end valuation. The reduction in the benefit obligation attributable to past service cost was approximately $32 million and has been reflected as an actuarial gain. The reduction in benefit cost for 2005 related to the Act was approximately $5 million. Table of Contents 18 In November 2004, SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 was issued. SFAS No. 151 is the result of efforts to converge U.S. accounting standards for inventories with International Accounting Standards. SFAS No. 151 requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage to be recognized as current period charges. It also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004) Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires employee stock based compensation to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the cost to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The Statement eliminates the alternative use of Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25s intrinsic value method of accounting for awards, which is the companys accounting policy for stock options. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the pro forma impact of compensation expense from stock options on net earnings and earnings per share. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the beginning of fiscal 2006. The company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R on a prospective basis. The financial statement impact will be dependent on future stock based awards and any unvested stock options outstanding at the date of adoption. In October 2004, the AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA provides for a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined by the AJCA, and a phased in tax deduction related to profits from domestic manufacturing activities. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109 1 and 109 2 to address the accounting and disclosure requirements related to the AJCA. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the AJCA along with the additional technical guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department. The company will complete its evaluation in fiscal 2006. The company estimates the range of possible amounts considered for repatriation to be between $200 and $425 million and the related impact on income tax to be between $7 and $16 million. Based on the companys plans related to the AJCA as of 2005, tax expense of $7 million has been recorded for amounts expected to be repatriated. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47) Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. This Interpretation clarifies that a conditional retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and (or) method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and (or) method of settlement. Accordingly, an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated. The liability should be recognized when incurred, generally upon acquisition, construction or development of the asset. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of the fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The company is in the process of evaluating the impact of FIN 47 but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the financial statements. Earnings Outlook On September 12, 2005, the company issued a press release announcing results for 2005 and commented on the outlook for earnings per share for 2006. Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results This Report contains forward looking statements that reflect the companys current expectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever possible, to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, will and similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements reflect the companys current plans and expectations and are based on information currently available to it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The company wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors and those important factors described elsewhere in the commentary, or in the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the company, could affect the companys actual results and could cause such results to vary materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company: the impact of strong competitive response to the companys efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation, promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in consumer demand for the companys products; Table of Contents 19 the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives, and new product introductions; the companys ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on assumptions about sales volume and product mix, and the impact of marketing and pricing actions; the companys ability to realize projected cost savings and benefits, including those contemplated by restructuring programs and other cost savings initiatives; the companys ability to successfully manage changes to its business processes, including selling, distribution, product capacity, information management systems and the integration of acquisitions; the increased significance of certain of the companys key trade customers; the difficulty of predicting the pattern of inventory movements by the companys trade customers and of predicting changes in the policies of its customers, such as changes in customer inventory levels and access to shelf space; the impact of fluctuations in the supply and cost of raw materials; the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in the companys Securities and Exchange Commission filings; the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates, interest rates, equity markets, inflation rates, recession and other external factors; and the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the companys markets due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other calamities. This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the companys outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or intent to update forward looking statements made by the company in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date they are made.
