ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Overview Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of high quality, branded convenience food products. The company is focused on achieving long term sustainable quality growth through executing five key strategies to drive success in both the marketplace and the workplace as follows: Expanding the companys well known brands within the simple meal and baked snack categories; Trading consumers up to higher levels of satisfaction centering on convenience, wellness and quality; Making the companys products more broadly available in existing and new markets; Increasing margins by improving price realization and company wide productivity; and Improving overall organizational diversity, engagement, excellence and agility. The company intends to meet financial and business goals while continuing to invest in innovation, in information systems and in emerging markets. On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for 460 million, or approximately $870 million, pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement dated July 12, 2006. The United Kingdom and Ireland businesses included Homepride sauces, OXO stock cubes, Batchelors soups and McDonnells and Erin soups. The purchase price was subject to certain post closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $19 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the results of these businesses as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses were reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of July 30, 2006. The company used approximately $620 million of the net proceeds to purchase company stock. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In June 2007, the company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Papua New Guinea operations for approximately $23 million. This business had annual sales of approximately $20 million. On August 9, 2007, the company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives, including possible divestiture, for its Godiva Chocolatier business. The company is organized and reports operating results as follows: U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages, Baking and Snacking and International Soup and Sauces, with the balance of the portfolio, which includes Godiva Chocolatier worldwide and the Away From Home operations, reported as Other. See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on segments. Results of Operations 2007 Earnings from continuing operations were $823 million ($2.08 per share) in 2007 and $755 million ($1.82 per share) in 2006. (All earnings per share amounts included in Managements Discussion and Analysis are presented on a diluted basis.) There were several items that impacted the comparability of Earnings from continuing operations and Earnings per share from continuing operations: In the second quarter of 2007, the company recorded a pre tax gain of $23 million ($14 million after tax or $.04 per share) from the sale of an idle manufacturing facility; In the third quarter of 2007, the company recorded a pre tax non cash benefit of $20 million ($13 million after tax or $.03 per share) from the reversal of legal reserves due to favorable results in litigation; In the third quarter of 2007, the company recorded a tax benefit of $22 million resulting from the settlement of bilateral advance pricing agreements (APA) among the company, the United States, and Canada related to royalties. In addition, the company reduced net interest by $4 million ($3 million after tax). The aggregate impact on Earnings from continuing operations was $25 million, or $.06 per share; In the first quarter of 2006, the company recorded a non cash tax benefit of $47 million resulting from the favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency related to transactions in government securities in a prior period. In addition, the company reduced interest expense and accrued interest payable by $21 million and adjusted deferred tax expense by $8 million ($13 million after tax). The aggregate non cash impact of the settlement on Earnings from continuing operations was $60 million, or $.14 per share. (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); In the first quarter of 2006, a $13 million pre tax gain was recognized due to a change in the method of accounting for certain U.S. inventories from the LIFO method to the average cost method. The impact on Earnings from continuing operations was $8 million ($.02 per share). Prior periods were not restated since the impact of the change on previously issued financial statements was not considered material. (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements); Table of Contents 11 In 2006, incremental tax expense of $13 million ($.03 per share) was recognized associated with incremental dividends of $294 million as the company finalized its plan to repatriate earnings from non U.S. subsidiaries under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA); and In the fourth quarter of 2006, the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $14 million ($.03 per share) from the anticipated use of higher levels of foreign tax credits, which could be utilized as a result of the sale of the companys United Kingdom and Ireland businesses in August 2006. The items impacting comparability are summarized below: 2007 2006 (millions, except per share amounts) Earnings EPS Earnings EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 823 $ 2.08 $ 755 $ 1.82 Reversal of legal reserves $ (13 ) $ (0.03 ) $ $ Tax benefit from the resolution of the APA (25 ) (0.06 ) Gain on the sale of facility (14 ) (0.04 ) Impact of change in inventory accounting method (8 ) (0.02 ) Favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency (60 ) (0.14 ) Tax expense on repatriation of earnings under the AJCA 13 0.03 Tax benefit related to the anticipated use of foreign tax credits (14 ) (0.03 ) Impact of significant items on continuing operations1 $ (52 ) $ (0.13 ) $ (69 ) $ (0.17 ) 1 The sum of the individual per share amounts does not equal due to rounding. In addition, the comparability of Earnings per share from continuing operations was impacted by the use of proceeds from the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses in the first quarter of 2007. During the first quarter of 2007, the company completed its previously announced program utilizing $620 million of the net proceeds to repurchase shares. The pro forma impact on 2006 of utilizing those proceeds to repurchase 17 million shares (based on the average stock price in the first quarter) and reduce shares outstanding in the calculation of Earnings per share from continuing operations would have resulted in a $.07 increase in Earnings per share from continuing operations. The remaining increase in Earnings from continuing operations in 2007 from 2006 was primarily due to an increase in sales, a higher gross margin as a percentage of sales, and lower net interest expense, partially offset by increased marketing expenses and a higher effective tax rate. 2006 Earnings from continuing operations were $755 million ($1.82 per share) in 2006 and $644 million ($1.56 per share) in 2005. In addition to the 2006 items that impacted the comparability of Earnings from continuing operations, as of August 1, 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Under SFAS No. 123R, compensation expense is to be recognized for all stock based awards, including stock options. Had all stock based compensation been expensed in 2005, Earnings from continuing operations would have been $616 million and Earnings per share from continuing operations would have been $1.49. (See Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The items impacting comparability are summarized below: 2006 2005 (millions, except per share amounts) Earnings EPS Earnings EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 755 $ 1.82 $ 644 $ 1.56 Pro forma impact of SFAS No. 123R $ $ $ (28 ) $ (0.07 ) Impact of change in inventory accounting method (8 ) (0.02 ) Favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency (60 ) (0.14 ) Tax expense on repatriation of earnings under the AJCA 13 0.03 Tax benefit related to the anticipated use of foreign tax credits (14 ) (0.03 ) Impact of significant items on continuing operations1 $ (69 ) $ (0.17 ) $ (28 ) $ (0.07 ) 1 The sum of the individual per share amounts does not equal due to rounding. The remaining improvement in earnings from 2005 to 2006 was due to an increase in sales, an improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales, a lower effective tax rate, and higher interest income, partially offset by higher administrative and marketing and selling costs. Sales An analysis of net sales by reportable segment follows: % Change 2007/ 2006/ (millions) 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages $ 3,486 $ 3,257 $ 3,098 7 5 Baking and Snacking 1,850 1,747 1,742 6 International Soup and Sauces 1,399 1,255 1,227 11 2 Other 1,132 1,084 1,005 4 8 $ 7,867 $ 7,343 $ 7,072 7 4 Table of Contents 12 An analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows: U.S. Soup, International Sauces and Baking and Soup and 2007/2006 Beverages Snacking Sauces Other Total Volume and Mix 5 % 2 % 5 % 2 % 3 % Price and Sales Allowances 2 2 1 3 2 Increased Promotional Spending1 (1 ) (1 ) Currency 3 5 2 7 % 6 % 11 % 4 % 7 % U.S. Soup, International Sauces and Baking and Soup and 2006/2005 Beverages Snacking Sauces Other Total Volume and Mix (1 )% % 3 % 6 % 1 % Price and Sales Allowances 6 3 3 3 Increased Promotional Spending1 (2 ) (1 ) Currency (1 ) (1 ) 5 % % 2 % 8 % 4 % 1 Represents revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs. In 2007, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 7%. U.S. soup sales increased 5% as condensed soup sales increased 3%, ready to serve soup sales increased 5% and broth sales increased 12%. The introduction in 2007 of new lower sodium varieties of condensed and ready to serve soups contributed to the sales growth. Within condensed soup, both eating and cooking varieties delivered solid sales gains. Sales growth in ready to serve was driven by gains in Campbells Chunky and Campbells Select soups which benefited from higher levels of advertising. In the convenience platform, which includes soups in microwavable bowls and cups, sales grew double digits. Swanson broth sales grew due to increased advertising and continued growth of aseptically packaged products. Beverage sales grew significantly as V8 vegetable juice and V8 V Fusion vegetable and fruit juice, introduced in the second quarter of 2006, responded favorably to new advertising campaigns and increased levels of advertising. V8 Splash juice drinks also experienced sales growth. Sales of Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces increased. In 2006, U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages sales increased 5%. U.S. soup sales increased 4% as condensed soup sales increased 5%, ready to serve soup sales increased 1% and broth sales increased 11%. The U.S. Soup sales growth was primarily driven by higher prices across the portfolio. Condensed soup also benefited from the additional installation of gravity feed shelving systems and increased advertising. The ready to serve sales performance was positively impacted by the introductions of Campbells Select Gold Label soups in aseptic packaging and Campbells Chicken Noodle, Tomato and Vegetable soups in microwavable bowls, which were partially offset by the discontinuance of Campbells Kitchen Classics soups and a decline in Campbells Chunky soups. The introduction of Campbells Chicken Noodle, Tomato and Vegetable soups in microwavable bowls, combined with sales gains from Campbells Chunky and Campbells Select soups in microwavable bowls and Campbells Soup at Hand sippable soups, drove significant growth in the convenience platform. Swanson broth sales growth was primarily due to volume gains of aseptically packaged products and successful holiday merchandising. In other parts of the business, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces delivered solid sales growth. Beverage sales increased double digits driven by V8 vegetable juices, which had strong volume growth. The introduction of V8 V Fusion juice beverages also contributed to sales growth, while sales of V8 Splash juice beverages declined. In 2007, Baking and Snacking sales increased 6%. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily as a result of gains in the bakery and cookies and crackers businesses. The bakery business sales growth was driven by gains in Pepperidge Farm whole grain breads and sandwich rolls. The cookies and crackers sales growth was primarily due to Pepperidge Farm Goldfish snack crackers, partially offset by a decline in cookies. Arnotts sales increased, primarily due to the favorable impact of currency and strong branded biscuits sales performance, partially offset by volume declines in the Australian snack foods business. In 2006, Baking and Snacking sales were flat versus 2005 as growth at Pepperidge Farm was offset by declines in the Arnotts business. Pepperidge Farm reported sales increases in its bakery and cookies and crackers businesses. Sales of bakery products increased due to the strong performance of Pepperidge Farm whole grain breads. Sales gains in cookies and crackers were primarily due to double digit growth of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish snack crackers. Arnotts sales declined, primarily due to a decline in the Australian snack foods business and the unfavorable impact of currency. International Soup and Sauces sales increased 11% in 2007 versus 2006. In Europe, sales increased primarily due to the favorable impact of currency and strong wet soup growth in France, Germany and Belgium. In Canada, sales increased due to growth in soup and the favorable impact of currency. International Soup and Sauces sales increased 2% in 2006 versus 2005. In Canada, sales increased due to the favorable impact of currency and a strong performance in ready to serve soup, which grew double digits, aided by the introduction of Campbells Soup at Hand sippable soups. Sales from the Australian soup business increased double digits, primarily due to the performance of ready to serve soup and broth. In Europe, sales declined primarily due to currency. Excluding the impact of currency, sales in Europe grew slightly driven by the business in Belgium and higher sales of V8 vegetable juice. Table of Contents 13 In Other, sales increased 4% in 2007 versus 2006. Godiva Chocolatier sales increased primarily due to growth in Asia and North America. Away From Home sales increased primarily due to strong growth of frozen soups and beverages. In Other, sales increased 8% in 2006 versus 2005. Godiva Chocolatier sales increased primarily due to same store sales growth in all regions, new product introductions in the U.S., an increase in duty free sales in Europe and new stores in Asia. Away From Home sales increased primarily due to sales growth in soup, including refrigerated soups, and beverages. Gross Profit Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $226 million in 2007 from 2006 and $177 million in 2006 from 2005. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 41.9% in 2007, 41.8% in 2006 and 40.9% in 2005. The percentage point increase in 2007 was due to productivity improvements (approximately 1.9 percentage points), higher selling prices (approximately 1.2 percentage points), and mix (approximately 0.3 percentage points), partially offset by a higher level of promotional spending (approximately 0.1 percentage points), costs associated with the relocation and start up of a replacement refrigerated soup facility (approximately 0.1 percentage points), a benefit from a change in the method of accounting for inventory in 2006 (approximately 0.2 percentage points), and the impact of cost inflation and other factors (approximately 2.9 percentage points). The percentage point increase in 2006 was due to higher selling prices (approximately 2.0 percentage points), productivity improvements (approximately 1.8 percentage points), and a benefit from a change in the method of accounting for inventory (approximately 0.2 percentage points), partially offset by a higher level of promotional spending (approximately 0.1 percentage points), mix (approximately 0.2 percentage points) and cost inflation and other factors (approximately 2.8 percentage points). Gross profit would have been $4 million lower in 2005 had all stock based compensation been expensed. Marketing and Selling Expenses Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 16.8% in 2007, 16.7% in 2006 and 16.3% in 2005. Marketing and selling expenses increased 8% in 2007 from 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 5 percentage points), higher selling expenses (approximately 1 percentage point) and the impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage point). Marketing and selling expenses increased 6% in 2006. The increase was driven primarily by higher advertising (approximately 3 percentage points), higher selling expenses (approximately 2 percentage points) and increased stock based compensation recognized under SFAS No. 123R (approximately 1 percentage point). Marketing and selling expenses would have been $12 million higher in 2005 had all stock based compensation been expensed. Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.7% in 2007, 7.9% in 2006 and 7.4% in 2005. Administrative expenses increased 4% in 2007 from 2006. The increase was due to higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage points), costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America (approximately 1 percentage point), costs to establish businesses in Russia and China (approximately 1 percentage point), the impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage point) and higher general administrative expenses (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves resulting from favorable results in litigation (approximately 3 percentage points). Administrative expenses increased 12% in 2006 from 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher stock based compensation recognized under SFAS No. 123R (approximately 5 percentage points), higher compensation and benefit expenses (approximately 4 percentage points), and an increase in costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America (approximately 2 percentage points). Administrative expenses would have been $25 million higher in 2005 had all stock based compensation been expensed. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses increased $8 million or 8% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to expenses related to new product development (approximately 4 percentage points), higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage points) and the impact of currency (approximately 1 percentage point). Research and development expenses increased $11 million or 12% in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to higher stock based compensation recognized under SFAS No. 123R (approximately 4 percentage points), higher compensation and benefit expenses (approximately 4 percentage points) and expenses related to new product development (approximately 4 percentage points). Research and development expenses would have been $4 million higher in 2005 had all stock based compensation been expensed. Other Expenses / (Income) Other income of $35 million in 2007 included a $23 million gain on the sale of an idle manufacturing facility, a $10 million gain on a settlement in lieu of condemnation of a refrigerated soup facility, and a $3 million gain on the sale of the companys business in Papua New Guinea. Table of Contents 14 Other expense of $5 million in 2006 included the cost of acquiring the rights to the Pepperidge Farm Goldfish trademark in certain non U.S. countries and a write down of a trademark used in the Australian snack foods market. Other income of $5 million in 2005 was primarily royalty income related to the companys brands. Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings increased 11% in 2007 from 2006. Segment operating earnings increased 5% in 2006 from 2005. Operating earnings would have been $45 million lower in 2005 had all stock based compensation been expensed. An analysis of operating earnings by reportable segment follows: % Change 2007/ 2006/ (millions) 2007 2006 2005 2006 2005 U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages $ 862 $ 815 $ 747 6 9 Baking and Snacking 240 187 198 28 (6 ) International Soup and Sauces 169 144 143 17 1 Other 124 110 110 13 1,395 1,256 1,198 11 5 Unallocated corporate expenses (102 ) (105 ) (66 ) $ 1,293 $ 1,151 $ 1,132 Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 6% in 2007 from 2006. The 2006 results included an $8 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The remaining increase in earnings was primarily due to the increase in sales and productivity improvements, partially offset by cost inflation and higher advertising expense. Earnings from U.S. Soup, Sauces and Beverages increased 9% in 2006 from 2005. The 2006 results included an $8 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The 2005 earnings would have been $4 million lower had all stock based compensation been expensed. The remaining increase in earnings was primarily due to higher selling prices and productivity gains, which were partially offset by cost inflation and higher advertising expense. Earnings from Baking and Snacking increased 28% in 2007 from 2006. The 2007 results included a $23 million gain from the sale of an idle Pepperidge Farm manufacturing facility. The 2006 results included a $5 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Pepperidge Farm and the favorable impact of currency. Within Arnotts, excluding the impact of currency, an earnings increase in the biscuit business was offset by a decline in the Australian snack foods business. Earnings from Baking and Snacking decreased 6% in 2006 from 2005. The 2006 results included a $5 million benefit from the change in the method of accounting for inventories. The 2005 earnings would have been $8 million lower had all stock based compensation been expensed. The earnings results were driven by declines in the Indonesian biscuit business and the Australian snack foods business, and the unfavorable impact of currency, partially offset by higher earnings at Pepperidge Farm. Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 17% in 2007 from 2006. The increase in earnings was primarily due to earnings growth in the businesses in Europe and Canada and the favorable impact of currency, partially offset by costs to establish businesses in Russia and China. Earnings from International Soup and Sauces increased 1% in 2006 from 2005. The 2005 earnings would have been $3 million lower had all stock based compensation been expensed. The increase in earnings was primarily due to strong market performance in Canada, partially offset by expenses associated with improving the cost structure of the supply chain in Europe and realigning the organizational structure in Europe following the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses. Earnings from Other increased 13% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to improved operating earnings performance from the Away From Home business and a gain on settlement in lieu of condemnation of a refrigerated soup facility, partially offset by relocation and start up costs associated with the replacement facility. Earnings from Other were $110 million in both 2006 and 2005. Earnings in 2005 would have been $6 million lower had all stock based awards been expensed. The increase was primarily due to earnings growth in Godiva Chocolatier. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $3 million from $105 million in 2006 to $102 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves resulting from favorable results in litigation, mostly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and higher expenses associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America. Unallocated corporate expenses increased $39 million from $66 million in 2005 to $105 million in 2006. The 2005 expenses would have been $24 million higher had all stock based compensation been expensed. The remaining increase was primarily due to costs associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America. Table of Contents 15 Interest Expense/Income Interest expense decreased 1% in 2007 from 2006. The current year included a $4 million reduction in interest associated with the APA settlement. In 2006, interest expense included a non cash reduction of $21 million related to a favorable tax settlement of a U.S. tax contingency. The remaining net reduction in 2007 was primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest expense associated with tax matters, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income increased to $19 million in 2007 from $15 million in 2006 due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased 10% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the non cash reduction of $21 million associated with the favorable settlement of a U.S. tax contingency and lower levels of debt, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income increased to $15 million in 2006 from $4 million in 2005 due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents. Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 28.4% in 2007, 24.6% in 2006, and 32.4% in 2005. The increase in rate from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to lower tax settlement amounts and higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2007. The current year included a benefit of $22 million resulting from the favorable settlement of the APA and an additional net benefit of $40 million following the finalization of the 2002 2004 U.S. federal tax audits. The prior year period included a benefit of $47 million resulting from the favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency and a benefit of $21 million related to the favorable resolution of the 1996 2001 U.S. federal tax audits. After factoring in these items, the increase in the 2007 effective rate is primarily due to higher taxes on foreign earnings. The reduction in rate from 2005 to 2006 was attributable primarily to the favorable resolution of federal income tax audits, a $10 million increased deduction related to U.S. manufacturing activities under the AJCA, and higher levels of foreign tax credits of $14 million, partially offset by incremental tax expense associated with the repatriation of non U.S. earnings under the AJCA of $13 million. The effective tax rate is expected to increase to 32% to 33% in 2008. Discontinued Operations The results of the companys businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland sold in August 2006 are classified as discontinued operations. Results of the businesses are summarized below: (millions) 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 16 $ 435 $ 476 Earnings from operations before income taxes $ $ 90 $ 78 Tax (expense) benefit on earnings from operations 7 (18 ) (15 ) Pre tax gain on sale of discontinued operations 39 Deferred tax expense/after tax costs associated with sale (61 ) Tax impact of gain on sale (15 ) Earnings from discontinued operations $ 31 $ 11 $ 63 The 2007 results included a $24 million after tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the sale. The 2007 results also included a $7 million tax benefit from the favorable resolution of tax audits in the United Kingdom. The 2006 results included $56 million of deferred tax expense, which was recognized in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 93 17 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent Companys Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary That is Accounted for as a Discontinued Operation. Results also included $7 million pre tax ($5 million after tax) of costs associated with the sale of the businesses. The remaining increase in earnings in 2006 from 2005 was primarily due to lower marketing and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decline in sales, the unfavorable impact of currency, and a higher tax rate. The company used $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale to purchase company stock. The remaining net proceeds were used to settle foreign currency hedging contracts associated with intercompany financing transactions of the business, to pay taxes and expenses associated with the sale, and to repay debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase shares and pay dividends, will be met through cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, long term borrowings under its shelf registration and short term borrowings, including commercial paper. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled approximately $2.9 billion. This cash generating capability provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating Table of Contents 16 and investing needs. The company believes that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangements depend on the market conditions and the companys financial position at that time. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $674 million in 2007, compared to $1,226 million in 2006. The reduction was due primarily to an increase in working capital in 2007 as compared to a decline in 2006 and payments of $186 million to settle hedging transactions, primarily related to foreign currency. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $1,226 million in 2006, compared to $990 million in 2005. The increase was due primarily to a reduction in working capital and an increase in earnings. Capital expenditures were $334 million in 2007, $309 million in 2006 and $332 million in 2005. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million in 2008. Capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 included investments to increase the manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups in a new facility, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, and implement certain productivity and quality projects in manufacturing facilities. Capital expenditures in 2005 included investments to increase manufacturing capacity for microwavable products, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, increase manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups, and implement a new sales and distribution system in Australia. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 includes $906 million of proceeds from the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Papua New Guinea, net of cash divested. There were no new long term borrowings in 2007 and 2005. Long term borrowings in 2006 included the issuance of $202 million of five year variable rate debt in Australia due July 2011. The proceeds were used to repatriate earnings pursuant to the AJCA. While planning for the issuance of the debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate on $149 million of the debt prior to its issuance. Dividend payments were $308 million in 2007, $292 million in 2006 and $275 million in 2005. Annual dividends declared in 2007 were $.80 per share, $.72 per share in 2006 and $.68 per share in 2005. The 2007 fourth quarter rate was $.20 per share. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 30 million shares at a cost of $1,140 million during 2007. Of the 2007 repurchases, approximately 21 million shares at a cost of $820 million were made pursuant to the companys two publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Under the first share repurchase program, which was announced on November 21, 2005, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of company stock through fiscal 2008. Under the second share repurchase program, which was announced on August 15, 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized using up to $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company stock. The August 2006 program terminated at the end of fiscal 2007. Pursuant to the publicly announced programs, the company entered into two accelerated share repurchase agreements on September 28, 2006, with a financial institution to repurchase approximately $600 million of stock. These agreements were settled in July 2007. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements for additional information on these agreements. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 15 million shares at a cost of $506 million during 2006 and 4 million shares at a cost of $110 million during 2005. Of the 2006 repurchases, 6 million shares at a cost of $200 million were under the Board of Directors authorization announced on November 21, 2005. See Market for Registrants Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for more information. At July 29, 2007, the company had $595 million of notes payable due within one year and $33 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company maintained a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility, which was unused at July 29, 2007, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit. Another $32 million of standby letters of credit was issued under a separate facility. In September 2006, the company entered into the $1.5 billion, 5 year revolving credit facility that will mature in September 2011. This agreement supports the companys commercial paper programs. As of July 29, 2007, the company had $300 million available for issuance under a $1 billion shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2002. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions. The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities. Table of Contents 17 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities, retail store space, and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long term liabilities, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Interest payments for notes payable, long term debt and derivative instruments are calculated as follows. For notes payable, interest is based on par values and rates of contractually obligated issuances at fiscal year end. For fixed rate long term debt, interest is based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. For variable rate long term debt, interest is based on principal amounts and rates estimated over the life of the instrument using forward interest rates and applicable spreads. Interest on fixed rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at fiscal year end. Interest on variable rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts contractually obligated at fiscal year end and rates estimated over the instruments life using forward interest rates plus applicable spreads. 3 Represents payments of cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts. 4 Represents other long term liabilities, excluding deferred taxes and minority interest. This table does not include postretirement benefits, payments related to pension plans or unvested stock based compensation. The company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. pension plan subsequent to July 29, 2007. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 1,700 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $136 million. The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off balance sheet arrangements. On September 28, 2006, the company entered into two accelerated share repurchase agreements (Agreements) with Lehman Brothers Financial S.A. (Lehman), an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc., to repurchase approximately $600 million of common stock. Under the first Agreement, the company purchased approximately 8.3 million shares of its common stock from Lehman for $300 million, or $35.95 per share, subject to a purchase price adjustment payable upon settlement of the Agreement. Lehman was expected to purchase an equivalent number of shares during the term of the Agreement. On July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of the Agreement, the company made a settlement payment of $22 million to Lehman, which was recorded as a reduction of Additional paid in capital, based upon the difference between the volume weighted average price of the companys common stock during the Agreements term of $38.90 and the purchase price of $35.95. Under the second Agreement, the company purchased approximately $300 million of its common stock from Lehman. Under this Agreement, Lehman made an initial delivery of 6.3 million shares on September 29, 2006 at $35.95 per share and a second delivery of 1.3 million shares on October 25, 2006 at $36.72 per share. Under the Agreement, the number of additional shares (if any) to be delivered to the company at settlement would be based on the volume weighted average price of company stock during the term of the Agreement, subject to a minimum and maximum price for the purchased shares. The volume weighted average price during the term of the Agreement was $38.90. On July 5, 2007, upon conclusion of the Agreement, Lehman delivered approximately 200,000 shares to the company as a final settlement. For additional information on the Agreements, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Market for Registrants Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Inflation During the past three years, inflation, on average, has been higher than previous years but has not had a significant effect on the company. The company uses a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies, and making capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations. Table of Contents 18 Market Risk Sensitivity The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate and fixed rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable to total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 30% of 2007 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France and Germany. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short and long term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company may also enter into commodity futures contracts, as considered appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such as corn, cocoa, soybean meal, soybean oil, wheat, dairy and natural gas. At July 29, 2007 and July 30, 2006, the notional values and unrealized gains or losses on commodity futures contracts held by the company were not material. The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of July 29, 2007. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable rate debt maturing in 2008 represent the weighted average rates at the period end. Interest rates disclosed on variable rate debt maturing in 2011 represent the weighted average forward rates for the term. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the weighted average forward rates for the term of each contract.

Table of Contents 19 As of July 30, 2006, fixed rate debt of approximately $2.5 billion with an average interest rate of 6.18% and variable rate debt of approximately $693 million with an average interest rate of 6.18% were outstanding. As of July 30, 2006, the company had swapped $875 million of fixed rate debt to variable. The average rate to be received on these swaps was 5.39% and the average rate paid was estimated to be 6.27% over the remaining life of the swaps. As of July 30, 2006, the company had also swapped $154 million of variable rate debt to fixed. The average rate estimated to be received on these swaps was 6.74% and the average rate to be paid was 6.73%. The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its international operations, including non functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The table below summarizes the cross currency swaps outstanding as of July 29, 2007, which hedge such exposures. The notional amount of each currency and the related weighted average forward interest rate are presented in the Cross Currency Swaps table.

The aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $548 million as of July 30, 2006, and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $144 million as of July 30, 2006. The following contracts were outstanding at July 30, 2006 related to intercompany financing of the divested United Kingdom and Ireland businesses: one pay variable GBP/receive variable USD swap with a notional value of $138 million and three pay fixed GBP/receive fixed USD swaps with notional values totaling $270 million. The aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $73 million as of July 30, 2006. These instruments were settled in August 2006 in connection with the sale of the businesses. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The table below summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of July 29, 2007. Forward Exchange Contracts Contract Average Contractual (millions) Amount Exchange Rate Receive USD/Pay CAD $ 49 1.12 Receive CAD/Pay USD $ 44 0.90 Receive AUD/Pay NZD $ 30 1.15 Receive USD/Pay EUR $ 25 0.73 Receive USD/Pay AUD $ 25 1.23 Receive EUR/Pay JPY $ 9 148.31 Receive GBP/Pay AUD $ 8 2.48 Receive EUR/Pay GBP $ 7 0.69 Receive EUR/Pay USD $ 6 1.33 Receive AUD/Pay USD $ 4 0.84 Receive JPY/Pay USD $ 4 0.01 The company had an additional $17 million in a number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Swedish krona, as of July 29, 2007. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $4 million as of July 29, 2007. The total forward exchange contracts outstanding, excluding contracts related to the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses, as of July 30, 2006 were $110 million with a fair value of a gain of $2 million. The forward exchange contracts related to the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses outstanding as of July 30, 2006, which were settled in August 2006 in connection with the sale, were $413 million and had an aggregate fair value of a loss of $5 million as of July 30, 2006. The company had swap contracts outstanding as of July 29, 2007, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return Table of Contents 20 of the Standard Poors 500 Index, the total return of the companys capital stock and the total return of the Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the Standard Poors 500 Index total return, the Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company capital stock. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard Poors 500 Index was $22 million at July 29, 2007 and $18 million at July 30, 2006. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2008, was 5.30% at July 29, 2007. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Puritan Fund was $13 million at July 29, 2007 and $10 million at July 30, 2006. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2008, was 5.54% at July 29, 2007. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on company capital stock was $29 million at July 29, 2007 and $27 million at July 30, 2006. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2008, was 5.50% at July 29, 2007. The fair value of these contracts was a $2 million loss at July 29, 2007 and a $2 million gain at July 30, 2006. The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities. Significant Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature price discounts, in store display incentives and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are classified as a reduction of revenue, involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates. Valuation of long lived assets Long lived assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other long lived asset impairment. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year. Table of Contents 21 Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $57 million in 2007, $77 million in 2006, and $67 million in 2005. Significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows: Pension 2007 2006 2005 Discount rate for benefit obligations 6.40 % 6.05 % 5.44 % Expected return on plan assets 8.81 % 8.71 % 8.76 % Postretirement Discount rate for obligations 6.50 % 6.25 % 5.50 % Initial health care trend rate 9.00 % 9.00 % 9.00 % Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $11 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $9 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million. Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the U.S. plans in 2007, 2006 and 2005, the company made a $22 million contribution in 2007 and a $35 million contribution in 2006 and 2005 to a U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements. Contributions to international plans were $10 million in 2007, $17 million in 2006 and $26 million in 2005. Subsequent to July 29, 2007, the company made a $35 million voluntary contribution to a U.S. plan in anticipation of future funding requirements. Contributions to non U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $9 million in 2008. As of July 29, 2007, the company adopted SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other comprehensive income. See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses. Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Tax reserves are established when, despite the companys belief that tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions are subject to challenge and the company may not successfully defend its position. These reserves, as well as the related interest, are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. While it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the company believes that the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See also the section entitled Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes, including the impact of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that must be met for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also addresses derecognition, recognition of related penalties and interest, classification of liabilities and disclosures of unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The company will adopt FIN 48 as of July 30, 2007 and will record the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 as a charge to fiscal 2008 opening retained earnings and accrued taxes. Interest recognized in accordance with FIN 48 may be classified in the financial statements as either income taxes or interest expense. Historically the company recorded interest on tax matters in interest expense and accrued interest. The company will record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense and accrued income taxes upon adoption of FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 will not have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or effective tax rate. Upon adoption, a cumulative effect adjustment of $6 million will be charged to retained earnings to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions. Table of Contents 22 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements, which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 157 establishes a definition of fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted. The company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 157. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose, at specific election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 159. Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results This Report contains forward looking statements that reflect the companys current expectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever possible, to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, will and similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements reflect the companys current plans and expectations and are based on information currently available to it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The company wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors and those important factors described in Part 1, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in the Securities and Exchange Commission filings of the company, could affect the companys actual results and could cause such results to vary materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company: the impact of strong competitive response to the companys efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation, promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in consumer demand for the companys products; the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives and new product introductions; the companys ability to achieve sales and earnings forecasts, which are based on assumptions about sales volume and product mix, and the impact of marketing and pricing actions; the companys ability to realize projected cost savings and benefits, including those contemplated by restructuring programs and other cost savings initiatives; the companys ability to successfully manage changes to its business processes, including selling, distribution, product capacity, information management systems and the integration of acquisitions; the increased significance of certain of the companys key trade customers; the impact of fluctuations in the supply and inflation in energy, raw and packaging materials cost; the risks associated with portfolio changes and completion of acquisitions and divestitures; the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in the companys Securities and Exchange Commission filings; the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates, interest rates, equity markets, inflation rates, economic conditions and other external factors; and the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the companys markets due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other calamities. This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the companys outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or intent to update forward looking statements made by the company in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date they are made.
