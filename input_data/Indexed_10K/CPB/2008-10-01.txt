The increase was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves in 2007 due to favorable results in litigation, a gain on the sale of the Papua New Guinea business in 2007 and an impairment charge in 2008 associated with the pending sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business sold under the Lesieur brand in France. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $3 million from $105 million in 2006 to $102 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves resulting from favorable results in litigation, mostly offset by higher incentive compensation expenses and higher expenses associated with the ongoing implementation of the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America. Interest Expense/Income Interest expense increased 2% in 2008 from 2007. The prior year included a $4 million reduction in interest related to the APA settlement. The remaining increase was due to a reduction in interest in 2007 related to the favorable settlement of U.S. federal income tax audits and lower capitalized interest, partially offset by lower debt 21 Table of Contents levels. Interest income declined to $8 million in 2008 from $19 million in 2007 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased 1% in 2007 from 2006. In 2007, the company recognized a $4 million reduction in interest associated with the APA settlement. In 2006, interest expense included a non cash reduction of $21 million related to a favorable tax settlement of a U.S. tax contingency. The remaining net reduction in 2007 was primarily due to lower debt levels and lower interest expense associated with tax matters, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest income increased to $19 million in 2007 from $15 million in 2006 due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents. Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 28.5% in 2008, 27.9% in 2007 and 24.0% in 2006. The following factors impacted the comparability of the tax rate in 2008 versus 2007: In 2008, the company recognized a tax benefit of $75 million on the $182 million pre tax restructuring charge and related costs. In 2008, the company recognized a $13 million benefit from the resolution of a state tax contingency. In 2007, the company recognized a $22 million benefit from the favorable settlement of the APA among the company, the United States and Canada related to royalties. In 2007, the company also recognized an additional net benefit of $40 million, following the finalization of the 2002 2004 U.S. federal tax audits. The increase in the rate from 2006 to 2007 was primarily attributable to lower tax settlement amounts and higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2007. The 2007 effective rate included a benefit of $22 million resulting from the favorable settlement of the APA and an additional net benefit of $40 million following the finalization of the 2002 2004 U.S. federal tax audits. The 2006 effective rate included a benefit of $47 million resulting from the favorable resolution of a U.S. tax contingency and a benefit of $21 million related to the favorable resolution of the 1996 2001 U.S. federal tax audits. After factoring in these items, the increase in the 2007 effective rate from 2006 was primarily due to higher taxes on foreign earnings. Restructuring Charges On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long term profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the companys management structure. As a result of these initiatives, the company expects to incur aggregate pre tax costs of approximately $230 million, consisting of the following: approximately $120 million associated with a loss on the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets; approximately $62 million in employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges; approximately $38 million in asset write offs and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment; and approximately $10 million in other exit costs. Of the aggregate $230 million of pre tax costs, the company expects approximately $65 million will be cash expenditures, the majority of which will be spent in 2009. The cash outflows related to these programs are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the companys liquidity. Annual pre tax benefits are expected to be approximately $15 $20 million beginning in 2009. In 2008, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 million ($102 million after tax or $.27 per share) related to these initiatives. The charge consisted of a net loss of $120 million ($64 million after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, $45 million ($31 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges. In addition, approximately $7 million ($5 million after tax or $.01 per share) of costs related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products sold, primarily representing accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment. The aggregate after tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs was $107 million, or $.28 per share. In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The transaction was completed on May 12, 22 Table of Contents 2008. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. In connection with this transaction, the company recognized a net loss of $120 million ($64 million after tax). The terms of the agreement require the company to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $9 million. The facility can be drawn down in AUD $5 million increments, six months and nine months after the closing date. Any borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. The company will also provide transition services for approximately one year. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produces primarily frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employs approximately 500 people. The company plans to operate the facility through April 2009 and transition production to its network of North American contract manufacturers and to its Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. As a result, the company recorded $20 million ($14 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $7 million ($5 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. The company expects to incur approximately $15 million in additional employee severance and benefit costs, approximately $19 million in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and approximately $6 million in other exit costs. In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company also announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia facility. The company plans to close the Miranda facility, which employs approximately 150 people, by the second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and $8 million ($6 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit costs. The company expects to incur an additional $2 million in accelerated depreciation of property, plant, and equipment, and approximately $4 million in other exit costs. As part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company also plans to streamline its management structure and eliminate certain overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and will be substantially completed in 2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $17 million ($11 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit costs. The company expects to incur approximately $2 million of additional employee severance and benefit costs. The total pre tax costs of $230 million expected to be incurred by segment are as follows: Baking and Snacking $151 million, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages $7 million, North America Foodservice $69 million, and $3 million to be allocated among all segments. The company incurred pre tax costs of approximately $182 million in 2008 by segment as follows: Baking and Snacking $144 million, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages $9 million and North America Foodservice $29 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The purchase price was subject to working capital and other post closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all years presented. This business was historically included in Other for segment reporting purposes. The company recognized a pre tax gain of $698 million ($462 million after tax or $1.21 per share) on the sale. The company used $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale to purchase company stock. 23 Table of Contents The results of the companys businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland sold in August 2006 are included in discontinued operations. Results of the businesses are summarized below: 2008 2007 2006 Godiva UK/Ireland Godiva Total UK/Ireland Godiva Total (Millions) Net sales $ 393 $ 16 $ 482 $ 498 $ 435 $ 449 $ 884 Earnings from operations before taxes $ 49 $ $ 50 $ 50 $ 90 $ 54 $ 144 Taxes on earnings operations (17 ) 7 (19 ) (12 ) (18 ) (19 ) (37 ) Gain on sale 698 39 39 Deferred tax expense/after tax costs associated with sale (61 ) (61 ) Tax impact of gain on sale (236 ) (15 ) (15 ) Earnings from discontinued operations $ 494 $ 31 $ 31 $ 62 $ 11 $ 35 $ 46 The 2007 results included a $24 million after tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The 2007 results also included a $7 million tax benefit from the favorable resolution of tax audits in the United Kingdom. The 2006 results included $56 million of deferred tax expense, which was recognized in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 93 17 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for a Parent Companys Excess Tax Basis in the Stock of a Subsidiary That is Accounted for as a Discontinued Operation. Results also included $7 million pre tax ($5 million after tax) of costs associated with the sale of the businesses. The company used $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company stock. The remaining net proceeds were used to settle foreign currency hedging contracts associated with intercompany financing transactions of the business, to pay taxes and expenses associated with the sale, and to repay debt. Liquidity and Capital Resources The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase shares and pay dividends, will be met through cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, long term borrowings under shelf registration statements and short term borrowings, including commercial paper. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled approximately $2.7 billion. This cash generating capability provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs. The company expects that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangements depend on the market conditions and the companys financial position at that time. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $766 million in 2008, compared to $674 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in payments to settle foreign currency hedging transactions and lower investments in working capital, partially offset by tax payments associated with the divestiture of Godiva. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $674 million in 2007, compared to $1,226 million in 2006. The reduction was due primarily to an increase in working capital in 2007 as compared to a decline in 2006 and payments of $186 million to settle hedging transactions, primarily related to foreign currency. Capital expenditures were $298 million in 2008, $334 million in 2007 and $309 million in 2006. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million in 2009. The increase in 2009 is primarily due to the previously announced expansion and enhancements of the companys corporate headquarters (approximately $40 million in total) and expansion of the U.S. beverage production capacity (approximately $60 million in total). Capital expenditures in 2008 included investments to expand the Pepperidge Farm bakery production capacity, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, expand the U.S. beverage production capacity, and expand the warehouse at the Maxton, North Carolina facility. Capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006 24 Table of Contents included investments to increase the manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups in a new facility, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, and implement certain productivity and quality projects in manufacturing facilities. Business acquired, as presented in the Statement of Cash Flows, represents the acquisition of the Wolfgang Puck soup business in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities includes $828 million of proceeds from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business and certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, net of cash divested. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 includes $906 million of proceeds from the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Papua New Guinea, net of cash divested. There were no new long term borrowings in 2008 and 2007. Long term borrowings in 2006 included the issuance of $202 million of five year variable rate debt in Australia due July 2011. The proceeds were used to repatriate earnings pursuant to the AJCA. While planning for the issuance of the debt, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the interest rate on $149 million of the debt prior to its issuance. Dividend payments were $329 million in 2008, $308 million in 2007 and $292 million in 2006. Annual dividends declared in 2008 were $.88 per share, $.80 per share in 2007 and $.72 per share in 2006. The 2008 fourth quarter rate was $.22 per share. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of $903 million during 2008. During fiscal 2008, the company purchased shares pursuant to two publicly announced share repurchase programs. Under the first program, which was announced on November 21, 2005, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of company stock through the end of fiscal 2008. The November 2005 program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Under the second program, which was announced on March 18, 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized using approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company stock. The March 2008 program was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Under a new program, which was announced on June 30, 2008 and will begin in fiscal 2009, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of fiscal 2011. In addition to the publicly announced share repurchase programs, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. The company expects to continue this practice in the future. Of the 2008 repurchases, approximately 23 million shares at a cost of $800 million were made pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 30 million shares at a cost of $1,140 million during 2007. Of the 2007 repurchases, approximately 21 million shares at a cost of $820 million were made pursuant to the companys then two publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. The first share repurchase program was the previously discussed Board of Directors authorization announced on November 21, 2005. Under the second share repurchase program, which was announced on August 15, 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized using up to $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company stock. The August 2006 program terminated at the end of fiscal 2007. See Market for Registrants Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for more information. At August 3, 2008, the company had $982 million of notes payable due within one year and $33 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company has a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility maturing in 2011, which was unused at August 3, 2008, except for $33 million of standby letters of credit. This agreement supports the companys commercial paper programs. As of August 3, 2008, the company had $300 million available for issuance under a $1 billion shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2002. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions. The June 2002 registration statement will expire in December 2008. 25 Table of Contents The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long term liabilities, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2010 2012 Total 2009 2011 2013 Thereafter (Millions) Debt obligations(1) $ 2,615 $ 982 $ 705 $ 401 $ 527 Interest payments(2) 545 117 185 99 144 Purchase commitments 1,218 1,020 145 28 25 Operating leases 204 40 65 48 51 Derivative and forward payments(3) 116 36 40 18 22 Uncertain tax positions(4) 2 2 Other long term liabilities(5) 150 15 28 22 85 Total long term cash obligations $ 4,850 $ 2,212 $ 1,168 $ 616 $ 854 (1) Includes capital lease obligations totaling $6 million, unamortized net premium on debt issuances, unamortized gain on a terminated interest rate swap, gain on cash flow interest rate swaps and a gain on fair value interest rate swaps. For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Interest payments for notes payable, long term debt and derivative instruments are calculated as follows. For notes payable, interest is based on par values and rates of contractually obligated issuances at fiscal year end. For fixed rate long term debt, interest is based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. Interest on fixed rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at fiscal year end. Interest on variable rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts contractually obligated at fiscal year end and rates estimated over the instruments life using forward interest rates plus applicable spreads. (3) Represents payments of cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts. (4) The company has an additional $59 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded in long term liabilities. The company is unable to reasonably estimate when settlement with the taxing authorities may occur. (5) Represents other long term liabilities, excluding deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits and minority interest. This table does not include postretirement benefits, payments related to pension plans or unvested stock based compensation. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 1,800 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $151 million. The companys 26 Table of Contents guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $9 million. The facility can be drawn down in AUD $5 million increments, six and nine months after the closing date, which was May 12, 2008. Any borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See also Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off balance sheet arrangements. Inflation In fiscal 2008, inflation, on average, has been significantly higher than previous years. The company uses a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies, commodity hedging and making capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations. Market Risk Sensitivity The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate and fixed rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable to total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 32% of 2008 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France and Germany. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short and long term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures contracts, as considered appropriate, to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities such as soybean oil, wheat, soybean meal, corn, cocoa and natural gas. The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August 3, 2008. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Table of Contents The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable rate debt maturing in 2009 represent the weighted average rates at the period end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity.

The aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $541 million as of July 29, 2007, and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $62 million as of July 29, 2007. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The table below summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of August 3, 2008. 29 Table of Contents Forward Exchange Contracts Contract Average Contractual Amount Exchange Rate (Millions) Receive USD/Pay EUR $ 47 0.67 Receive AUD/Pay USD $ 45 0.96 Receive USD/Pay CAD $ 41 1.01 Receive AUD/Pay NZD $ 13 1.15 Receive GBP/Pay AUD $ 12 2.13 Receive EUR/Pay USD $ 12 1.56 Receive CAD/Pay USD $ 10 0.98 The company had an additional $10 million in a number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Swedish krona, as of August 3, 2008.

The fair value of these contracts was a $1 million gain at August 3, 2008 and a $2 million loss at July 29, 2007. The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities. Significant Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature price discounts, in store display incentives and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are classified as a reduction of revenue, involves use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on 30 Table of Contents historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates. Valuation of long lived assets Long lived assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible asset impairment, while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess other long lived asset impairment. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $54 million in 2008, $57 million in 2007 and $77 million in 2006. The 2008 expense included $2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the Godiva divestiture, which was recorded in discontinued operations. The 2008 expense also included $4 million of special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives. Significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows: 2008 2007 2006 Pension Discount rate for benefit obligations 6.87 % 6.40 % 6.15 % Expected return on plan assets 8.60 % 8.79 % 8.81 % Postretirement Discount rate for obligations 7.00 % 6.50 % 6.25 % Initial health care trend rate 9.00 % 9.00 % 9.00 % Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $11 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million. Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the U.S. plans in 2008, 2007 and 2006, the company made voluntary contributions of $70 million in 2008, $22 million in 2007 and $35 million in 2006 to a U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements. Contributions to international plans were $8 million in 31 Table of Contents 2008, $10 million in 2007 and $17 million in 2006. The company does not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. plans in 2009. Contributions to non U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $9 million in 2009. As of July 29, 2007, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other comprehensive income. See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses. Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In 2008, the tax reserves are established in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2008. Upon adoption, the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $6 million as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, and a reduction in retained earnings. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, tax reserves were established to reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. As of August 3, 2008, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $61 million. See also Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.
