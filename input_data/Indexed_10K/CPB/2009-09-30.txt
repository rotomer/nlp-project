Earnings from continuing operations were $732 million in 2009 ($2.04 per share) and $671 million ($1.76 per share) in 2008. After factoring in the items impacting comparability, Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to lower interest expense, lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by the negative 15 Table of Contents impact of currency translation. After factoring in the items impacting comparability, Earnings per share from continuing operations increased due in part to the benefit from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The reduction was primarily due to share repurchases utilizing the net proceeds from the divestiture of the Godiva Chocolatier business and the companys strategic share repurchase programs. Earnings per share from continuing operations were negatively impacted by $.09 from currency translation in 2009. Earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million in 2009 represented an adjustment to the tax liability associated with the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business. Earnings from discontinued operations were $494 million in 2008 and included the $462 million gain from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business. Earnings per share from discontinued operations were $.01 in 2009 and $1.30 in 2008. The operations of Godiva contributed to earnings of $.08 per share in 2008. 2008 Net earnings were $1,165 million in 2008 ($3.06 per share) and $854 million ($2.16 per share) in 2007.

Earnings from continuing operations were $671 million in 2008 ($1.76 per share) and $792 million ($2.00 per share) in 2007. After factoring in the items impacting comparability, Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to higher sales, the impact of currency and the benefit of the 53rd week, partially offset by a reduction of gross margin as a percentage of sales and a higher effective tax rate. The additional week contributed approximately $.02 per share to Earnings from continuing operations in 2008. Earnings per share from continuing operations in 2008 also benefited from a reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Earnings from discontinued operations were $494 million in 2008 ($1.30 per share) and $62 million ($.16 per share) in 2007. After factoring items impacting comparability, earnings at Godiva increased slightly.

Within ready to serve, sales declined in the convenience platform, which includes soups in microwavable bowls and cups. In condensed, sales increased with growth in cooking and in eating varieties. The increase in broth sales was due to growth in aseptic varieties and the introduction of Swanson stock products.

Within condensed soup, gains in cooking varieties were offset by declines in eating varieties. In ready to serve, sales gains in Campbells Chunky and Campbells Select canned soups were partially offset by a decline in the convenience platform, which includes soups in microwavable bowls and cups. Condensed and ready to serve soups benefited from the lower sodium varieties. Swanson broth sales increased due to continued growth of aseptically packaged varieties. Excluding the impact of the 53rd week, beverage sales increased double digits, primarily due to consumer demand for healthy beverages. V8 vegetable juice, V8 V Fusion vegetable and fruit juice, and V8 Splash juice drinks contributed to the sales growth. Sales of Campbells tomato juice declined. Beverage sales benefited from expanded distribution of single serve beverages due to the distribution agreement for refrigerated single serve 18 Table of Contents beverages with The Coca Cola Company and Coca Cola Enterprises Inc. Sales of Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces increased. In 2009, Baking and Snacking sales decreased 10%.

Earnings in 2008 were also adversely impacted by cost inflation, partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity gains. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased $25 million from $132 million in 2008 to $107 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenses associated with the companys North American SAP implementation. Unallocated corporate expenses increased $30 million from $102 million in 2007 to $132 million in 2008. The increase was primarily due to the reversal of $20 million of legal reserves in 2007 due to favorable results in litigation, a gain on the sale of the Papua New Guinea business in 2007 and an impairment charge in 2008 associated with the pending sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business sold under the Lesieur brand in France. Interest Expense/Income Interest expense decreased to $110 million in 2009 from $167 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest income declined to $4 million in 2009 from $8 million in 2008 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense increased 2% in 2008 from 2007. The prior year included a $4 million reduction in interest related to the APA settlement. The remaining increase was due to a reduction in interest in 2007 related to the favorable settlement of U.S. federal income tax audits and lower capitalized interest, partially offset by lower debt levels. Interest income declined to $8 million in 2008 from $19 million in 2007 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents. Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 32.2% in 2009, 28.5% in 2008 and 27.9% in 2007. The following factors impacted the comparability of the tax rate in 2009 versus 2008: In 2009, the company recognized an $11 million benefit following the finalization of tax audits. In 2008, the company recognized a tax benefit of $75 million on the $182 million pre tax restructuring charge and related costs. In 2008, the company recognized a $13 million benefit from the resolution of a state tax contingency. The effective rate increased in 2009 from 2008 reflecting additional tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. The 2008 effective rate reflects a benefit for tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions. In 2007, the effective rate was impacted by a $22 million benefit from the favorable settlement of the APA among the company, the United States and Canada related to royalties. In 2007, the company also recognized an additional net benefit of $40 million, following the finalization of the 2002 2004 U.S. federal tax audits. After factoring in the items impacting comparability in 2008 and 2007, the effective rate declined in 2008 due in part to a benefit related to tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions. Restructuring Charges On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long term profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the companys management structure. As a result of these initiatives, in 2008, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 million ($102 million after tax or $.27 per share). The charge consisted of a net loss of $120 million ($64 million after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, $45 million ($31 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges. In addition, approximately $7 million ($5 million after 22 Table of Contents tax or $.01 per share) of costs related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products sold, primarily representing accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment. The aggregate after tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs in 2008 was $107 million, or $.28 per share. In 2009, the company recorded approximately $22 million ($15 million after tax or $.04 per share) of costs related to these initiatives in Cost of products sold. Approximately $17 million of the costs represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment, approximately $4 million related to other exit costs and approximately $1 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, including other pension charges. The company expects to incur additional pre tax costs of approximately $12 million in benefit costs related to pension charges. Of the aggregate $216 million of pre tax costs for the total program, the company expects approximately $40 million will be cash expenditures, the majority of which was spent in 2009. Annual pre tax benefits are expected to be approximately $15 $20 million beginning in 2009. In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The transaction was completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. In connection with this transaction, the company recognized a net loss of $120 million ($64 million after tax) in 2008. The terms of the agreement required the company to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $7 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produced primarily frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employed approximately 500 people. The company closed the facility in April 2009. Production was transitioned to its network of North American contract manufacturers and to its Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. The company recorded $20 million ($14 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $7 million ($5 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 million of employee severance and benefit costs, including other pension charges, $16 million ($11 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and $2 million ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs. The company expects to incur approximately $12 million in benefit costs related to pension charges. In April 2008, as part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company also announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia facility. The company closed the Miranda facility, which employed approximately 150 people, in the second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and $8 million ($6 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit costs in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 million in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and $2 million ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs. As part of the previously discussed initiatives, the company streamlined its management structure and eliminated certain overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and were substantially completed in 2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $17 million ($11 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit costs in 2008. In aggregate, the company incurred pre tax costs of approximately $204 million in 2008 and in 2009 by segment as follows: Baking and Snacking $147 million, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages $9 million and North America Foodservice $48 million. Additional pre tax costs of $12 million are expected to be incurred in the North America Foodservice segment for benefit costs related to estimated pension charges. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The purchase price was subject to working 23 Table of Contents capital and other post closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. The company used $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale to purchase company stock. In fiscal 2008, the company recognized a pre tax gain of $698 million ($462 million after tax or $1.21 per share) on the sale. In fiscal 2009, the company recognized a $4 million tax benefit as a result of an adjustment to the tax liability associated with the sale. On August 15, 2006, the company completed the sale of its businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland for 460, or approximately $870 million. The purchase price was subject to certain post closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $19 million of proceeds. The results of the companys businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland are included in discontinued operations. The 2007 results included a $24 million after tax gain, or $.06 per share, on the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The 2007 results also included a $7 million tax benefit from the favorable resolution of tax audits in the United Kingdom. The company used $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company stock. The remaining net proceeds were used to settle foreign currency hedging contracts associated with intercompany financing transactions of the business, to pay taxes and expenses associated with the sale, and to repay debt. Results of the businesses are summarized below: 2009 2008 2007 Godiva Godiva UK/Ireland Godiva Total (Millions) Net sales $ $ 393 $ 16 $ 482 $ 498 Earnings from operations before taxes $ $ 49 $ $ 50 $ 50 Taxes on earnings operations (17 ) 7 (19 ) (12 ) Gain on sale 698 39 39 Tax impact from sale of businesses 4 (236 ) (15 ) (15 ) Earnings from discontinued operations $ 4 $ 494 $ 31 $ 31 $ 62 Liquidity and Capital Resources The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase shares, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will be met through cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operations, long term borrowings under shelf registration statements and short term borrowings, including commercial paper. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled approximately $2.6 billion. This cash generating capability provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs. The company expects that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangements may be negatively impacted by capital and credit market disruptions and will depend on the market conditions and the companys financial position at the time. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $1,166 million in 2009, compared to $766 million in 2008 due to higher cash earnings and lower tax payments. In 2008, net cash flows from operations included tax payments associated with the divestiture of Godiva. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $766 million in 2008, compared to $674 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in payments to settle foreign currency hedging transactions and lower investments in working capital, partially offset by tax payments associated with the divestiture of Godiva. Capital expenditures were $345 million in 2009, $298 million in 2008 and $334 million in 2007. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million in 2010. Capital expenditures in 2009 included expansion of the U.S. beverage production capacity (approximately $54 million) and expansion and enhancements of the companys corporate headquarters (approximately $20 million). Capital expenditures in 2008 included investments to expand the Pepperidge Farm bakery production capacity, implement the SAP enterprise resource 24 Table of Contents planning system in North America, expand the U.S. beverage production capacity, and expand the warehouse at the Maxton, North Carolina facility. Capital expenditures in 2007 included investments to increase the manufacturing capacity for refrigerated soups in a new facility, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, and implement certain productivity and quality projects in manufacturing facilities. Business acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows, represents the acquisition of the Ecce Panis, Inc. business in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the Wolfgang Puck soup business in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2009 includes $38 million of proceeds from the sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business in France, net of cash divested. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2008 includes $828 million of proceeds from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business and certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, net of cash divested. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 includes $906 million of proceeds from the sale of the businesses in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Papua New Guinea, net of cash divested. Long term borrowings in 2009 included the issuance in January of $300 million of 4.5% notes that mature in February 2019 and the issuance in July of $300 million of 3.375% notes that mature in August 2014. The net proceeds from these issuances were used for the repayment of commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. There were no new long term borrowings in 2008 and 2007. Dividend payments were $350 million in 2009, $329 million in 2008 and $308 million in 2007. Annual dividends declared in 2009 were $1.00 per share, $.88 per share in 2008 and $.80 per share in 2007. The 2009 fourth quarter rate was $.25 per share. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 17 million shares at a cost of $527 million during 2009. The majority of these shares were repurchased pursuant to the companys June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program. Under this program, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of fiscal 2011. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. The company expects to continue this practice in the future. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of $903 million during 2008. During fiscal 2008, the company purchased shares pursuant to two publicly announced share repurchase programs. Under the first program, which was announced on November 21, 2005, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of company stock through the end of fiscal 2008. The November 2005 program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Under the second program, which was announced on March 18, 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized using approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company stock. The March 2008 program was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition to the publicly announced share repurchase programs, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Of the 2008 repurchases, approximately 23 million shares at a cost of $800 million were made pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 30 million shares at a cost of $1,140 million during 2007. Of the 2007 repurchases, approximately 21 million shares at a cost of $820 million were made pursuant to the companys then two publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. The first share repurchase program was the previously discussed Board of Directors authorization announced on November 21, 2005. Under the second share repurchase program, which was announced on August 15, 2006, the companys Board of Directors authorized using up to $620 million of the net proceeds from the sale of United Kingdom and Ireland businesses to purchase company stock. The August 2006 program terminated at the end of fiscal 2007. See Market for Registrants Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for more information. 25 Table of Contents At August 2, 2009, the company had $378 million of notes payable due within one year and $27 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company has a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility maturing in 2011, which was unused at August 2, 2009, except for $27 million of standby letters of credit. This agreement supports the companys commercial paper programs. In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions. The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long term liabilities, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2011 2013 Total 2010 2012 2014 Thereafter (Millions) Debt obligations(1) $ 2,581 $ 378 $ 703 $ 700 $ 800 Interest payments(2) 564 114 158 110 182 Purchase commitments 1,072 946 78 18 30 Operating leases 236 46 77 56 57 Derivative and forward payments(3) 40 13 9 18 Other long term liabilities(4) 153 16 30 20 87 Total long term cash obligations $ 4,646 $ 1,513 $ 1,055 $ 922 $ 1,156 (1) Excludes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances, unamortized gain on a terminated interest rate swap and amounts related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Interest payments for notes payable, long term debt and derivative instruments are calculated as follows. For notes payable, interest is based on par values and rates of contractually obligated issuances at fiscal year end. For fixed rate long term debt, interest is based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. Interest on fixed rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at fiscal year end. Interest on variable rate derivative instruments is based on notional amounts contractually obligated at fiscal year end and rates estimated over the instruments life using forward interest rates plus applicable spreads. (3) Represents payments of cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts. (4) Represents other long term liabilities, excluding deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, minority interest, postretirement benefits, payments related to pension plans and unvested stock based compensation. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 1,900 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $159 million. The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $7 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See also Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off balance sheet arrangements. Inflation In fiscal 2008 and 2009, inflation, on average, has been significantly higher than recent years. The company uses a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies, commodity hedging and making capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations. Market Risk Sensitivity The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate and fixed rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable to total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 27% of 2009 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France and Germany. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short and long term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures and option contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of natural gas, diesel fuel, wheat, soybean oil, cocoa, aluminum and corn which impact the cost of raw materials. The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August 2, 2009. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 11 through 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Table of Contents The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable rate debt maturing in 2010 represent the weighted average rates at the period end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity.

The aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $699 million as of August 3, 2008, and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $117 million as of August 3, 2008. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The table below summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of August 2, 2009.

The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $10 million as of August 2, 2009. The total forward exchange contracts outstanding as of August 3, 2008 were $190 million with a fair value gain of $1 million. The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. The notional value of these contracts was $51 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was not material as of August 2, 2009. The total notional value of these contracts was $146 million and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $3 million as of August 3, 2008. The company had swap contracts outstanding as of August 2, 2009, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the Standard Poors 500 Index, the total return of the companys capital stock and the total return of the Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the Standard Poors 500 Index total return, the Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company capital stock. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard Poors 500 Index was $8 million at August 2, 2009 and $16 million at August 3, 2008. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2010, was 0.78% at August 2, 2009. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Puritan Fund was $6 million at August 2, 2009 and $9 million at August 3, 2008.

The fair value of these contracts was a $4 million gain at August 2, 2009 and $1 million gain at August 3, 2008. The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities. Significant Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature price discounts, in store display incentives and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are classified as a reduction of revenue, involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates. Valuation of long lived assets Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment, or as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted 30 Table of Contents average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As of August 2, 2009, the carrying value of goodwill was $1.901 billion. The company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the 2009 measurement, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 30%. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2009 measurement constant, a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the asset is reduced to fair value. In 2009, as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $67 million was recognized related to certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and the Nordic region, used in the International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year. The reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital. As of August 2, 2009, the carrying value of trademarks was $508 million. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2009 measurement constant, the estimated impact of a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would be a reduction in the carrying value of trademarks of approximately $10 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. However, inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the companys control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $53 million in 2009, $54 million in 2008 and $57 million in 2007. The 2008 expense included $2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the Godiva divestiture, which was recorded in discontinued operations. The 2008 expense also included $4 million of 31 Table of Contents special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives. Significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows: 2009 2008 2007 Pension Discount rate for benefit obligations 6.00 % 6.87 % 6.40 % Expected return on plan assets 8.13 % 8.60 % 8.79 % Postretirement Discount rate for obligations 6.00 % 7.00 % 6.50 % Initial health care trend rate 8.25 % 9.00 % 9.00 % Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $13 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $11 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately $80 million in 2010 primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations, a significant decline in the fair value of plan assets and a reduction in the expected return on plan assets. Although there were no mandatory funding requirements to the U.S. plans in 2009, 2008 and 2007, the company made voluntary contributions of $70 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2007 to a U.S. plan based on expected future funding requirements. Contributions to international plans were $13 million in 2009, $8 million in 2008 and $10 million in 2007. Given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans, the company contributed $260 million to a U.S. plan in the first quarter of 2010. Contributions to non U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $18 million in 2010. As of July 29, 2007, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and requires any unrecognized prior service cost and actuarial gains/losses to be recognized in other comprehensive income. See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses. Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Beginning in 2008, the tax reserves are established in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which was adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2008. Upon adoption, the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $6 million as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, and a reduction in retained earnings. Prior to the adoption of FIN 48, tax reserves were established to reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. As of August 2, 2009, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $50 million. 32 Table of Contents See also Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) Business Combinations, which establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires acquisition related transaction costs to be expensed as incurred rather than capitalized as a component of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 141(R) 1 Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies. SFAS No. 141(R) and FSP FAS 141(R) 1 apply to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. The company will adopt SFAS 141(R) as revised for any business combinations entered into in fiscal 2010 and thereafter. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be recorded as equity in the consolidated financial statements. This Statement also requires that consolidated net income shall be adjusted to include the net income attributed to the noncontrolling interest. Disclosure on the face of the income statement of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest is required. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. The company will adopt SFAS No. 160 in first quarter of fiscal 2010. The company does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 03 6 1 Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. FSP EITF 03 6 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data (including any amounts related to interim periods, summaries of earnings and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of FSP EITF 03 6 1. The company will adopt FSP EITF 03 6 1 in fiscal 2010 and all prior period earnings per share data will be restated. Upon adoption, the company expects the following reduction in basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008: 2009 2008 Basic Diluted Basic Diluted Continuing operations $ (.03 ) $ (.01 ) $ (.03 ) $ (.01 ) Net earnings $ (.03 ) $ (.01 ) $ (.06 ) $ (.03 ) In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 132(R) 1 Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, which provides additional guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The disclosures required by FSP FAS 132(R) 1 include a description of how investment allocation decisions are made, major categories of plan assets, valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, the impact of measurements using significant unobservable inputs and concentrations of risk within plan assets. The disclosures about plan assets required by this FSP shall be provided for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. FSP FAS 132(R) 1 will be effective for the company for fiscal year end 2010 and will result in additional disclosures. In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 107 1 and Accounting Principles Board (APB) 28 1 Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods and amends APB Opinion No. 28 Interim Financial Reporting to require those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The FSP is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. 33 Table of Contents The FSP does not require disclosures for earlier periods presented for comparative purposes at initial adoption. The company will adopt the disclosure requirements in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168 The FASB Accounting Standards Codificationtm and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 162. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) will become the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this Statement, the Codification will supersede all then existing non SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other nongrandfathered non SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification will become nonauthoritative. This Statement is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 168 is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.
