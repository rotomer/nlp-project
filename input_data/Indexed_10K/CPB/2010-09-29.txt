Campbells overarching business strategy is to drive profitable growth by focusing on three large and growing categories simple meals, baked snacks, and healthy beverages in geographies where it has strong brands, leading share positions and regional scale. Most of the companys sales currently are attributable to the United States, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Belgium.

The company intends to enhance the growth of its healthy beverages and baked snacks portfolio of businesses through increased innovation and marketing support. The company also expects to grow its simple meal businesses by increasing its focus on meal makers, which are ingredients and components used to make a meal, such as broth, sauces and cooking soups, while continuing investments behind its condensed eating and ready to serve soups. Deliver higher levels of consumer satisfaction through superior innovation focused on wellness while providing good value, quality and convenience. Consumers are seeking and will continue to seek products with a strong value orientation and with health and wellness benefits. Campbell is pursuing initiatives designed to address these consumer trends and to drive strong levels of consumer satisfaction. For example, in fiscal 2011, building on the success of the V8 V Fusion juice offerings, the company will introduce a number of new V8 V Fusion Plus Tea products. In the baked snacks category, the company plans to continue upgrading the health credentials of its cracker (or savory biscuit) offerings. Responding to the consumers value oriented focus, Campbells condensed soups will be relaunched with a new contemporary packaging design and an upgrade to the companys gravity fed shelving system. In the ready to serve soup portfolio, a number of the companys offerings in the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Belgium and Australia will be enhanced. Finally, all of the companys Campbells branded U.S. soups will benefit from a unified advertising campaign focusing on the taste and nutritional attributes of the companys soup products. Make the companys products more broadly available and relevant in existing and new markets, consumer segments and eating occasions. Campbell will pursue strategies designed to expand the availability and relevance of its products in existing and new markets, including new consumer segments and eating occasions.

Earnings from continuing operations were $844 million in 2010 ($2.42 per share) and $732 million ($2.03 per share) in 2009. After adjusting for the items impacting comparability, Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to improved gross margin performance and the impact of currency, partially offset by lower sales volume. Earnings per share from continuing operations benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which was primarily due to share repurchases under the companys strategic share repurchase program. Earnings from discontinued operations of $4 million in 2009 represented an adjustment to the tax liability associated with the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business. Earnings from Continuing and Discontinued Operations 2009 Compared with 2008 Net earnings were $736 million in 2009 ($2.05 per share) and $1,165 million ($3.03 per share) in 2008.

Earnings from continuing operations were $732 million in 2009 ($2.03 per share) and $671 million ($1.75 per share) in 2008. After adjusting for the items impacting comparability, Earnings from continuing operations increased primarily due to lower interest expense, lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. Earnings per share from continuing operations benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The reduction was primarily due to share repurchases utilizing the net proceeds from the divestiture of the Godiva Chocolatier business and the companys strategic share repurchase programs.

Basis of Presentation There were 52 weeks in fiscal 2010 and 2009, and 53 weeks in fiscal 2008. In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance related to the calculation of earnings per share. The guidance provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method. The two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The company adopted and retrospectively applied the new guidance in the first quarter of 2010. The retrospective application of the provision resulted in the following reductions to basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008: 2009 2008 Basic Diluted Basic Diluted Continuing operations $ (.03 ) $ (.01 ) $ (.03 ) $ (.01 ) Net earnings $ (.03 ) $ (.01 ) $ (.06 ) $ (.03 ) 16 Table of Contents See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Interest income increased to $6 million in 2010 from $4 million in 2009 primarily due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense decreased to $110 million in 2009 from $167 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest income declined to $4 million in 2009 from $8 million in 2008 primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents. Taxes on Earnings The effective tax rate was 32.0% in 2010, 32.2% in 2009, and 28.5% in 2008.

Restructuring Charges On April 28, 2008, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long term profitability, including selling certain salty snack food brands and assets in Australia, closing certain production facilities in Australia and Canada, and streamlining the companys management structure. As a result of these initiatives, in 2008, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $175 million ($102 million after tax or $.27 per share). The charge consisted of a net loss of $120 million ($64 million after tax) on the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, $45 million ($31 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges. In addition, approximately $7 million ($5 million after tax or $.01 per share) of costs related to these initiatives were recorded in Cost of products sold, primarily representing accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment. The aggregate after tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs in 2008 was $107 million, or $.28 per share. In 2009, the company recorded approximately $22 million ($15 million after tax or $.04 per share) of costs related to the 2008 initiatives in Cost of products sold. Approximately $17 million ($12 million after tax) of the costs represented accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment; approximately $4 million ($2 million after tax) related to other exit costs; and approximately $1 million related to employee severance and benefit costs, including other pension charges. In 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million ($8 million after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs associated with the 2008 initiatives. 22 Table of Contents Details of the components of the initiatives are as follows: In the third quarter of 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company entered into an agreement to sell certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets. The transaction was completed on May 12, 2008. Proceeds of the sale were nominal. In connection with this transaction, the company recognized a net loss of $120 million ($64 million after tax) in 2008. The terms of the agreement required the company to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $9 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See also Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company announced plans to close the Listowel, Ontario, Canada food plant. The Listowel facility produced primarily frozen products, including soup, entrees, and Pepperidge Farm products, as well as ramen noodles. The facility employed approximately 500 people. The company closed the facility in April 2009. Production was transitioned to its network of North American contract manufacturers and to its Downingtown, Pennsylvania plant. The company recorded $20 million ($14 million after tax) of employee severance and benefit costs, including the estimated impact of curtailment and other pension charges, and $7 million ($5 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 million of employee severance and benefit costs, including other pension charges, $16 million ($11 million after tax) in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and $2 million ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs. In 2010, the company recorded $12 million ($8 million after tax) for pension benefit costs, which represented the final costs associated with the initiatives. In April 2008, as part of the initiatives, the company also announced plans to discontinue the private label biscuit and industrial chocolate production at its Miranda, Australia facility. The company closed the Miranda facility, which employed approximately 150 people, in the second quarter of 2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $10 million ($7 million after tax) of property, plant and equipment impairment charges and $8 million ($6 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit costs in 2008. In 2009, the company recorded $1 million in accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment and $2 million ($1 million after tax) of other exit costs. As part of the 2008 initiatives, the company streamlined its management structure and eliminated certain overhead costs. These actions began in the fourth quarter of 2008 and were substantially completed in 2009. In connection with this action, the company recorded $17 million ($11 million after tax) in employee severance and benefit costs in 2008. In aggregate, the company incurred pre tax costs of approximately $216 million in 2008 through 2010 by segment as follows: Baking and Snacking $147 million, International Soup, Sauces and Beverages $9 million and North America Foodservice $60 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discontinued Operations On March 18, 2008, the company completed the sale of its Godiva Chocolatier business for $850 million, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 20, 2007. The purchase price was subject to working capital and other post closing adjustments, which resulted in an additional $20 million of proceeds. The company has reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings. The company used $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale to purchase company stock. In fiscal 2008, the company recognized a pre tax gain of $698 million ($462 million after tax or $1.20 per share) on the sale. In fiscal 2009, the company recognized a $4 million tax benefit as a result of an adjustment to the tax liability associated with the sale. 23 Table of Contents Results of the operations of the Godiva Chocolatier business are summarized below: 2009 2008 (Millions) Net sales $ $ 393 Earnings from operations before taxes $ $ 49 Taxes on earnings operations (17 ) Gain on sale 698 Tax impact from sale of business 4 (236 ) Earnings from discontinued operations $ 4 $ 494 Liquidity and Capital Resources The company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including cash outflows to repurchase shares, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long term borrowings under its shelf registration statement; short term borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash equivalents. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled approximately $3 billion. This cash generating capability provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs. The company expects that its sources of financing are adequate to meet its future liquidity and capital resource requirements. The cost and terms of any future financing arrangements may be negatively impacted by capital and credit market disruptions and will depend on the market conditions and the companys financial position at the time. The company generated cash from operations of $1.057 billion in 2010, compared to $1.166 billion last year. The decline was primarily due to a $260 million contribution to a U.S. pension plan in 2010, partially offset by improvements in working capital requirements. Net cash flows from operating activities provided $1.166 billion in 2009, compared to $766 million in 2008. The increase was due to higher cash earnings and lower tax payments. In 2008, net cash flows from operations included tax payments associated with the divestiture of Godiva. Capital expenditures were $315 million in 2010, $345 million in 2009, and $298 million in 2008. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $300 million in 2011. Capital expenditures in 2010 included expansion and enhancements of the companys corporate headquarters (approximately $36 million), expansion of Arnotts production capacity (approximately $21 million), the ongoing implementation of SAP in Australia and New Zealand (approximately $15 million) and expansion of Pepperidge Farms production capacity (approximately $14 million). Capital expenditures in 2009 included expansion of the U.S. beverage production capacity (approximately $54 million) and expansion and enhancements of the companys corporate headquarters (approximately $20 million). Capital expenditures in 2008 included investments to expand the Pepperidge Farm bakery production capacity, implement the SAP enterprise resource planning system in North America, expand the U.S. beverage production capacity, and expand the warehouse at the Maxton, North Carolina facility. Business acquired, as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows, represented the acquisition of the Ecce Panis, Inc. business in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the Wolfgang Puck soup business in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2009 included $38 million of proceeds from the sale of the sauce and mayonnaise business in France, net of cash divested. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2008 included $828 million of proceeds from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business and certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, net of cash divested. Long term borrowings in 2010 included the issuance in July of $400 million of 3.05% notes that mature in July 2017. Long term borrowings in 2009 included the issuance in January of $300 million of 4.5% notes that mature in February 2019 and the issuance in July of $300 million of 3.375% notes that mature in August 2014. The net proceeds from these issuances were used for the repayment of commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. There were no new long term borrowings in 2008. 24 Table of Contents Dividend payments were $365 million in 2010, $350 million in 2009, and $329 million in 2008. Annual dividends declared in 2010 were $1.075 per share, $1.00 per share in 2009, and $.88 per share in 2008. The 2010 fourth quarter rate was $.275 per share. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares and for stock option exercises, the company repurchased 14 million shares at a cost of $472 million during 2010. Approximately 7 million of the shares repurchased in 2010 were repurchased pursuant to the companys June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program. Under this program, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of company stock through the end of fiscal 2011. Approximately $550 million remained available under the June 2008 repurchase program as of August 1, 2010. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. The company expects to continue this practice in the future. See Market for Registrants Capital Stock, Related Shareowner Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for more information. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 17 million shares at a cost of $527 million during 2009. Approximately 13 million of the shares repurchased in 2009 were repurchased pursuant to the companys June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares, the company repurchased 26 million shares at a cost of $903 million during 2008. During fiscal 2008, the company purchased shares pursuant to two publicly announced share repurchase programs. Under the first program, which was announced on November 21, 2005, the companys Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $600 million of company stock through the end of fiscal 2008. The November 2005 program was completed during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. Under the second program, which was announced on March 18, 2008, the companys Board of Directors authorized using approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Godiva Chocolatier business to purchase company stock. The March 2008 program was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition to the publicly announced share repurchase programs, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Of the 2008 repurchases, approximately 23 million shares at a cost of $800 million were made pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs. The remaining shares were repurchased to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. At August 1, 2010, the company had $835 million of short term borrowings due within one year and $25 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. The company had a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit facility maturing in September 2011, which was unused at August 1, 2010, except for $25 million of standby letters of credit. In September 2010, the company entered into a $975 million committed 364 day revolving credit facility that contains a one year term out feature. The company also entered into a $975 million revolving credit facility that matures in September 2013. These facilities replaced the existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. These agreements support the companys commercial paper programs. In November 2008, the company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions. The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities. Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations. For additional information on debt, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial 25 Table of Contents Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long term liabilities, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2012 2014 Total 2011 2013 2015 Thereafter (Millions) Debt obligations(1) $ 2,734 $ 832 $ 402 $ 600 $ 900 Interest payments(2) 552 114 164 100 174 Purchase commitments 920 539 164 65 152 Operating leases 186 43 63 38 42 Derivative and forward payments(3) 74 19 29 26 Other long term liabilities(4) 160 18 32 22 88 Total long term cash obligations $ 4,626 $ 1,565 $ 854 $ 851 $ 1,356 (1) Excludes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances, unamortized gain on a terminated interest rate swap and amounts related to interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges. For additional information on debt obligations, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Interest payments for short term borrowings and long term debt are calculated as follows. For short term borrowings, interest is based on par values and rates of contractually obligated issuances at fiscal year end. For long term debt, interest is based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end. (3) Represents payments of cross currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, and deferred compensation hedges. (4) Represents other long term liabilities, excluding unrecognized tax benefits, postretirement benefits, payments related to pension plans and unvested stock based compensation. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 1,900 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $161 million. The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. In connection with the sale of certain Australian salty snack food brands and assets, the company agreed to provide a loan facility to the buyer of AUD $10 million, or approximately USD $9 million. The facility was drawn down in AUD $5 million increments in 2009. Borrowings under the facility are to be repaid five years after the closing date. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off balance sheet arrangements. Inflation In fiscal 2008 and 2009, inflation, on average, had been significantly higher than in the years preceding 2008, and was primarily reflected in Cost of products sold. In 2010, inflation was not as significant. The company uses a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation. These strategies include increasing prices, pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies, commodity hedging and making capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations. 26 Table of Contents Market Risk Sensitivity The principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate and fixed rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable to total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 29% of 2010 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Belgium. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross currency swaps and forward contracts. Swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short and long term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures and option contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, natural gas, soybean oil, aluminum, sugar, cocoa, and corn, which impact the cost of raw materials. The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August 1, 2010. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13 through 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable rate debt maturing in 2010 represent the weighted average rates at the period end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the weighted average forward rates for the term of each contract.

As of August 2, 2009, fixed rate debt of approximately $2.2 billion with an average interest rate of 5.50% and variable rate debt of approximately $374 million with an average interest rate of 0.58% were outstanding. As of August 2, 2009, the company had swapped $500 million of fixed rate debt to variable. The average rate to be 27 Table of Contents received on these swaps was 4.95% and the average rate paid was estimated to be 2.81% over the remaining life of the swaps. The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its international operations, including non functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The following table summarizes the cross currency swaps outstanding as of August 1, 2010, which hedge such exposures. The notional amount of each currency and the related weighted average forward interest rate are presented in the Cross Currency Swaps table.

The aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $719 million as of August 2, 2009, and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $35 million as of August 2, 2009. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of August 1, 2010. 28 Table of Contents Forward Exchange Contracts Average Contractual Exchange Rate Contract (Currency Paid/ Amount Currency Received) (Millions) Receive USD/Pay CAD $ 137 1.03 Receive CAD/Pay USD $ 45 0.97 Receive AUD/Pay NZD $ 25 1.23 Receive EUR/Pay SEK $ 20 9.46 Receive USD/Pay AUD $ 20 1.15 Receive GBP/Pay AUD $ 10 1.76 The company had an additional $14 million in a number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, euro, and Japanese yen, as of August 1, 2010. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was not material as of August 1, 2010. The total forward exchange contracts outstanding as of August 2, 2009 were $405 million with a fair value loss of $10 million. The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. The notional value of these contracts was $50 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $3 million as of August 1, 2010. The total notional value of these contracts was $51 million and the aggregate fair value was not material as of August 2, 2009. The company had swap contracts outstanding as of August 1, 2010, which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the Standard Poors 500 Index, the total return of the companys capital stock and the total return of the Puritan Fund. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the Standard Poors 500 Index total return, the Puritan Fund total return, or the total return on company capital stock. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard Poors 500 Index was $12 million at August 1, 2010 and $8 million at August 2, 2009. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2011, was 0.84% at August 1, 2010. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Puritan Fund was $9 million at August 1, 2010 and $6 million at August 2, 2009. The average forward interest rate applicable to the contract, which expires in 2011, was 1.39% at August 1, 2010. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on company capital stock was $54 million at August 1, 2010 and $34 million at August 2, 2009. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2011, was 1.25% at August 1, 2010. The fair value of these contracts was a $2 million loss at August 1, 2010 and a $4 million gain at August 2, 2009. The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities. Significant Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as cooperative advertising programs, feature price discounts, in store display incentives and coupons. The recognition of the costs for these programs, which are classified as a reduction of revenue, involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based 29 Table of Contents on historical experience and other factors. Actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance vary from estimates. Valuation of long lived assets Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment, or as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment testing first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As of August 1, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill was $1.919 billion. The company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the 2010 measurement, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 80%. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2010 measurement constant, a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value. As of August 1, 2010, the carrying value of trademarks was $496 million. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2010 measurement constant, a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately $13 million. In 2009, as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $67 million was recognized related to certain European trademarks, primarily in Germany and the Nordic region, used in the International Soup, Sauces and Beverages segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for discounted cash flows in comparison to prior year. The reduction was due in part to a deterioration in market conditions and an increase in the weighted average cost of capital. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning. However, inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the companys control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit 30 Table of Contents payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $92 million in 2010, $53 million in 2009, and $54 million in 2008. The 2010 expense included $12 million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in Canada. The 2008 expense included $2 million of special termination benefits and curtailment costs related to the Godiva divestiture, which was recorded in discontinued operations. The 2008 expense also included $4 million of special termination and curtailment costs related to the restructuring initiatives. Significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year are as follows: 2010 2009 2008 Pension Discount rate for benefit obligations 5.46 % 6.00 % 6.87 % Expected return on plan assets 8.15 % 8.13 % 8.60 % Postretirement Discount rate for obligations 5.25 % 6.00 % 7.00 % Initial health care trend rate 8.25 % 8.25 % 9.00 % Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.50 % Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $12 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately $100 million in 2011 primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate for benefit obligations and increased amortization of unrecognized losses. Given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans, the company contributed $260 million to a U.S. plan in 2010. The company made a voluntary contribution of $70 million in 2008 to a U.S. plan. Contributions to international plans were $24 million in 2010, $13 million in 2009, and $8 million in 2008. The company contributed $100 million to U.S. plans in the first quarter of 2011. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not expected in 2011. Contributions to non U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $43 million in 2011. See also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses. Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. 31 Table of Contents At the beginning of fiscal 2008, the company adopted revised accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. Upon adoption, the company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $6 million as an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, and a reduction in retained earnings. Prior to the adoption, tax reserves were established to reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. As of August 1, 2010, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $45 million. See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In addition to the guidance related to the calculation of earnings per share described in Basis of Presentation and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, recent accounting pronouncements are as follows: In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. It requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, which was formerly known as minority interest, to be classified as a separate component of total equity in the consolidated financial statements. The company retrospectively adopted the new noncontrolling interest guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on the financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In January 2010, the FASB issued additional authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of details of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. Level 1 fair value measurements are based on unadjusted quoted market prices. Level 2 fair value measurements are based on significant inputs, other than Level 1, that are observable for the asset/liability through corroboration with observable market data. The guidance also clarifies the existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements and the disclosures on inputs and valuation techniques. The company adopted these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, the guidance requires a gross presentation of the activity within the Level 3 roll forward, separately presenting information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements. The roll forward information must be provided by the company for the first quarter of fiscal 2012, as the provision is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim reporting periods within those years. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that changed the consolidation model for variable interest entities. The provisions are effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. See also Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on new accounting standards. Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results This Report contains forward looking statements that reflect the companys current expectations regarding future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements of the company. The company tries, wherever possible, to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, will and similar expressions. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements reflect the companys current plans and expectations and are based on information currently available to it. They rely on a number of assumptions regarding future events and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The company wishes to caution the reader that the following important factors and those important factors described in Part 1, Item 1A and elsewhere in the commentary, or in the Securities and Exchange Commission 32 Table of Contents filings of the company, could affect the companys actual results and could cause such results to vary materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company: the impact of strong competitive response to the companys efforts to leverage its brand power with product innovation, promotional programs and new advertising, and of changes in consumer demand for the companys products; the risks in the marketplace associated with trade and consumer acceptance of product improvements, shelving initiatives, new product introductions, and pricing and promotional strategies; the companys ability to achieve sales and earnings guidance, which is based on assumptions about sales volume, product mix, the development and success of new products, the impact of marketing and pricing actions, product costs and currency; the companys ability to realize projected cost savings and benefits; the companys ability to successfully manage changes to its business processes, including selling, distribution, manufacturing, information management systems and the integration of acquisitions; the increased significance of certain of the companys key trade customers; the impact of inventory management practices by the companys trade customers; the impact of fluctuations in the supply and inflation in energy, raw and packaging materials cost; the impact associated with portfolio changes and completion of acquisitions and divestitures; the uncertainties of litigation described from time to time in the companys Securities and Exchange Commission filings; the impact of changes in currency exchange rates, tax rates, interest rates, debt and equity markets, inflation rates, economic conditions and other external factors; and the impact of unforeseen business disruptions in one or more of the companys markets due to political instability, civil disobedience, armed hostilities, natural disasters or other calamities. This discussion of uncertainties is by no means exhaustive but is designed to highlight important factors that may impact the companys outlook. The company disclaims any obligation or intent to update forward looking statements made by the company in order to reflect new information, events or circumstances after the date they are made.
