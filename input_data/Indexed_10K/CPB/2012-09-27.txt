Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOVERVIEW Description of the Company Campbell Soup Company is a manufacturer and marketer of high quality, branded convenience food products. The company reports the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and North America Foodservice. Key Strategies Campbells long term goal is to drive profitable net sales growth as a means to deliver attractive, sustainable total shareowner returns. To grow net sales, the company is focused on expanding its brand and product platforms in three core categories simple meals, healthy beverages and baked snacks. Its plans are designed to tap into segments and adjacencies with high growth profiles and strong prospects for growth within these categories. Three strategies guide this effort:Stabilize and then profitably grow the companys North America soup and simple meals business.Expand the companys international presence.Continue to drive growth in the companys healthy beverages and baked snacks businesses.By reducing less profitable promotional support and increasing consumer brand building in 2012, Campbell took steps towards stabilizing the profitability of its soup and simple meals business in North America. In 2013, the company is increasing its pipeline of consumer driven innovation by expanding its product platforms and packaging formats to reach new consumers and new usage occasions. To this end, the company will introduce more than 50 new products in 2013 ranging from new varieties of Chunky ready to eat soups and Campbells condensed soups to new products under the Campbells Go platform and new sauces under the Campbells Skillet Sauces brand. In addition to its innovation offerings, the company plans to increase its focus on other important growth drivers, such as product positioning, taste, availability, merchandising and price, to strengthen and grow its core soup and simple meals business portfolio in North America.Campbell plans to expand its presence in international markets by extending product platforms in its current businesses, pursuing growth opportunities in faster growing emerging markets, and expanding its export businesses in both existing and new geographies. The companys strategy for emerging market growth is likely to be centered on external development, ranging from acquisitions to strategic alliances such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships. Investments in its business in the Peoples Republic of China, where the company has a majority stake in a joint venture with Swire Pacific Limited, are expected to continue in 2013.In Campbells healthy beverages business, the company will continue the U.S. expansion of its V8 V Fusion beverages into faster growing segments and channels, such as sparkling and energy beverages, teas and juice boxes. It will invest to revitalize the V8 100% vegetable juice franchise in the U.S. by reengaging both current and lapsed users with a new advertising campaign and new varieties. In the international beverage business, the company expects to attract new users in its Asia Pacific business through product improvements, such as the conversion from glass to PET packaging, and to further accelerate beverage growth in its Latin American business. 14In Campbells baked snacks portfolio, the company is increasing its focus on innovation while further enhancing collaboration between its Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts divisions to leverage new product ideas between these powerful brands. Pepperidge Farm will continue to drive growth in its very successful Goldfish brand, along with its savory cracker, cookie and bakery products. At Arnotts in Australia, the focus remains on innovation in sweet and savory biscuits, along with further development of products designed to address the light lunch eating occasion.The Bolthouse Farms acquisition provides the company with a new growth platform within its portfolio. As previously discussed, Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value added natural, healthy products. Bolthouse Farms U.S. and Canadian market leading super premium refrigerated beverages complement the companys successful V8 beverage business, and Bolthouse Farms leading U.S. and Canadian market position in fresh carrots anchors its business and provides significant cash flow. In addition, Bolthouse Farms prominent position in the high growth packaged fresh category augments the companys existing chilled soup business in North America, and offers opportunities for expansion into adjacent packaged fresh segments that respond directly to significant consumer trends. Executive Summary This Executive Summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. Net sales were $7.707 billion in 2012, comparable to a year ago. Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 38.8% from 40.2% a year ago.Net earnings per share were $2.41 in 2012, compared to $2.42 in 2011. The current year included $.03 per share of expense from items that impacted comparability. The prior year included $.12 per share of expense from items that impacted comparability, as discussed below. Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company 2012 Compared with 2011The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and earnings per share:In 2011, the company announced a series of initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and reduce overhead costs across the organization to help fund plans to drive the growth of the business. The company also announced its intent to exit the Russian market. In 2012, the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $10 million ($6 million after tax or $.02 per share) related to the initiatives. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $63 million ($41 million after tax or $.12 per share) related to the initiatives. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges" for additional information; and In 2012, the company recorded pre tax transaction costs of $5 million ($3 million after tax or $.01 per share) related to the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms.The items impacting comparability are summarized below: 2012 2011 EarningsImpact EPSImpact EarningsImpact EPSImpact (Millions, except per share amounts)Net earnings$774 $2.41 $805 $2.42 Restructuring charges$(6) $(.02) $(41) $(.12)Acquisition transaction costs(3) (.01) Impact of items on net earnings$(9) $(.03) $(41) $(.12)Net earnings were $774 million ($2.41 per share) in 2012, compared to $805 million ($2.42 per share) in 2011. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, net earnings decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin percentage partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, which was primarily due to share repurchases under the companys strategic share repurchase programs. Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests The company owns a 60% controlling interest in a joint venture formed with Swire Pacific Limited to support the development of the companys business in China. The joint venture began operations on January 31, 2011, the beginning of the third quarter of 2011. The noncontrolling interests share in the net loss was included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The company also owns a 70% controlling interest in a Malaysian food products manufacturing company. Historically, the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were less than $1 million annually and, prior to the third quarter of 2011, were 15included in Other expenses/(income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest were included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The earnings were not material in 2012 and in 2011. Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company 2011 Compared with 2010In addition to the 2011 item that impacted comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share previously disclosed, the following items also impacted comparability:In the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded a restructuring charge of $12 million ($8 million after tax or $.02 per share) for pension benefit costs related to the 2008 initiatives to improve operational efficiency and long term profitability. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Restructuring Charges for additional information; andIn the third quarter of 2010, the company recorded deferred tax expense of $10 million, or $.03 per share, to reduce deferred tax assets as a result of the U.S. health care legislation enacted in March 2010. The law changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees.The items impacting comparability are summarized below: 2011 2010 EarningsImpact EPSImpact EarningsImpact EPSImpact (Millions, except per share amounts)Net earnings$805 $2.42 $844 $2.42 Restructuring charges$(41) $(.12) $(8) $(.02)Deferred tax expense from U.S. health care legislation (10) (.03)Impact of items on net earnings$(41) $(.12) $(18) $(.05)Net earnings were $805 million ($2.42 per share) in 2011 and $844 million ($2.42 per share) in 2010. After adjusting for the items impacting comparability, net earnings decreased in 2011 primarily due to a decline in gross margin percentage and lower sales volume, partly offset by lower marketing expenses and the impact of currency. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings per share increased in 2011 due to a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases under the companys strategic share repurchase program.DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISSalesAn analysis of net sales by reportable segment follows: % Change 2012 2011 2010 2012/2011 2011/2010 (Millions) U.S. Simple Meals$2,726 $2,751 $2,938 (1) (6)Global Baking and Snacking2,193 2,156 1,975 2 9International Simple Meals and Beverages1,404 1,463 1,423 (4) 3U.S. Beverages774 759 762 2 North America Foodservice610 590 578 3 2 $7,707 $7,719 $7,676 116An analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows: 2012 versus 2011U.S.SimpleMeals GlobalBakingandSnacking InternationalSimple MealsandBeverages U.S.Beverages NorthAmericaFoodservice TotalVolume and Mix(4)% (1)% (3)% 3% 2% (2)%Price and Sales Allowances3 5 2 2 3Increased Promotional Spending (1) (3) (1) (1) (1) (1)Currency 1 (2) (1)% 2% (4)% 2% 3% %2011 versus 2010U.S.SimpleMeals GlobalBakingandSnacking InternationalSimple MealsandBeverages U.S.Beverages NorthAmericaFoodservice TotalVolume and Mix(5)% 3% % 2% (1)% (1)%Price and Sales Allowances 2 1(Increased)/Decreased Promotional Spending (1)(1) (1) (1) (2) 2 (1)Currency 5 4 1 2 (6)% 9% 3% % 2% 1% (1)Represents revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs.In 2012, U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 1%. U.S. Soup declined 2% as lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices, reflecting a continued cautious consumer environment. Further details of U.S. Soup include:Sales of Campbells condensed soups increased 1% due to gains in eating varieties as cooking varieties were comparable to a year ago.Sales of ready to serve soups decreased 7%. Ready to serve soup volumes were impacted by the companys shift to improve price realization through higher selling prices and reduced promotional spending. The introduction of Campbells Slow Kettle soups in July 2011 positively impacted sales performance.Broth sales increased 3% primarily due to volume gains and the introduction of Swanson Flavor Boost concentrated broth, which launched in July 2011.U.S. Sauces sales increased slightly as gains in Prego pasta sauces were mostly offset by declines in sales of Pace Mexican sauces and other simple meal products. Sales of Pace Mexican sauces were negatively impacted by increased private label competitive activity. In U.S. Sauces, promotional spending was increased to improve marketplace performance.In 2011, U.S. Simple Meals sales decreased 6%. U.S. soup sales decreased 6% reflecting an overall weak economy; a challenging competitive environment in the U.S. food industry; changes in buying patterns among U.S. shoppers, particularly in stock up purchase behavior; and lower levels of product innovation.

Sales at Arnotts declined reflecting an increase in promotional spending as the business was impacted by a difficult customer and consumer environment. In 2011, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 9% as both Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts achieved volume gains and also benefited from higher selling prices. Pepperidge Farm sales increased primarily due to growth in Goldfish snack crackers and 17bakery products, including whole grain bread. In Arnotts, sales increased primarily due to currency, as well as gains in Shapes, Cruskits, and Vita Weat savory crackers, and chocolate biscuits.In 2012, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 4%.

For the segment, higher selling prices, productivity improvements and lower promotional spending were mostly offset by lower volumes and cost inflation. Earnings from U.S. Simple Meals decreased 11% in 2011 versus 2010. The decline was primarily due to lower sales and a reduced gross margin percentage, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. In the first half of 2011, in response to the overall competitive environment, the company maintained higher levels of promotional support, which did not deliver anticipated volume gains.19Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking decreased 11% in 2012 versus 2011 primarily due to cost inflation, increased promotional spending and higher advertising expense, partly offset by higher selling prices and productivity improvements. Promotional spending was increased to support the businesses.Earnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased 10% in 2011 versus 2010. The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and volume driven growth in both Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts.Earnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 17% in 2012 versus 2011.

This investment will occur through the second quarter of 2013 and will result in the elimination of approximately 190 positions. Further, the company improved asset utilization in the U.S. by shifting production of ready to serve soups from Paris, Texas, to other facilities in 2012. In addition, the manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, was closed in 2011, and manufacturing of Campbells Soup at Hand microwavable products was consolidated at the Maxton, North Carolina, plant in 2012.The company streamlined its salaried workforce by approximately 510 positions around the world, including approximately 130 positions at its world headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

For additional information relating to the initiatives, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESThe company expects that foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements, including cash outflows to repay debt, pay dividends and fund pension plan contributions, will be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long term borrowings under its shelf registration statement; short term borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash equivalents. Over the last three years, operating cash flows totaled approximately $3.3 billion. This cash generating capability provides the company with substantial financial flexibility in meeting its operating and investing needs.

In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans. Excluding shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding requirements on the vesting of restricted shares and for stock option exercises, the company repurchased 14 million shares at a cost of $472 million during 2010. Approximately $250 million was used to repurchase shares pursuant to the companys June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program. In addition to the June 2008 publicly announced share repurchase program, the company also purchased shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under the companys stock compensation plans.At July 29, 2012, the company had $786 million of short term borrowings due within one year and $47 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. At that date, the company had a $500 million credit facility that matured in September 2012, and a $1.5 billion facility that matures in September 2016. These facilities remained unused at July 29, 2012, except for $3 million of standby letters of credit issued on behalf of the company. In September 2012, the company entered into a $500 million committed revolving credit facility that matures in September 2016, replacing the $500 million credit facility that matured in September 2012. These revolving credit agreements support the companys commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes.As previously disclosed, on August 6, 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms for $1.55 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was funded through a combination of short and long term borrowings. Approximately $300 million was funded through the issuance of commercial paper. The terms of long term borrowings, which were issued on August 2, 2012 to fund the transaction, were as follows:$400 million floating rate notes that mature on August 1, 2014. Interest on the notes is based on 3 month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 0.30%. Interest is payable quarterly beginning November 1, 2012;$450 million of 2.50% notes that mature on August 2, 2022. Interest is payable semi annually beginning February 2, 2013. The company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption; and 22$400 million of 3.80% notes that mature on August 2, 2042. Interest is payable semi annually beginning February 2, 2013. The company may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption.In November 2011, the company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. This registration statement replaced the 2008 registration statement, which expired in November 2011. Under the registration statement, the company may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions.The company is in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facilities and debt securities.CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTSContractual Obligations The following table summarizes the companys obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of July 29, 2012. For additional information on debt, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long term liabilities, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest payments on long term debt are based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at fiscal year end.(3)Represents payments of cross currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, commodity contracts, and deferred compensation hedges. Contractual payments for cross currency swaps represent future undiscounted cash payments based on forward interest and foreign exchange rates.(4)Represents other long term liabilities, excluding unrecognized tax benefits, postretirement benefits and payments related to pension plans. For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments The company guarantees approximately 2,000 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments the company could be required to make under the guarantees is $164 million. The companys guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. The company does not believe that it is probable that it will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off balance sheet arrangements. INFLATIONSince 2010, the company has experienced inflationary increases primarily in commodity costs. The company continues to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations. 23MARKET RISK SENSITIVITYThe principal market risks to which the company is exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, the company is exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. The company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable rate and fixed rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain its variable to total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for approximately 30% of 2012 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Belgium. The company manages its foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross currency swaps and forward contracts. Cross currency swaps and forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The company does not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The company principally uses a combination of purchase orders and various short and long term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. The company also enters into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, soybean oil, aluminum, wheat, natural gas and cocoa, which impact the cost of raw materials. The information below summarizes the companys market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of July 29, 2012. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 11 through 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable rate debt maturing in 2012 represent the weighted average rates at the period end. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the weighted average forward rates for the term of each contract.

As of July 31, 2011, the company had swapped $500 million of fixed rate debt to variable. The average rate to be received on these swaps was 4.95%, and the average rate paid was estimated to be 0.97% over the remaining life of the swaps. The company is exposed to foreign exchange risk related to its international operations, including non functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. The following table summarizes the cross currency swaps outstanding as of July 29, 2012, which hedge such exposures. The notional amount of each currency and the related weighted average forward interest rate are presented in the Cross Currency Swaps table. 24Cross Currency Swaps Fiscal Year of Expiration Interest Rate Notional Value Fair Value (Millions)Pay variable AUD 2013 3.51% $7 $Receive variable USD 0.44% Pay variable AUD 2013 3.58% $52 $Receive variable USD 0.53% Pay variable AUD 2013 4.08% $133 $(25)Receive variable USD 1.08% Pay variable CAD 2013 1.41% $45 $1Receive variable USD 0.41% Pay variable CAD 2013 1.16% $40 $2Receive variable USD 0.47% Pay variable EUR 2013 1.28% $21 $2Receive variable USD 1.34% Pay variable EUR 2013 (0.01)% $90 $5Receive variable USD 0.42% Pay variable EUR 2013 0.17% $61 $4Receive variable USD 0.48% Pay variable EUR 2013 0.18% $69 $5Receive variable USD 0.48% Pay fixed CAD 2014 6.24% $60 $(25)Receive fixed USD 5.66% Pay variable CAD 2014 1.59% $83 $(2)Receive variable USD 0.59% Pay variable AUD 2015 4.54% $133 $(26)Receive variable USD 1.24% Pay variable CAD 2015 1.79% $42 $(1)Receive variable USD 0.74% Total $836 $(60)The cross currency swap contracts outstanding at July 31, 2011, represented four pay variable EUR/receive variable USD swaps with notional values totaling $192 million, one pay fixed EUR/receive fixed USD swap with a notional value of $102 million, two pay variable CAD/receive variable USD swaps with notional values totaling $119 million, two pay variable AUD/receive variable USD swaps with notional values totaling $266 million, and two pay fixed CAD/receive fixed USD swaps with notional values totaling $218 million. The aggregate notional value of these swap contracts was $897 million as of July 31, 2011, and the aggregate fair value of these swap contracts was a loss of $128 million as of July 31, 2011. The company is also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. The company utilizes foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted average contract exchange rates as of July 29, 2012. 25Forward Exchange Contracts Contract Amount Average Contractual Exchange Rate (currency paid/ currency received)Receive USD/Pay CAD$139 1.01Receive USD/Pay AUD$30 0.98Receive AUD/Pay NZD$25 1.26Receive AUD/Pay USD$13 0.99Receive EUR/Pay SEK$10 8.39The company had an additional $11 million in a number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies, such as the Australian dollar, British Pound, and euro, as of July 29, 2012. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a gain of $2 million as of July 29, 2012. The total forward exchange contracts outstanding were $251 million, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $9 million as of July 31, 2011. The company enters into commodity futures and options contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. The notional value of these contracts was $95 million and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4 million as of July 29, 2012. The notional value of these contracts was $87 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $1 million as of July 31, 2011. The company enters into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of the companys capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index and, beginning in April 2012, the total return of the Vanguard Short Term Bond Index. Under these contracts, the company pays variable interest rates and receives from the counterparty either the total return on company capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poors 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index; or the total return of the Vanguard Short Term Bond Index. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on company capital stock was $26 million at July 29, 2012 and $51 million at July 31, 2011. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2013, was 0.76% at July 29, 2012. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poors 500 Index was $15 million at July 29, 2012 and $16 million at July 31, 2011. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2013, was 0.64% at July 29, 2012. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $4 million at July 29, 2012 and July 31, 2011. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2013, was 0.71% at July 29, 2012. The notional value of the contract that was linked to the return on the Vanguard Short Term Bond Index was $30 million at July 29, 2012. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in 2013, was 0.71% at July 29, 2012. The fair value of these contracts was a $1 million gain at July 29, 2012 and a $3 million loss at July 31, 2011. The companys utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and the companys acquisition and divestiture activities. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThe consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: Trade and consumer promotion programs The company offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on the companys overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly 26or annual financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. Valuation of long lived assets Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The company may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. As of July 29, 2012, the carrying value of goodwill was $2.013 billion. The company has not recognized any impairment of goodwill as a result of annual testing, which began in 2003. As of the 2012 measurement, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by at least 45%. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2012 measurement constant, a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value. Indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value. As of July 29, 2012, the carrying value of trademarks was $485 million. In 2012, as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized related to the Bl Band trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year. As of July 29, 2012, certain European trademarks have a carrying value of approximately $40 million, which approximates fair value. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2012 measurement constant, a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of all trademarks and result in an impairment charge of approximately $6 million. In 2011, as part of the companys annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $3 million was recognized related to the Heisse Tasse trademark used in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. The trademark was determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brand, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year. The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond the companys control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ from managements estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. See also Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets. Pension and postretirement benefits The company provides certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. The discount rate is established as of the companys fiscal year end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, the company reviews published market indices of high quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering the companys current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is 27amortized into earnings in the following year. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense was $102 million in 2012, $98 million in 2011, and $92 million in 2010. The 2010 expense included $12 million of pension settlement costs related to the closure of a plant in Canada. Significant weighted average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows: 201220112010Pension Discount rate for benefit obligations4.05%5.41%5.46%Expected return on plan assets7.65%7.90%8.15%Postretirement Discount rate for obligations3.75%5.00%5.25%Initial health care trend rate8.25%8.25%8.25%Ultimate health care trend rate4.50%4.50%4.50%Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $18 million; a 50 basis point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $12 million. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million. Net periodic pension and postretirement expense is expected to increase to approximately $128 million in 2013 primarily due to increased amortization of unrecognized losses. The company contributed $55 million and $100 million, respectively, to U.S. pension plans in 2012 and 2011. Given the adverse impact of declining financial markets on the funding levels of the plans, the company contributed $260 million to a U.S. plan in 2010. Contributions to non U.S. plans were $16 million in 2012, $44 million in 2011, and $24 million in 2010. The company contributed $75 million to U.S. plans in the first quarter of 2013. Additional contributions to U.S. plans are not expected in 2013. Contributions to non U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $13 million in 2013. See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses. Income taxes The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates and managements estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See also Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.
