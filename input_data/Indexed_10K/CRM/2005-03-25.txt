ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding revenues, expenses and results of operations. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors Which May Impact Future Operating Results. We assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors. Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to a March 2004 report by Forrester Research, Inc. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions. We define paying subscriptions as unique user accounts, purchased by customers for use by their employees and other customer authorized users that have not been suspended for non payment and for which we are recognizing subscription revenue. The number of our paying subscribers increased from approximately 30,000 as of February 1, 2001 to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. We plan to re invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by hiring additional personnel, particularly in marketing and sales; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; obtaining additional business continuity services, additional data center capacity and a separate development and test data center; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 55 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2005 and 57 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2005, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2005. 20 Table of Contents Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for 90 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2005 and 89 percent during fiscal 2004. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges, employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing consulting services. To the extent that our customer base grows, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. Additionally, we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services and additional data center capacity. We currently expect these resources to be in place at various dates during fiscal 2006. We currently expect the annual cost of these services to be approximately $7.0 million. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses and allocated overhead. We have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to 21 Table of Contents have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We are also in the process of obtaining a development and test data center, which we currently expect will be in place by July 2005. We expect the annual cost of this data center to be approximately $4.0 million. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. As our revenues increase, we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive, finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non employees, option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services. These charges have been significant and are reflected in the historical financial results. Excluding the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options, we expect stock based expenses to be between $3.0 to $4.0 million in fiscal 2006. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2005, we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors interest in the ventures results. Through January 31, 2005, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 22 Table of Contents We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. On August 1, 2003, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is probable; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, consulting revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct and incremental costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $874,000 at January 31, 2005 and $32,000 at January 31, 2004. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2005, we deferred $14.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $15.6 million to sales expense. During fiscal 2004, we deferred $16.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $8.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled and $9.6 million at January 31, 2005 and $11.2 million at January 31, 2004. 23 Table of Contents We assess the commission plans for our sales representatives annually. The impact of any changes to the commission plans will have an effect on the growth of the deferred commission asset balance. During fiscal 2005, we paid our sales representatives upfront commissions for the first two years of the noncancelable subscription contracts. In previous years, we paid upfront commissions on the entire value of the noncancelable subscription contracts, which had terms ranging up to 5 years. Accounting for Stock Based Awards. We recorded deferred stock based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, our operating and financial performance, private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties, issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm. Following our initial public offering, the fair value of our common stock is determined by the trading price of such stock on the New York Stock Exchange. We amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the four year vesting period of the underlying option awards. As of January 31, 2005, we had an aggregate of $5.9 million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized. We currently expect this deferred stock based compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $3.0 million during fiscal 2006; $2.0 million during fiscal 2007; $0.8 million during fiscal 2008 and $100,000 during fiscal 2009. We have elected not to record stock based compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Beginning on August 1, 2005, which is the start of our third quarter in fiscal 2006, we will begin to prospectively recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R (see Recent Accounting Pronouncement below for further discussion). We are currently assessing the impact this prospective change in accounting will have, but believe that it will have a material and adverse impact on our reported results of operations. In the past, we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non employees. For these options and warrants, we recognize stock based compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of January 31, 2005, we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to non employees except for options for 50,000 shares of our common stock, which will fully vest by July 2007 and have an exercise price of $2.50 per share. At January 31, 2005, one of the assumptions in the Black Scholes computation is an expected stock price volatility of 75 percent. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Historically, we have recorded a full valuation allowance to fully reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of being able to realize these benefits. If our positive trend of earnings continues, it is likely that the valuation allowance will be reversed at some point in the future. However, we cannot predict which quarter this will occur. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

The total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004. Our gross profit during fiscal 2005 was $142.9 million, or 81 percent of revenues, and operating income was $6.5 million. Operating income for the period included a non cash stock based expense of $3.6 million. During fiscal 2004, we generated a gross profit of $78.8 million, or 82 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $3.7 million, substantially all of which resulted from the reduction in accruals related to the release of future obligations associated with a portion of the office space that we abandoned in December 2001. Operating income during fiscal 2004 also included $4.4 million of non cash stock based expense. During fiscal 2005, we continued to incur substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business. We added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, and developers to broaden and enhance our on demand service. In June 2004, we completed our initial public offering and sold 11,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $11.00 per share through which we raised a total of $126.5 million in gross proceeds. After deducting the underwriting discount of $8.8 million and offering expenses of $3.9 million, net proceeds were $113.8 million. During fiscal 2005, we generated $55.9 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $21.8 million during fiscal 2004. At January 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $205.9 million, as compared to $35.8 million at January 31, 2004, accounts receivable of $48.9 million, as compared to $26.5 million at January 31, 2004, and deferred revenue of $95.9 million, as compared to $49.7 million at January 31, 2004. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues. Total revenues were $176.4 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $96.0 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of $80.4 million, or 84 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying 27 Table of Contents subscribers to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004. Professional services and other revenues were $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $18.4 million, or 108 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $16.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily comprised of an increase of $12.1 million in employee related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 80 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 million in service delivery costs and an increase of $1.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2005 by $2.3 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded. The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. In any particular quarterly period during fiscal 2006, our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may slightly exceed 20 percent. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $2.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of $2.3 million and an increase of $0.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since January 31, 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $41.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $34.3 million in employee related costs, $3.5 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings and event costs and $3.4 million in allocated overhead. Of the $34.3 million increase in employee related costs, $7.0 million was related to the increased amortization expense of deferred commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 76 percent since January 31, 2004 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.4 million. The increase was due to an increase of $8.3 million in employee related costs and $5.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 64 percent since January 31, 2004 as we added personnel to support our growth. The increase in professional and outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the United States. 28 Table of Contents Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $3.4 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlords lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our landlord that would release us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in our headquarters building in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building. The agreement is contingent upon the occurrence of certain conditions that will affect the final determination of the lease abandonment accrual on our consolidated balance sheet. If these certain conditions occur, we believe there will be an immaterial reduction in the accrual, which will be reflected as lease recovery during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Because of the March 2005 agreement described above, we are currently evaluating the possibility of consolidating more of our operations in the headquarters building. If we did this, we would abandon approximately 20,000 square feet of office space located elsewhere in San Francisco, which is under a long term operating lease commitment. Such an abandonment would result in a charge against our operating results in the quarter in which the event would occur. Operating Income. Operating income during fiscal 2005 was $6.5 million. During fiscal 2004, it was $3.7 million, substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above. The increase in operating income year over year was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Income (losses) from operations outside of the Americas was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and $(1.1) million during fiscal 2004. The continued investment outside of the Americas was due to our efforts in expanding the number of locations where we conduct business and expanding our international selling and marketing activities. Interest Income. Interest income substantially consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and also includes interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and was $379,000 during fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income tax expense of $1.2 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to a provision for income tax expense of $541,000 for fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes consists of amounts accrued for our domestic federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax liability as well as our foreign income tax expense. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 and 2004 was 13 percent. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to domestic loss carryovers net of foreign losses with no benefit. As of January 31, 2005, our deferred tax asset balance was $28.2 million and was fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. To realize the deferred tax assets, pretax income must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized. Historic profits have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date. Further, ongoing stock option exercise activity may, as in fiscal 2005, increase the total deferred tax asset balance. Accordingly, management cannot determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets and therefore we have fully offset net deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance. Based on our estimates for fiscal 2006 and beyond, we believe the uncertainty regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets may diminish to the point where deferred tax assets may be realized. If we were to 29 Table of Contents determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase our income or reduce our loss and increase stockholders equity in the quarter when such determination is made. The change in the valuation allowance of $8.5 million is primarily due to the uncertainties of realizing certain domestic losses, net operating losses incurred by the Japanese joint venture and certain tax credit carryforwards. The balance in the valuation allowance at the end of fiscal 2005 includes approximately $8.1 million for stock plan deductions, which will be credited to additional capital and the provision for income taxes if realized. We currently believe that our fiscal 2006 effective tax rate will be approximately 25 percent, exclusive of the impact of expensing stock options beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of full year income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. The estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items. These actual results could vary from those projected. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2004 and 2003 Revenues. Total revenues were $96.0 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $51.0 million during fiscal 2003, an increase of $45.0 million, or 88 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004, compared to $47.7 million, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2003. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004 from approximately 76,000 as of January 31, 2003. Professional services and other revenues were $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004, compared to $3.3 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2003. The increase in professional service and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increasing number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $7.1 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $10.0 million, or 141 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and the expansion of our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $10.4 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $6.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.4 million in employee related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 53 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization, and an increase of $700,000 in service delivery costs. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the higher demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded. The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve new customers and paying subscribers. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $4.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $2.4 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.8 million in employee related costs. Our research and development headcount increased by 57 percent from fiscal 2003 as we added personnel to upgrade and extend our service offerings. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $33.5 million, or 66 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $21.1 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $18.0 million in employee related costs, $1.0 million in increased marketing event costs, $800,000 in payments to partners, and $700,000 in allocated 30 Table of Contents overhead. Of the $18.0 million in increased employee related costs, $6.6 million was related to sales commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 42 percent from fiscal 2003 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, compared to $13.0 million, or 26 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2003, an increase of $3.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.0 million in employee related costs and an increase of $900,000 in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 29 percent from fiscal 2003 as we added personnel to support our growth. Lease Recovery. In December 2001, we abandoned excess office space in San Francisco, California and recorded a $7.7 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 pertaining to the estimated future net obligations under the non cancelable lease. Since the space was not leased to a subtenant, there were no immediate cash savings from the abandonment. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlords lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $4.3 million credit to reflect the reversal of the remaining accrued liability that was directly associated with this space. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded an additional accrual of $900,000 related to the remaining 5,000 square feet of abandoned office space in San Francisco. This additional accrual resulted from a revision of our estimates of the timing and amount of projected subtenant income based on difficulties in subleasing the remaining space. Operating Income (Loss). Operating income during fiscal 2004 was $3.7 million and included the $3.4 million lease recovery described above. The operating loss during fiscal 2003 was $10.5 million. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a $45.0 million increase in revenues, most of which was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Loss from operations outside of the Americas was $1.1 million during fiscal 2004 and was $3.8 million during fiscal 2003. The continued losses outside of the Americas were due to our efforts in expanding the number of locations where we conduct business and expanding our international selling and marketing activities. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. Interest income was $379,000 during fiscal 2004, compared to $471,000 during fiscal 2003, a decrease of $92,000. The decrease was primarily due to declining interest rates and the mix of marketable securities investments, substantially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes of $541,000 during fiscal 2004 represented federal alternative minimum taxes of approximately $200,000, and various state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes of approximately $300,000. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 13 percent as compared to zero for fiscal 2003. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to domestic loss carryovers net of foreign losses with no benefit. Our deferred tax asset balance at January 31, 2004 was $19.7 million and was fully offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount due to uncertainties regarding realization of the deferred tax asset balance. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2005, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million, accounts receivable of $48.9 million and cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal 2005 of $55.9 million. In June 2004, we completed the sale of 11,500,000 shares of common stock in an initial public offering, including the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option, and realized net proceeds of $113.8 million. To date, we have not spent any of the proceeds from the initial public offering. 31 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $55.9 million during fiscal 2005, $21.8 million during fiscal 2004 and $5.2 million during fiscal 2003. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by or used in operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $149.2 million during fiscal 2005, $21.1 million during fiscal 2004 and $9.6 million during fiscal 2003. The increase in amounts used in fiscal 2005 primarily related to the investment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock in our initial public offering, the investment of excess cash, the reduction in restricted cash balances and capital expenditures associated with computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of expanding our infrastructure and work force. Net cash provided by financing activities was $118.9 million during fiscal 2005, $1.1 million during fiscal 2004 and $1.0 million during fiscal 2003. The $118.5 million of net proceeds from both the sale of common stock during the initial public offering and the exercise of employee stock options and the collection of $1.0 million in notes receivable from stockholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations and the repurchase of unvested shares of common stock from terminated employees. At January 31, 2005, our employees held 4.7 million vested stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $1.88 per share. If our employees exercise these awards, we will receive a significant amount of proceeds from the option exercises. During fiscal 2001, we established a $3.5 million letter of credit in favor of our principal office landlord. This amount was reduced in June 2004 to $2.8 million. This letter of credit is collateralized by a certificate of deposit, which is maintained at the granting financial institution, for the same amount. This certificate of deposit is included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. As of January 31, 2005, the letter of credit was outstanding and, to date, no amounts have been drawn against it. The letter of credit renews annually through December 31, 2010. In addition, we had two additional letters of credit outstanding as of January 31, 2005, which are related to office space leases. These letters of credit are collateralized by certificates of deposit totaling $0.4 million at the granting financial institution, for the same amount and are included as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. These letters of credit are due at various dates through December 2008. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2005, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 1,317 $ 585 $ 732 $ $ Operating lease obligations: Office space 38,691 8,367 13,232 10,731 6,361 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 6,442 3,642 2,800 Contractual commitments 2,390 1,572 818 Lease abandonment liabilities and other 1,874 278 466 486 644 32 Table of Contents Our office lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. In February 2005, we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of $8.8 million. Additionally, we are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services, additional data center capacity and a development and test data center. We expect these resources to be in place at various dates during fiscal 2006. While the costs for these will be significant, we believe that most of the capital expenditures for the additional business continuity services, additional data center capacity and development and test data center will be leased so there will not be a significant impact on our liquidity during fiscal 2006. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. Although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We plan to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R on August 1, 2005, which is the start of our third fiscal quarter next year. We are currently assessing the impact this prospective change in accounting will have but believe that it will have a material and adverse impact on our reported results of operations. Additionally, SFAS 123R requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. We currently classify these tax benefits, which totaled $798,000 in fiscal 2005, as a source of cash provided by operating activities. 33 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS WHICH MAY IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We are an early stage company in an emerging market with an unproven business model, a new and unproven enterprise technology model and a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. We have only a limited operating history and our current business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on demand CRM application service in February 2000. The risks and difficulties we encounter as an early stage company in the new and rapidly evolving market of on demand CRM application services include the following: our new and unproven business and technology models; a limited number of service offerings and risks associated with developing new service offerings; and the difficulties we face in managing rapid growth in personnel and operations. We may not be able to successfully address any of these risks or others, including the other risks related to our business and industry described below. Failure to adequately do so could seriously harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. Defects in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject us to substantial liability. Because our service is complex and we have incorporated a variety of software both developed in house and acquired from third party vendors, our service may have errors or defects that users identify after they begin using it that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our existing service may be detected in the future. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects or other performance problems with our service could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, or delay or withhold payment to us, we could lose future sales or customers may make warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. Interruptions or delays in service from our third party Web hosting facility could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business. We provide our service through computer hardware that is currently located in a third party Web hosting facility in Sunnyvale, California operated by Qwest Communications International Inc. We do not control the operation of this facility, and it is subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. It is also subject to break ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at the facility, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at the facility could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, the failure by the Qwest facility to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. We have an agreement with SunGard Data Systems, a provider of availability services, to provide access to a geographically remote disaster recovery facility that would provide us access to hardware, software and Internet connectivity in the event the Qwest facility becomes unavailable. Even with this disaster recovery arrangement, however, our service would be interrupted during the transition. We are currently in the process of obtaining additional business continuity services and additional data center capacity, however, none of the services or capacity is currently operational. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service 34 Table of Contents may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates. Our business will be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our service is unreliable. If we experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and rate of growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue and earnings expectations, our results would be harmed and our stock price may fall rapidly and without advance notice. Due to our limited operating history, our evolving business model and the unpredictability of our emerging industry, we may not be able to accurately forecast our rate of growth. For example, in the last ten fiscal quarters, we have recorded quarterly operating income of as much as $4.3 million and quarterly operating losses of as much as $4.9 million. We base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans on estimates of future revenue and future rate of growth. Our expenses and investments are, to a large extent, fixed and we expect that these expenses will increase in the future. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue falls short of our expectations. As a result, we expect that our operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. Revenue growth may not be sustainable and may decrease in the future. We believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results can fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially. Our quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements; the renewal rates for our service; changes in our pricing policies; the introduction of new features to our service; the rate of expansion and effectiveness of our sales force; the length of the sales cycle for our service; new product and service introductions by our competitors; our success in selling our service to large enterprises; variations in the revenue mix of editions of our service; technical difficulties or interruptions in our service; general economic conditions in our geographic markets; the timing of additional investments in our on demand application service and in our consulting service; regulatory compliance costs; payment defaults by customers; and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute related settlement payments. Some of these factors are not within our control and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. 35 Table of Contents We have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future. We incurred significant losses in each fiscal quarter from our inception in February 1999 through fiscal 2003 and we generated small profits in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. As we are a young company in an emerging market, we may not be able to maintain profitability and we may incur additional significant operating losses in the future. In addition, we expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we expand our operations. If our revenue does not grow to offset these expected increased expenses, we will not continue to be profitable. You should not consider recent quarterly revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters we may not have any revenue growth and our revenue could decline. Furthermore, if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customers data, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant liabilities. Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our customers data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. Because we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months, although terms can range from one to 60 months. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter will not necessarily be fully reflected in the revenue in that quarter and will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. If our on demand application service is not widely accepted, our operating results will be harmed. We derive substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to our on demand application service, and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future. As a result, widespread acceptance of our service is critical to our future success. Factors that may affect market acceptance of our service include: reluctance by enterprises to migrate to an on demand application service; the price and performance of our service; the level of customization we can offer; the availability, performance and price of competing products and services; reluctance by enterprises to trust third parties to store and manage their internal data; and 36 Table of Contents adverse publicity about us, our service or the viability or security of on demand application services generally from third party reviews, industry analyst reports and adverse statements made by competitors. Many of these factors are beyond our control. The inability of our on demand application service to achieve widespread market acceptance would harm our business. The market for our technology delivery model and on demand application services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our business will be harmed. The market for on demand application services is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of on demand application services in general, and for CRM in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to on demand application services. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on demand application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on demand application services, then the market for these services may not develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results. In addition, as a new company in this unproven market, we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends, which could harm our business. We do not have an adequate history with our subscription model to predict the rate of customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and in fact, some customers have elected not to do so. In addition, our customers may renew for a lower priced edition of our service or for fewer subscriptions. We have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals, so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates. Our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their dissatisfaction with our service and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. If these efforts are not successful, our business may suffer. Our growth could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our growth, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. We are currently experiencing a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, to the extent that we are able to sustain such growth, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that further growth will be required to address increases in our customer base, as well as our expansion into new geographic areas. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage this growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and 37 Table of Contents management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. The additional headcount and capital investments we are adding will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by offsetting expense reductions in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our growth, we will be unable to execute our business plan. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from small businesses, which have a greater rate of attrition and non renewal than medium sized and large enterprise customers. Our small business customers, which we consider to be companies with fewer than 200 employees, typically have shorter initial subscription periods and, based on our limited experience to date, have had a higher rate of attrition and non renewal as compared to our medium sized and large enterprise customers. If we cannot replace our small business customers that do not renew their subscriptions for our service with new customers quickly enough, our revenue could decline. Our limited operating history may impede acceptance of our service by medium sized and large customers. Our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our service by medium sized and large businesses. Our efforts to sell to these customers may not continue to be successful. In particular, because we are a relatively new company with a limited operating history, these target customers may have concerns regarding our viability and may prefer to purchase critical CRM applications from one of our larger, more established competitors. Even if we are able to sell our service to these types of customers, they may insist on additional assurances from us that we will be able to provide adequate levels of service, which could harm our business. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and we may have to delay revenue recognition on these customers, all of which could harm our business. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, we will face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market segment, the customers decision to use our service may be an enterprise wide decision and, if so, these types of sales would require us to provide greater levels of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our service. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while at the same time requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical requirements have been met. In addition, larger enterprise customers may seek volume discounts and price concessions that could make these transactions less profitable. The market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. The market for CRM applications is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, barriers to entry are relatively low, many of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. If we fail to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed. Some of our principal competitors offer their products at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing, our operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our service to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business. 38 Table of Contents Our current principal competitors include: enterprise software application vendors including Amdocs Limited, E.piphany, Inc., IBM Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, PeopleSoft, Inc., which has been acquired by Oracle, SAP AG and Siebel Systems, Inc.; packaged CRM software vendors, some of whom offer hosted services, such as BMC Software Corporation, FrontRange Solutions, Inc., Onyx Software Corp., Pivotal Corporation, which has been acquired by CDC Software Corporation, a subsidiary of chinadotcom corporation, and Sage Group plc; on demand CRM application service providers such as Siebel Systems, NetSuite, Inc., RightNow Technologies, Inc., and Salesnet, Inc.; and enterprise application service providers including British Telecom, IBM and Corio, Inc., which has been acquired by IBM. In addition, we face competition from businesses that develop their own CRM applications internally, as well as from enterprise software vendors and online service providers who may develop and or bundle CRM products with their products in the future. We also face competition from some of our larger and more established competitors who historically have been packaged CRM software vendors, but who are developing directly competitive on demand CRM application services offerings, such as Siebel Systems through Siebel CRM OnDemand. Our professional services organization competes with a broad range of large systems integrators, including Accenture Ltd., BearingPoint, Inc. and IBM, as well as smaller independent consulting firms specializing in CRM implementations. We have relationships with many of these consulting companies and frequently work cooperatively on projects with them, even as we compete for business in other customer engagements. Many of our potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, many of our potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. Furthermore, because of these advantages, even if our service is more effective than the products that our competitors offer, potential customers might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our service. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. If we are not able to develop enhancements and new features to our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with technological developments, our business will be harmed. If we are unable to develop enhancements to and new features for our existing service or acceptable new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business will be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services such as Supportforce and Customforce depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the feature or edition. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with changes in Internet related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. 39 Table of Contents Any efforts we may make in the future to expand our service beyond the CRM market may not succeed. To date, we have focused our business on providing on demand application services for the CRM market, but we may in the future seek to expand into other markets. However, any efforts to expand beyond the CRM market may never result in significant revenue growth for us. In addition, efforts to expand our on demand application service beyond the CRM market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, which may harm our business. If we fail to develop our brand cost effectively, our business may suffer. We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the salesforce.com brand in a cost effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market develops. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expense. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand building efforts, and our business could suffer. Any failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth. We continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers, particularly large enterprise customers, and to manage our customer base. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take more than a year before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we would like, and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, sales of our service will suffer and our growth will be impeded. Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international sales. Because we sell our service throughout the world, we are subject to risks and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States. For example, sales in Europe and Asia Pacific together represented approximately 20 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2005, 18 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2004 and 14 percent of total revenues during fiscal 2003, and we intend to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States include: localization of our service, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; laws and business practices favoring local competitors; compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy and data protection laws and regulations; foreign currency fluctuations; different pricing environments; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property; 40 Table of Contents longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties; and regional economic and political conditions. Some of our international subscription fees are currently denominated in U.S. dollars and paid in local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may make the service more expensive for international customers, which could harm our business. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuation. Any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. We currently have no issued patents and may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third party claims or rights against their use. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to resolve, could divert management attention from executing our business plan and could require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our service to others. We rely on third party hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or which could cause errors or failures of our service. We rely on hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our service, including database software from Oracle Corporation. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, which could harm our business. Any errors or defects in third party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could harm our business. 41 Table of Contents We may be required to purchase the interest in our Japanese joint venture held by our joint venture partner, under certain circumstances, on terms that may not be favorable to us. In some circumstances, we may be required to purchase the interest of our Japanese joint venture partner. If we default under the terms of our joint venture agreement with our joint venture partner, or if we and our partner disagree over a course of action proposed for the joint venture entity and the disagreement continues, then our partner may require that we purchase its interest in the joint venture. In the event we are required to purchase our partners interest in the joint venture, we could be forced to make an unanticipated outlay of a significant amount of capital, which could harm our financial condition. Although the timing and circumstances of any such purchase, were it to be required, are not predictable, if the joint venture were valued based on its most recent financing, which occurred in September 2003, the buyout price could be as much as approximately $13.0 million. If we acquire any companies or technologies in the future, they could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results. We may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies in the future. We have not made any acquisitions or investments to date, and therefore our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel; diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations; risk of entering new markets; potential write offs of acquired assets or investments; potential loss of key employees; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs; and delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which could affect the market price of our stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed. Evolving regulation of the Internet may affect us adversely. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for CRM solutions and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet based services, which could harm our business. Privacy concerns and laws or other domestic or foreign regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our solution and adversely affect our business. Our customers can use our service to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding their customers and contacts. Federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies, however, have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed 42 Table of Contents by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. Furthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers customers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our service in certain industries. For example, regulations such as the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, which protects and restricts the use of consumer credit and financial information, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which regulates the use and disclosure of personal health information, impose significant requirements and obligations on businesses that may affect the use and adoption of our service. The European Union has also adopted a data privacy directive that requires member states to impose restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in some respects, are far more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on subject businesses, than current privacy standards in the United States. All of these domestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect our customers ability to collect and or use demographic and personal information from their customers, which could reduce demand for our service. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, CRM solutions would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our service and harm our business. The success of our business depends on the continued growth and acceptance of the Internet as a business tool. Expansion in the sales of our service depends on the continued acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commerce platform for enterprises. The Internet could lose its viability as a business tool due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been harmed by viruses, worms and similar malicious programs, and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If for any reason the Internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform, the demand for our service would be significantly reduced, which would harm our business. Our business is subject to changing regulations regarding corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance. We are subject to rules and regulations by various governing bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, New York Stock Exchange and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, that are charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. Our efforts to comply with these new regulations, most notably the Sarbanes Oxley Act, or SOX, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities. By the end of fiscal 2006, we are required to comply with the SOX requirements involving the assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment. Although we believe our on going review and testing of our internal controls will enable us to be compliant with the SOX requirements, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate by the end of fiscal 2006. If we cannot assess our internal controls over financial reporting as effective, or our external auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on such assessment, our stock price could decline. Moreover, because these laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance becomes available. This evolution may result in 43 Table of Contents continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices. If we fail to address and comply with these regulations and any subsequent changes, our business may be harmed. We are dependent on our management team and development and operations personnel, and the loss of one or more key employees or groups could harm our business and prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Marc Benioff, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Steve Cakebread, our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Steele, our President of Worldwide Sales and Services, Pat Sueltz, our President of Global Operations, and Parker Harris, our Executive Vice President of Technology. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our service and technologies. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees or groups could seriously harm our business. Because competition for our target employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth. To continue to execute on our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and Internet related services and senior sales executives. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the Internet and high technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock may, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees. Furthermore, the new requirement to expense stock options may discourage us from granting the size or type of stock options awards that job candidates require to join our company. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. We might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. 44 Table of Contents We believe our reported financial results will be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in December 2004, the FASB announced its decision to require companies to expense employee stock options. We plan to adopt this new accounting pronouncement, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. We believe this change in accounting will materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock If our involvement in a lengthy May 9, 2004 New York Times article about salesforce.com or any other publicity regarding salesforce.com or the initial public offering during the waiting period were held to be gun jumping in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, we could be required to repurchase securities sold in our initial public offering. In a New York Times article dated May 9, 2004 and entitled Its Not Google. Its That Other Big I.P.O., information regarding our initial public offering and salesforce.com, our development and our business strategy was published. In preparation of the article, the reporter spent most of a full day with Marc Benioff, our Chairman and CEO. As a result, it could have been expected that a lengthy article would be published. Portions of this New York Times article were subsequently reprinted by a number of news outlets. While some of the factual statements about salesforce.com in the article were disclosed in the Registration Statement for our initial public offering, the article presented statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in the Registration Statement. In addition to the New York Times article, there was substantial additional press coverage regarding us and the initial public offering during the offering process. These articles also presented statements about our company in isolation and did not disclose many of the related risks and uncertainties described in the Registration Statement. In order to reduce the risk of investors possible reliance on the New York Times article and other news reports and articles, we stopped our offering on May 13, 2004. We then allowed a cooling off period to pass so that the effect of this article and other reports, articles and information would be dissipated. It is uncertain whether the May 9th New York Times article or any of our publicity related activities could be held to be a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act. If any article or activity was held by a court to be in violation of the Securities Act, we could be required to repurchase the shares sold to purchasers in our public offering at the original $11.00 purchase price, plus interest, for a period of one year following the date of the violation. We would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the Securities Act occurred. The trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Further, our common stock has a limited trading history. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include: variations in our operating results; announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors; 45 Table of Contents recruitment or departure of key personnel; changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; and market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Any volatility in our stock price may result in litigation, such as the lawsuits following the approximate 25% decline in our stock price on July 21, 2004, which may harm our business and results of operations. If securities analysts stop publishing research or reports about us or our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. Furthermore, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. The concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5 percent or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, will have control over most matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial. Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time; establish the size of the board of directors at seven (7) members; provide that directors may only be removed for cause and only with the approval of 66 2/3 percent of our stockholders; require super majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws; authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that our board could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt; eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; 46 Table of Contents prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Japanese yen. We have a risk management policy that allows us to utilize foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows. If we were to enter into hedging contracts, the contracts by policy would have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy we would not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million at January 31, 2005. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase in interest rates of 100 basis points could result in higher interest income of $0.8 million offset by a principal reduction of $1.6 million for a net reduction of $0.8 million over a 12 month period. Similarly, a 100 basis point decrease could result in a decrease in interest income of $0.8 million and a principal increase of $1.6 million for a net increase of $0.8 million. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. 47 Table of Contents
