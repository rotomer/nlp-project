ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors Which May Impact Future Operating Results. We assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors. Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to an August 2005 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions. We plan to re invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may also in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. As our revenues increase, we expect marketing and sales costs, which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2006 and 55 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. 34 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2006, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2006. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2006 and 90 percent during the same period a year ago. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2006 and 2005. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges, employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services. To the extent that our customer base grows, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. We have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, the costs of upgrading our new development and test data center and allocated overhead. We have 35 Table of Contents historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. We recently upgraded our new development and test data center. We expect the annual cost of this data center to be significant. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. As our revenues increase, we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company, including the cost of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non employees, option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services. These charges have been significant and are reflected in our historical financial results. These amounts do not include the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options, which we will adopt at the start of fiscal 2007. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2006, we owned a 63 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors interest in the ventures results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January 31, 2006, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make 36 Table of Contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, we allocate the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $1,686,000 at January 31, 2006 and $874,000 at January 31, 2005. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the 37 Table of Contents commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2006, we deferred $22.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $14.6 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $14.0 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $15.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $17.1 million at January 31, 2006 and $9.6 million at January 31, 2005. Accounting for Stock Based Awards. We recorded deferred stock based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. We have elected not to record stock based compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant. Prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock in June 2004, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors, including, but not limited to, our operating and financial performance, private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties, issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm. The fair value of our common stock is now determined by the trading price of our stock on the New York Stock Exchange. We amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the four year vesting period of the underlying option awards. As of January 31, 2006, we had an aggregate of $2.5 million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized. On February 1, 2006, which is the start of our fiscal 2007, we will begin to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R (see Recent Accounting Pronouncement below for further discussion). We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce our fiscal 2007 reported results of operations. In the past, we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non employees. For these options and warrants, we recognize stock based compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the Black Scholes option pricing model. As of January 31, 2006, we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to non employees except for options for 50,000 shares of our common stock, all of which will fully vest by July 2007 and have an exercise price of $2.50 per share. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, tax exposure items or adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. During fiscal 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit of $1.3 million, which included a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. The Company continues to maintain a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. Future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity, which was approximately $40.0 million of the total valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, will be recorded to additional paid in capital. 38 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated.

The total number of paying subscribers increased to approximately 399,000 as of January 31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. Our gross profit during the year ended January 31, 2006 was $240.7 million, or 78 percent of revenues, and operating income was $20.1 million. Operating income for the period included a non cash stock based expense of $3.4 million, which consisted primarily of the amortization of our deferred stock based compensation. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $142.9 million, or 81 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $6.5 million. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2005 also included $3.6 million of non cash stock based expense. During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $6.8 million by reducing our valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets. This determination was primarily based on our cumulative profitability over the past several quarters plus the projected current and future taxable income that we expect to realize, particularly in specific tax jurisdictions such as the United States. Additionally, during fiscal 2006, we incurred substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business. We incurred costs related to adding data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the penetration within our existing customer base, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, and developers to broaden and enhance our on demand service. During the year ended January 31, 2006, we generated $95.9 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $55.9 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $296.8 million, as compared to $205.9 million at January 31, 2005, accounts receivable of $76.1 million at January 31, 2006, as compared to $48.9 million at January 31, 2005, and deferred revenue of $169.2 million at January 31, 2006, as compared to $95.9 million at January 31, 2005. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Total revenues were $309.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $176.4 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.5 million, or 76 percent. Subscription and support 41 Table of Contents revenues were $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 399,000 as of January 31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. Professional services and other revenues were $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $27.3 million, or 77 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $35.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $14.6 million in employee related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 60 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2005, an increase of $11.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $3.3 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.3 million in allocated overhead charges. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended January 31, 2006 by $5.5 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, together with the requirement to expense stock options beginning in fiscal 2007, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We believe that our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will approximate recent percentages, exclusive of the new requirement to expense stock options. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $13.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $7.7 million in employee related costs, an increase of $3.6 million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a $1.6 million increase in allocated overhead charges. We increased our research and development headcount by 77 percent since January 31, 2005 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. During the year ended January 31, 2006, we capitalized $1.4 million in development costs associated with planned releases of our application service. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $53.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million in employee related costs, $5.0 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings, advertising and events and a $9.1 million increase in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 72 percent since January 31, 2005 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, 42 Table of Contents during the same period a year ago, an increase of $17.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22.2 million in employee related costs, $4.1 million in professional and outside service costs and $4.5 million in infrastructure related costs, which were offset by $15.0 million in increased allocated charges to non general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 69 percent since January 31, 2005 as we added personnel to support our growth. Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $285,000, which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a $285,000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space. Operating Income. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2006 was $20.1 million. During the same period a year ago, it was $6.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. During the year ended January 31, 2005, interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $7.7 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and was $2.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the $113.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since January 31, 2005. Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the $1.3 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling $7.2 million. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. As of January 31, 2006, we had $7.2 million of deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheet. As of the same date, the Company continues to maintain a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. Future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity, which was approximately $40.0 million of the total valuation allowance as of January 31, 2006, will be recorded to additional paid in capital. To realize the deferred tax assets related to foreign operations, pretax income in those jurisdictions must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized. Historic profits in those jurisdictions have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date. Without the reduction in our valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 would have been approximately 20 percent. This effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. We currently believe that our fiscal 2007 effective tax rate will be significantly higher than in fiscal 2006. Our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of full year income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate, the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction and the impact of the new accounting requirement to expense stock options. The estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items. These actual results could vary from those projected. 43 Table of Contents Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2005 and 2004 Revenues. Total revenues were $176.4 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $96.0 million during fiscal 2004, an increase of $80.4 million, or 84 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $85.8 million, or 89 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005 from approximately 127,000 as of January 31, 2004. Professional services and other revenues were $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2005, compared to $10.2 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2004. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.1 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $18.4 million, or 108 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $17.3 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $16.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily comprised of an increase of $12.1 million in employee related costs, substantially all of which was due to the 80 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2004, an increase of $1.9 million in service delivery costs and an increase of $1.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2005 by $2.3 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our customer base has expanded. The increase in our gross profit was the result of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to serve the increased number of customers and paying subscribers. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $7.0 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $2.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of $2.3 million and an increase of $0.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 57 percent since January 31, 2004 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $54.6 million, or 57 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $41.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $34.3 million in employee related costs, $3.5 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings and event costs and $3.4 million in allocated overhead. Of the $34.3 million increase in employee related costs, $7.0 million was related to the increased amortization expense of deferred commissions. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 76 percent since January 31, 2004 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2005, compared to $16.9 million, or 18 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2004, an increase of $13.4 million. The increase was due to an increase of $8.3 million in employee related costs and $5.1 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 64 percent since January 31, 2004 as we added personnel to support our growth. The increase in professional and 44 Table of Contents outside service costs was due to the cost of being a public company and the added costs of managing a growing business and expanding outside the United States. Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $3.4 million during fiscal 2004 was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In August 2003, we entered into an agreement, releasing us from future obligations for some of the space abandoned, in connection with the landlords lease of this space to another tenant. Accordingly, we recorded a $3.4 million credit to reflect the reversal of the accrual that was directly related with this space. Operating Income. Operating income during fiscal 2005 was $6.5 million. During fiscal 2004, it was $3.7 million, substantially all of which consisted of the lease recovery described above. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income substantially consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances and also includes interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $2.7 million during fiscal 2005 and was $379,000 during fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004. Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income tax expense of $1.2 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to a provision for income tax expense of $541,000 for fiscal 2004. The fiscal 2005 provision for income taxes consists of amounts accrued for our estimated domestic federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax liability as well as an estimate of our foreign income tax expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2006, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million and accounts receivable of $76.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $95.9 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $55.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $47.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $149.2 million during the same period a year ago, which included the investment of most of the proceeds from our initial public offering in June 2004. The net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2006 primarily related to the changes in restricted cash balances and marketable securities and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force. In February 2005, we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of $8.8 million, which included the cost for support for the first year of the license agreement. Additionally, we obtained additional data center capacity and we upgraded our new development and test data center. For these data center resources, our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for the facilities and computer equipment and contracts for certain services. 45 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $15.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $118.9 million during the same period a year ago. In June 2004, we completed the sale of 11.5 million shares of common stock during our initial public offering. The net proceeds from the initial public offering were $113.8 million. During the year ended January 31, 2006, the $15.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and the $727,000 of proceeds from the collection of notes receivable from shareholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations. As of January 31, 2006, we have a total of $3.4 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, Switzerland and Singapore. None of these letters of credit are collateralized. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2010. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for additional data center capacity and the new development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2006, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 825 $ 638 $ 187 $ $ Operating lease obligations: Office space 76,603 20,522 23,624 19,155 13,302 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 49,250 20,758 28,362 130 Contractual commitments 350 350 Lease abandonment liabilities and other 1,341 186 762 393 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. 46 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R on February 1, 2006, which is the start of our next fiscal year. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will materially reduce our reported results of operations. The full impact is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when additional employees that we plan to hire commence employment, the outcome of our current assessment of different long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses. Had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the total stock based expense for all awards before the tax benefit would have approximated the pro forma impact of expensing options as described in Note 1 to the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, SFAS 123R requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. We currently classify these tax benefits as a source of cash provided by operating activities. These benefits totaled $3,662,000 during the year ended January 31, 2006 and $798,000 for the comparable period a year ago. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million at January 31, 2006. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points could result in a $1.6 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $205.9 million. The fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million. 47 Table of Contents
