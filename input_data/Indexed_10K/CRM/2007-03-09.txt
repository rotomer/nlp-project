ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are the leading provider, based on market share, of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand, according to a December 2006 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition. We plan to re invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity; upgrading our development and test data center; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 51 percent of our total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2007 and 48 percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2007, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 90 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although 36 Table of Contents terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software. To date, the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, including stock based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services. We have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding 37 Table of Contents our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business, international expansion and operations as a public company, including the continuing cost of our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non employee directors. As described below, on February 1, 2006 we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R, which requires companies to expense their stock option awards. We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods. These charges are significant and are reflected in our financial results. Prior to February 1, 2006, we recognized stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non employees and option grants to employees in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, or APB 25. Under APB 25, the compensation expense of stock options to employees was measured based on the difference in the deemed fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the option on the date of the grant These differences occurred prior to our June 2004 initial public offering. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2007, we owned a 65 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors interest in the ventures results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January 31, 2007, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture had not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $5,232,000 at January 31, 2007 and $1,686,000 at January 31, 2006. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2007, we deferred $37.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $23.4 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $22.1 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $14.6 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $31.6 million at January 31, 2007 and $17.1 million at January 31, 2006. 39 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock Based Awards. Effective February 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we have not restated results for prior periods. Prior to February 1, 2006, we accounted for share based compensation under APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all employee share based payments, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized as expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock based expense of $39.2 million during fiscal 2007. The requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2007, we had an aggregate of $152.4 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $53.5 million during fiscal 2008; $47.3 million during fiscal 2009; $36.5 million during fiscal 2010; and $15.1 million during fiscal 2011. The expected amortization reflects only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2007 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods. The impact of SFAS 123R in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses. Additionally, the application of SFAS 123R requires the use of an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. During fiscal 2007, we awarded 876,303 restricted stock units to our employees. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. During fiscal 2007, the fair value of the restricted units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, which ranged from $29.35 to $39.35 per share, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, prior year tax exposure items or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non deductible expenses arising from SFAS 123R and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except customer and subscriber data).

The adoption of this accounting pronouncement resulted in a significant reduction in our financial operating results. During fiscal 2007, our net income was $481,000, which included $39.2 million of stock based expenses, or 8 percent of total revenue. Net income during the same period a year ago was $28.5 million. Net income during the year ended January 31, 2006 included a tax benefit of approximately $7.2 million which resulted from the reduction of our valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets. This determination was primarily based on our cumulative profitability over the past several quarters plus the projected current and future taxable income that expected to be realized, particularly in specific tax jurisdictions such as the United States. The net income for the year ended January 31, 2006 also included $3.4 million of stock based expenses, or 1 percent of total revenue. Revenues during fiscal 2007 were $497.1 million, an increase of 60 percent over the same period a year ago. The total number of paying subscriptions increased to approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007 from approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006. Our gross profit during fiscal 2007 was $378.2 million, or 76 percent of revenues, and included stock based expenses of $5.5 million. Our operating loss was $3.6 million and included stock based expenses of $39.2 million. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $240.7 million, or 78 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $20.1 million. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2006 also included $3.4 million of stock based expense. Additionally, during fiscal 2007, we re invested our revenue growth in an effort to expand our business. We incurred costs related to our data center capacity and upgrading our development and test data center. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, developers to broaden and enhance our on demand service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business. During fiscal 2007, we generated $111.2 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $95.9 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $412.5 million, as compared to $296.8 million at January 31, 2006, accounts receivable of $128.7 million at January 31, 2007, as compared to $76.1 million at January 31, 2006, and deferred revenue of $284.1 million at January 31, 2007, as compared to $169.2 million at January 31, 2006. 43 Table of Contents On April 10, 2006, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Sendia Corporation, a privately held on demand wireless application company based in Santa Monica, California, for $15.5 million in cash including acquisition costs. We believe Sendias solution will provide our customers with the increased ability to access on demand applications via mobile handheld devices. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Total revenues were $497.1 million for the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $309.9 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $187.2 million, or 60 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007 from approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006. Professional services and other revenues were $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $46.7 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $118.9 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $49.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in employee related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 59 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2006, an increase of $4.9 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $15.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $5.4 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $2.1 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2007 by $12.0 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded and includes more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, together with the requirement to expense stock options, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2008. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our on demand application service. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $44.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $21.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $12.0 million in employee related costs, an increase of $4.2 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $2.7 million in depreciation expense, equipment and service costs and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 84 percent since January 31, 2006 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the 44 Table of Contents same period a year ago, an increase of $103.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $71.4 million in employee related costs, $17.1 million in stock based expenses, $2.9 million in marketing, advertising and event costs, $1.5 million in partner referral fees and $9.2 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 55 percent since January 31, 2006 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $36.3 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $28.8 million in employee related costs, $9.5 million in stock based expenses, $6.5 million in infrastructure related costs and $5.5 million in professional and outside service costs, which were primarily offset by $13.7 million in increased allocated charges to non general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 62 percent since January 31, 2006 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Operating loss during the year ended January 31, 2007 was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During the same period a year ago, operating income was $20.1 million and included $3.4 million of stock based expenses. The increase in our revenues was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. Interest income was $15.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and was $7.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and increased market interest rates. (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during the year ended January 31, 2007, compared to a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the fiscal 2006 $1.3 million income tax benefit was a $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. Prior to the third quarter of last year, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. The (provision) benefit amounts equated to an effective tax rate of 78 percent for the current period and a negative 5 percent for the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2007 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly higher than for the same period a year ago primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized, certain nondeductible stock based expenses resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance a year ago. Additionally, the impact of adopting SFAS 123R and the business combination accounting adjustments from the acquisition of Sendia Corporation had a significant impact on the calculation of our effective tax rate because these charges significantly lowered our income before provision for income taxes and minority interest and we were not able to recognize a full income tax benefit for the stock based expenses and foreign losses. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2006 and 2005 Revenues. Total revenues were $309.9 million for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $176.4 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $133.5 million, or 76 percent. Subscription and support 45 Table of Contents revenues were $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $158.0 million, or 90 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscribers to approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006 from approximately 227,000 as of January 31, 2005. Professional services and other revenues were $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $18.4 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $35.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $27.3 million, or 77 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $33.5 million, or 19 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $35.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $14.6 million in employee related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 60 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2005, an increase of $11.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $1.5 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $3.3 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.3 million in allocated overhead charges. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended January 31, 2006 by $5.5 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $9.8 million, or 5 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $13.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $7.7 million in employee related costs, an increase of $3.6 million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a $1.6 million increase in allocated overhead charges. We increased our research and development headcount by 77 percent since January 31, 2005 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. During the year ended January 31, 2006, we capitalized $1.4 million in development costs associated with planned releases of our application service. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $96.3 million, or 55 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $53.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $37.9 million in employee related costs, $5.0 million in marketing spending related to new service offerings, advertising and events and a $9.1 million increase in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 72 percent since January 31, 2005 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $48.0 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to $30.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $17.7 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $22.2 million in employee related costs, $4.1 million in professional and outside service costs and $4.5 million in infrastructure related costs, which were offset by $15.0 million in increased allocated charges to non general and administrative departments. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 69 percent since January 31, 2005 as we added personnel to support our growth. 46 Table of Contents Lease Recovery. The lease recovery of $285,000, which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2006, was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the San Francisco, California office space that we abandoned in December 2001. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value. Accordingly, we recorded a $285,000 credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space. Operating Income. Operating income during the year ended January 31, 2006 was $20.1 million. During the same period a year ago, it was $6.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues, most of which was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. During the year ended January 31, 2005, interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options. None of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the Company and all of them repaid their loan balances by February 28, 2005. Interest income was $7.7 million during the year ended January 31, 2006 and was $2.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the $113.8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in June 2004 and the cash generated by operating activities since January 31, 2005. Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes. We recorded a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the year ended January 31, 2006, compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.2 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the $1.3 million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling $7.2 million. Prior to fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. As of January 31, 2006, we had $7.2 million of deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheet. As of January 31, 2006, we maintained a $41.8 million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries. This effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million and accounts receivable of $128.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $111.2 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and $95.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $168.6 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and $47.8 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2007 primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures 47 Table of Contents associated with the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force. In April 2006, we acquired Sendia Corporation for $15.5 million including acquisition costs and in December 2006, we increased our ownership interest in Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com from 63 percent to 65 percent by purchasing some shares held by a minority partner for $2.8 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $45.0 million during the year ended January 31, 2007 and $15.8 million during the same period a year ago. During the year ended January 31, 2007, the $29.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and $16.6 million of tax benefits from employee stock plans were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations. As of January 31, 2007, we have a total of $5.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York, Singapore and Australia. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2015. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2007, the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long term liability were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 185 $ 179 $ 6 $ $ Operating lease obligations: Office space 136,679 24,574 44,779 32,476 34,850 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 60,794 34,057 26,728 9 Contractual commitments 1,125 1,125 Lease abandonment liabilities and other 2,107 196 756 267 888 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our marketing and sales activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services, the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with Web hosting 48 Table of Contents and the continuing market acceptance of our services. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. During fiscal 2008, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources to take these actions, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has been met. FIN 48 also provides guidance on the recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial position and results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). The purpose of SFAS No. 157 is to define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and enhance disclosures about fair value measurements. The measurement and disclosure requirements are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently assessing whether adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have an impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million at January 31, 2007. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings. The cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points could result in a $2.8 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2006, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $296.8 million. The fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $1.6 million. 49 Table of Contents
