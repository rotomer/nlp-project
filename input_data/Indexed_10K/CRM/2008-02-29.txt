ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are the leading provider, based on revenues and market share, of software on demand, according to a July 2007 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive CRM service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our on demand CRM application service in February 2000. In order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions and upgrade our customers to more fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition. We plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally; hiring additional personnel, particularly in customer related areas; expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; adding to our infrastructure to support our growth; and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business. Additionally, in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 50 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2008 and 51 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2008, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2008. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues. Other revenues consist primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2008. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers 36 Table of Contents typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, or SAB 104, and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, or EITF 00 21. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and estimates Revenue Recognition below. As we introduce new service offerings such as Unlimited Edition, Partner Edition and Salesforce Sandbox, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 8 percent and 5 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2008 and 2007 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of additional data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, including stock based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our consulting services. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we have obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the United States and we intend to open a data center in Asia in fiscal 2009. We expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in 37 Table of Contents the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non employee directors. We account for stock based expenses pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R which we adopted on February 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires that share based payments, including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. As of January 31, 2008, we owned a 65 percent interest in the joint venture. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors interest in the ventures results, exclusive of intercompany charges. Through January 31, 2008, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture has not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 38 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SAB 104 and EITF 00 21. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $13,922,000 at January 31, 2008 and $5,232,000 at January 31, 2007. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2008, we deferred $62.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $42.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $37.9 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $23.4 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $52.1 million at January 31, 2008 and $31.6 million at January 31, 2007. 39 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock Based Awards. We account for share based compensation under SFAS 123R. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock based expense of $55.2 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2008. The requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2008, we had an aggregate of $220.5 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $81.1 million during fiscal 2009; $69.8 million during fiscal 2010; $48.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $21.5 million during fiscal 2012. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2008 and assumes no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods. We grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise. As of January 31, 2008, we would incur as an operating expense in excess of $5.0 million for these taxes if all vested awards outstanding by employees in these foreign jurisdictions were exercised. This amount is based on the number of vested awards held and the market price of our common stock as of January 31, 2008. The timing of when employees in these foreign jurisdictions exercise their vested awards could materially affect our future results of operations in a particular period. The impact of SFAS 123R in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses. Additionally, the application of SFAS 123R requires the use of an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2008, there were 1,717,290 restricted stock units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non deductible expenses arising from SFAS 123R and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).

Net income during the same period a year ago was $481,000, which included $39.2 million of stock based expenses, or 8 percent of total revenue. Revenues during fiscal 2008 were $748.7 million, an increase of 51 percent over the same period a year ago. The total number of paying subscriptions increased to approximately 1.1 million as of January 31, 2008 from approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007. Our gross profit during fiscal 2008 was $577.1 million, or 77 percent of revenues, and included stock based expenses of $7.9 million. Our operating income was $20.3 million and included stock based expenses of $55.2 million. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $378.2 million, or 76 percent of revenues, and had an operating loss of $3.6 million. The operating loss for fiscal 2007 included $39.2 million of stock based expense. During fiscal 2008, we re invested our revenue growth in an effort to expand our business. Additionally, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers, professional services personnel to support our consulting services, developers to broaden and enhance our on demand service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business. During fiscal 2008, we generated $204.3 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $111.2 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $669.8 million, as compared to $412.5 million at January 31, 2007, accounts receivable of $220.1 million at January 31, 2008, as compared to $128.7 million at January 31, 2007, and deferred revenue, current and noncurrent of $480.9 million at January 31, 2008, as compared to $284.1 million at January 31, 2007. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2008 and 2007 Revenues. Total revenues were $748.7 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $497.1 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $251.6 million, or 51 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $680.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due 43 Table of Contents primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 1.1 million as of January 31, 2008 from approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007. Professional services and other revenues were $68.1 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $190.7 million, or 25 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $81.2 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a larger percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $171.6 million, or 23 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $118.9 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $52.7 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $16.6 million in employee related costs, an increase of $2.4 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $14.0 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $4.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $10.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2008 by $12.2 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded to include more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services. The timing of these additional expenses, as well as the costs related to our new data center in Asia, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our on demand application service. Additionally, as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract, our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $63.8 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $44.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $19.2 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $15.0 million in employee related costs, an increase of $1.8 million in stock based expenses, and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 32 percent since January 31, 2007 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $376.5 million, or 50 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $123.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $85.9 million in employee related costs, $7.0 million in stock based expenses, $10.8 million in advertising costs, $2.2 million in marketing and event costs, $1.7 million in partner referral fees and $13.9 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 27 percent since January 31, 2007 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. 44 Table of Contents General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $116.5 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2008, compared to $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $32.2 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, stock based expenses, infrastructure related costs, professional and outside service costs and a legal settlement. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 33 percent since January 31, 2007 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Operating income during fiscal 2008 was $20.3 million and included $55.2 million of stock based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During the same period a year ago, operating loss was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock based expenses. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. Interest income was $24.5 million during fiscal 2008 and was $15.0 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises. Gain on Sale of Investment. Gain on sale of investment consists of the gain we recorded when we sold our shares in a privately held professional service corporation. The gain was $1.3 million for the fiscal 2008, Provision for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $23.4 million during fiscal 2008, compared to a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate decreased to 51 percent for fiscal 2008 compared to 78 percent for the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2008 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly lower than for the same period a year ago primarily due to a reduced proportion of foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to SFAS 123R was $18.5 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2007 and 2006 Revenues. Total revenues were $497.1 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $309.9 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $187.2 million, or 60 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007, compared to $280.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to the increase in the number of paying subscriptions to approximately 646,000 as of January 31, 2007 from approximately 393,000 as of January 31, 2006. Professional services and other revenues were $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007, compared to $29.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007, compared to $62.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $46.7 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues was $118.9 million, or 24 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $69.1 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of 45 Table of Contents $49.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $17.0 million in employee related costs, primarily all of which was due to the 59 percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since January 31, 2006, an increase of $4.9 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $15.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity, an increase of $3.9 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $5.4 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $2.1 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2007 by $12.0 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base expanded and includes more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally. Research and Development. Research and development expenses were $44.6 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $23.3 million, or 8 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $21.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $12.0 million in employee related costs, an increase of $4.2 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $2.7 million in depreciation expense, equipment and service costs and an increase of $2.4 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 84 percent since January 31, 2006 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses were $252.9 million, or 51 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $149.6 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $103.3 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $71.4 million in employee related costs, $17.1 million in stock based expenses, $2.9 million in marketing, advertising and event costs, $1.5 million in partner referral fees and $9.2 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 55 percent since January 31, 2006 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses were $84.3 million, or 17 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, compared to $47.7 million, or 16 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $36.6 million. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, stock based expenses, infrastructure related costs and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 62 percent since January 31, 2006 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income (Loss). Operating loss during fiscal 2007 was $3.6 million and included $39.2 million of stock based expenses related to SFAS 123R. During the same period a year ago, operating income was $20.1 million and included $3.4 million of stock based expenses. The increase in our revenues was re invested in an effort to expand our business. Interest Income. Interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances. Interest income was $15.0 million during fiscal 2007 and was $7.7 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the cash generated by operating activities and increased market interest rates. (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $9.8 million during fiscal 2007, compared to a benefit for income taxes of $1.3 million during the same period a year ago. Included in the fiscal 2006 $1.3 million income tax benefit was a $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets. 46 Table of Contents The (provision) benefit amounts equated to an effective tax rate of 78 percent for fiscal 2007 and a negative 5 percent for the same period a year ago. The fiscal 2007 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly higher than for the same period a year ago primarily due to foreign losses for which no tax benefit can be realized, certain nondeductible stock based expenses resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and the $7.2 million reversal of the valuation allowance a year ago. Additionally, the impact of adopting SFAS 123R and the business combination accounting adjustments from the acquisition of Sendia Corporation had a significant impact on the calculation of our effective tax rate because these charges significantly lowered our income before provision for income taxes and minority interest and we were not able to recognize a full income tax benefit for the stock based expenses and foreign losses. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2008, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million and accounts receivable of $220.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $204.3 million during fiscal 2008 and $111.2 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services, changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments, and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $102.7 million during fiscal 2008 and $168.6 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2008 primarily related to the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements, development of internal use software and the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure, number of offices around the world and work force. Additionally, in March 2007, we acquired additional developed technology for $5.3 million in cash. Net cash provided by financing activities was $92.7 million during fiscal 2008 and $45.0 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2008 substantially consisted of $60.9 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $32.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans. As of January 31, 2008, we have a total of $5.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2015. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. 47 Table of Contents Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for additional data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. We also have long term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments. At January 31, 2008, the future non cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5 Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 7 $ 7 $ $ $ Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 259,754 47,501 79,772 68,549 63,932 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 53,475 34,577 18,898 Contractual commitments 23,972 23,972 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) on February 1, 2007. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2009, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 (FSP 157 1) and FSP 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157 2). FSP 157 1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope. FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 48 Table of Contents 2010. The measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial assets and financial liabilities are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, the resulting fair values calculated under SFAS No. 157 after adoption may be different from the fair values that would have been calculated under previous guidance. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements when it is applied to non financial assets and non financial liabilities beginning in the first quarter of 2010. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million at January 31, 2008. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points could result in a $3.2 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2007, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $412.5 million. The fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $2.8 million. 49 Table of Contents
