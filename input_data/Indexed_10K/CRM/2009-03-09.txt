ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations and liquidity. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are the leading provider, based on revenues and market share, of software on demand, according to a July 2008 report by IDC. We provide a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. Approximately 55,400 customers worldwide use salesforce.com to manage their customer, sales and operational data. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build Software as a Service applications. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM ; Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; Continuing to lead the industry transformation to cloud computing; and Encouraging the development of third party applications on our Force.com platform. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of new and improved features; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third party developers willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our application service or delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third party applications on our Force.com platform. We also plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity both domestically and internationally and, towards this end, we are opening a new data center in Singapore in fiscal 2010. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer related areas and research and development. During the year ended January 31, 2009, we added 960 employees and our headcount as of January 31, 2009 was 3,566. We also plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies; expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business; add to our infrastructure to support our growth. Additionally, in 36 Table of Contents our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, services and technologies. In August 2008, we acquired InStranet, Inc. which offers a knowledge management application for business to consumer call centers. We acquired InStranet, Inc. for its developed technology in order to expand our CRM customer service and support offerings in the customer service and support market. Additionally during the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our ownership in our Japanese joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 50 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2009 and the same for the period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2009, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2009. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 91 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2009. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, or SAB 104, and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, or EITF 00 21. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire 37 Table of Contents arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 7 percent and 8 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. The following table sets forth our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances as of the end of each fiscal quarter: (in thousands) April 30,2008 July 31,2008 October 31,2008 January 31,2009 Fiscal 2009 Accounts receivable, net $ 143,909 $ 146,982 $ 157,680 $ 266,555 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 470,297 479,546 469,534 594,026 April 30,2007 July 31,2007 October 31,2007 January 31,2008 Fiscal 2008 Accounts receivable, net $ 105,013 $ 114,046 $ 121,961 $ 220,061 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 295,672 321,852 340,808 480,894 April 30,2006 July 31,2006 October 31,2006 January 31,2007 Fiscal 2007 Accounts receivable, net $ 72,337 $ 75,704 $ 82,808 $ 128,693 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 182,036 202,836 219,431 284,063 Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, costs associated with website development activities, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, including stock based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs. 38 Table of Contents We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in a particular quarterly period. For example, we intend to open a data center in Singapore in fiscal 2010. We expect the annual cost to be significant. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base, expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non employee directors. We account for stock based expenses pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123R which we adopted on February 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires that share based payments, including grants of employee stock options be recognized as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges are significant and we expect them to increase in absolute dollars in the future. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com, with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we increased our ownership interest in the joint venture from 65 percent to 72 percent. Because of this majority interest, we consolidate the ventures financial results, which are reflected in each revenue, cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations. We then record minority interest, which reflects the minority investors interest in the ventures results. Through January 31, 2009, the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture have not been significant. While we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in Japan in order to add new customers, we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the Japanese joint venture will not be significant. 39 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of SAB 104 and EITF 00 21. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $17.3 million at January 31, 2009 and $13.9 million at January 31, 2008. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non cancelable terms of the related 40 Table of Contents subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2009, we deferred $63.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $58.7 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $62.7 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $42.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $57.1 million at January 31, 2009 and $52.1 million at January 31, 2008. Accounting for Stock Based Awards. We account for share based compensation under SFAS 123R. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock based expense of $77.4 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2009. The requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2009, we had an aggregate of $261.3 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $105.1 million during fiscal 2010; $83.0 million during fiscal 2011; $55.0 million during fiscal 2012; and $18.2 million during fiscal 2013. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2009 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods. We grant stock options and restricted stock units to employees throughout the world. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we are obligated for the payroll or social tax costs when employees exercise their vested awards. Pursuant to SFAS 123R, we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs at the time of the exercise. The impact of SFAS 123R in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses. Additionally, the application of SFAS 123R requires the use of an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2009, there were 2.5 million restricted stock units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock units to our employees in the future. The restricted stock units, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit, have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. 41 Table of Contents Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non deductible expenses arising from SFAS 123R and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Net income during the same period a year ago was $18.4 million, which included $55.2 million of stock based expenses, or 7 percent of total revenue. Revenues during fiscal 2009 were $1,076.8 million, an increase of 44 percent over the same period a year ago. Our gross profit during fiscal 2009 was $856.3 million, or 80 percent of revenues, and included stock based expenses of $11.1 million. Our operating income was $63.7 million and included stock based expenses of $77.4 million. During the same period a year ago, we generated a gross profit of $577.1 million, or 77 percent of revenues, and had operating income of $20.3 million. Operating income for fiscal 2008 included $55.2 million of stock based expenses. During fiscal 2009, we added sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing the sale of subscriptions to existing customers, developers to broaden and enhance our enterprise cloud computing service and we invested in our infrastructure to meet the demands of an expanding business. During fiscal 2009, we generated $229.6 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $204.3 million during the same period a year ago. At January 31, 2009, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $882.6 million, as compared to $669.8 million at January 31, 2008, accounts receivable of $266.6 million at January 31, 2009, as compared to $220.1 million at January 31, 2008, and deferred revenue, current and noncurrent of $594.0 million at January 31, 2009, as compared to $480.9 million at January 31, 2008. Fiscal Years Ended January 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance (In thousands) 2009 2008 Dollars Percent Subscription and support $ 984,574 $ 680,581 $ 303,993 45 % Professional services and other 92,195 68,119 24,076 35 % Total revenues $ 1,076,769 $ 748,700 $ 328,069 44 % Total revenues were $1,076.8 million for fiscal 2009, compared to $748.7 million during the same period a year ago, an increase of $328.1 million, or 44 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $984.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $680.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to an increased number of new customers, additional paying subscriptions from existing customers, and customers who have upgraded. Professional services and other revenues were $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $68.1 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. 44 Table of Contents Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009, compared to $190.7 million, or 25 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $109.6 million, or 57 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to the increase in total revenues for the year ended January 31, 2009 as compared the same period year ago. The foreign currency impact compared to the same period a year ago was an increase of $6.6 million. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a larger percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2009 2008 Subscription and support $ 127,082 $ 91,268 $ 35,814 Professional services and other 93,389 80,323 13,066 Total cost of revenues $ 220,471 $ 171,591 $ 48,880 Percent of total revenues 20 % 23 % Cost of revenues was $220.5 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2009, compared to $171.6 million, or 23 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $48.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $13.8 million in employee related costs, an increase of $3.1 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $9.9 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $7.2 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $10.7 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $3.3 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2009 by $1.2 million as compared to $12.2 million during fiscal 2008. This reduction was the result of increasing the utilization of existing professional services staff, utilizing more outside subcontractors and not significantly increasing professional services headcount. As described above, we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, as well as the costs related to our new data center in Singapore, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues. We expect the cost of professional services and other revenue to continue to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2010. We plan to make this investment since our professional services are designed to facilitate the adoption of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Additionally, as more professional service arrangements are accounted for as a single unit of accounting with the related subscription service and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription contract, our costs of professional services will exceed the related revenue recognized.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $27.4 million in employee related costs, an 45 Table of Contents increase of $3.5 million in stock based expenses, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 61 percent since January 31, 2008 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Marketing and Sales.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $94.1 million in employee related costs, $10.6 million in stock based expenses, $28.9 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.6 million in partner referral fees, $1.4 million of amortized purchased intangibles and $20.3 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 40 percent since January 31, 2008 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base.

The increase was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, stock based expenses, infrastructure related costs, and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 30 percent since January 31, 2008 as we added personnel to support our growth. Operating Income.

Interest, net was $22.7 million during fiscal 2009 and was $24.5 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.8 million loss for our investment in marketable securities as discussed under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Due to the current decline in market interest rates since last year and our focus on capital preservation, investment income declined when compared to the same periods in the previous year. Gain on Sale of Investment. Gain on sale of investment of $1.3 million for fiscal 2008 consists of the gain we recorded when we sold our shares in a privately held professional service corporation. Other income (expense).

The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to SFAS 123R was $26.3 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes.

Subscription and support revenues were $680.6 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $451.7 million, or 91 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to an increased number of new customers, additional paying subscriptions from existing customers, and customers who have upgraded. Professional 47 Table of Contents services and other revenues were $68.1 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $45.4 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2007. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscriptions and customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $190.7 million, or 25 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2008, compared to $109.5 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2007, an increase of $81.2 million, or 74 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. Cost of Revenues.

The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $16.6 million in employee related costs, an increase of $2.4 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $14.0 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $4.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $10.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of $4.7 million in allocated overhead. The cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during fiscal 2008 by $12.2 million. We increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the current and anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded to include more large businesses and as we have expanded internationally.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 51 percent for fiscal 2008 compared to 78 percent for fiscal 2007. The fiscal 2008 provision as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes and minority interest was significantly lower than for fiscal 2007 primarily due to a reduced proportion of foreign losses for which no tax benefit could be realized. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations related to SFAS 123R was $18.5 million for fiscal 2008. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million, and accounts receivable of $266.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $229.6 million during fiscal 2009 and $204.3 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income; sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above; the timing of commission and bonus payments; collections from large enterprise customers; add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization; and, the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $121.0 million during fiscal 2009 and $102.7 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2009 primarily related to the acquisition of InStranet, Inc, and the purchase of shares of Salesforce Japan from the minority shareholders. In addition, our investing activities included the investment of operating cash balances and capital expenditures in leasehold improvements, and the purchase of software licenses, computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure, number of offices around the world and work force. We expanded one of our existing software license agreements to provide additional capacity in our business operations at a cost of $8.0 million. The Company during the year invested approximately $2.0 million in system integrators and software as a service ISVs. Net cash provided by financing activities was $96.9 million during fiscal 2009 and $92.7 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2009 substantially consisted of $43.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $54.6 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans. 50 Table of Contents Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, asset backed securities and an investment in The Reserve Primary Fund (The Reserve Fund), a money market mutual fund that suspended redemptions and is in the process of being liquidated. As of January 31, 2009 our investment portfolio included $19.5 million invested in The Reserve Fund with an estimated fair value of $18.3 million. During the year ended January 31, 2009 we recorded a $1.2 million loss related to this decline in fair value that is considered other than temporary. While we believe we have the rights to the recovery of the entire $19.5 million investment, we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive. Therefore, we have recorded the aforementioned other than temporary loss. Subsequent to January 31, 2009 we received an additional $6.1 million redemption from The Reserve Fund. As of January 31, 2009, we have a total of $8.3 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in San Francisco, California, New York City, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through December 2016. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for data center capacity and the development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2009, the future non cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years (in thousands) Capital lease obligations $ 6,444 $ 2,394 $ 4,050 $ $ Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 257,245 49,502 81,204 67,025 59,514 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 55,391 31,001 24,390 Contractual commitments $ 1,526 1,234 292 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48) on February 1, 2007. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2010, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in other businesses, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FSP No. 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP No. 142 3) that amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. FSP No. 142 3 requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under SFAS No. 141(R). The FSP also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible assets expected future cash flows are affected by an entitys intent and or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. FSP No. 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of FSP No. 142 3 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). The standard requires additional quantitative disclosures (provided in tabular form) and qualitative disclosures for derivative instruments. The required disclosures include how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; the relative volume of derivative activity; the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments; the accounting treatment for those derivative instruments formally designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge relationship; and the existence and nature of credit risk related contingent features for derivatives. SFAS 161 does not change the accounting treatment for derivative instruments. SFAS 161 is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 (FSP 157 1) and FSP 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157 2). FSP 157 1 amends SFAS No. 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from its scope, and was effective upon initial adoption of SFAS No. 157. FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements when it is applied to non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). Under SFAS 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred; that restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date; and that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes. In addition, acquired in process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life. SFAS 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of February 1, 2009, The adoption of SFAS 141(R) is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 52 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 or SFAS 160. The standard changes the accounting for non controlling (minority) interests in consolidated financial statements including the requirements to classify non controlling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders equity, and the elimination of minority interest accounting in results of operations with earnings attributable to non controlling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings. Additionally, SFAS 160 revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parents controlling ownership interest. Should we increase our ownership interest in Salesforce Japan, the cost would be recorded as a reduction of our stockholders equity as opposed to accounting for the purchase as a step acquisition which requires an allocation of the purchase price. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 160 will not have a material impact on our results of operations and consolidated balance sheet. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. The hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Prior to October 31, 2008, our practice was to settle foreign currency contracts prior to each quarter end because the maturities of the foreign currency contracts were less than 3 months. We have continued our practice of entering into foreign currency contracts with maturities less than 3 months. As of January 31, 2009 the contracts that were not settled are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $882.6 million at January 31, 2009. These amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. All of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under SFAS No. 115. Our marketable securities include corporate notes and obligations, U.S. treasuries, U.S. agency obligations, time deposits, asset backed securities and money market mutual funds. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2009 could result in a $2.3 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model 53 Table of Contents that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. As previously discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources, we have an investment in The Reserve Fund, a money market mutual fund. While we believe we have the rights to the recovery of our entire investment, we cannot predict the ultimate amount that we will receive. At January 31, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $669.8 million. The fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $3.2 million. 54 Table of Contents
