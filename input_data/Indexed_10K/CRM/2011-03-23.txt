ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled of this Annual Report on Form 10 K Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications. We provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise CRM application service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions and enhanced features. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. In 2010 we introduced our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our CRM service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties. We also introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real time. Our objective is to be the leading provider of CRM application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our existing CRM applications and extending into new functional areas within CRM; Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; Continuing to lead the industry transformation to the next phase of cloud computing; and Encouraging the development of third party applications on our Force.com cloud computing platform. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third party developers willingness to develop applications on our platform; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our application service, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third party applications on our Force.com platform. We plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity. We also plan to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans, we intend to continue focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. 33 Table of Contents Additionally, we plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; continue to develop our brands; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings; develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies; and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. As such, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2012 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 to be significantly lower than diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011. In November 2010, we paid $278.0 million in cash for approximately 14 acres of undeveloped real estate in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage, which we plan to develop into our global headquarters. During fiscal 2011 we acquired several companies to strengthen and extend our service offerings. We spent approximately $403.3 million, net of cash acquired, for these companies. In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist with our sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, we acquired SunBridges and other shareholders interest in, and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of, Salesforce Japan for cash payments totaling $172.0 million. In fiscal 2010, we issued at par $575.0 million 0.75% convertible senior notes (notes) due on January 15, 2015. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, based on the terms of the Notes, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 48 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2011 and 46 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2011, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011. Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service, and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2011. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service, varying service types of offering and the subscription price of our service. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing service. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer authorized users, and each such user is who we call a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than 5 percent of our revenues during fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009. 34 Table of Contents Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. We generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition below. As we introduce new service offerings, we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements. As a result, when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value, the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately, and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In such situations, we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract. Approximately 6 percent of our total deferred revenue as of January 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively, related to deferred professional services revenue. At the start of fiscal 2012 we will be adopting the provisions of ASU 2009 13. Adopting this provision will change our accounting for multiple element arrangements, see Recent Accounting Pronouncement. Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles, with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Additionally, our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. 35 Table of Contents Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter. (in thousands) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 October 31,2010 January 31,2011 Fiscal 2011 Accounts receivable, net $ 183,612 $ 228,550 $ 258,764 $ 426,943 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 664,529 683,019 694,557 934,941 April 30,2009 July 31,2009 October 31,2009 January 31,2010 Fiscal 2010 Accounts receivable, net $ 145,869 $ 168,842 $ 191,297 $ 320,956 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 549,373 549,010 545,435 704,348 April 30,2008 July 31,2008 October 31,2008 January 31,2009 Fiscal 2009 Accounts receivable, net $ 143,909 $ 146,982 $ 157,680 $ 266,555 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 470,297 479,546 469,534 594,026 Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, including stock based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. For example, we plan to open additional data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies. 36 Table of Contents Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for finance and accounting, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non employee directors. We recognize our share based payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. If our grant activity remains consistent and our stock price increases in the future, stock based expenses will rise. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. Joint Venture In December 2000, we established a Japanese joint venture, Kabushiki Kaisha salesforce.com (Salesforce Japan), with SunBridge, Inc., a Japanese corporation, to assist us with our sales efforts in Japan. During fiscal 2011, we acquired SunBridges and other shareholders interest in, and increased our ownership from 72 percent to 100 percent of, Salesforce Japan. As a result of our purchase of the shares held by SunBridge, the joint venture agreement terminated according to its terms. As we did not obtain 100 percent ownership until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2011, which reflects the interest that we did not control in Salesforce Japans results in fiscal 2011 and all prior years presented. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the collection of our fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our arrangements do not contain general rights of return. 37 Table of Contents We recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract. As part of their subscription agreements, customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost. In situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology, we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted. Once delivery occurs, we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term. Consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable. When accounted for separately, revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. The majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, such as an arrangement that includes subscription, premium support, consulting or training services, we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately. In determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement: availability of the consulting services from other vendors, whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements, the nature of the consulting services, the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the consulting work. If a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract. Additionally, in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized. The deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $28.1 million at January 31, 2011 and $19.1 million at January 31, 2010. Such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets, net. Accounting for Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2011, we deferred $121.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $80.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $82.3 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $63.9 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $116.6 million at January 31, 2011 and $75.5 million at January 31, 2010. Business Combinations. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We use the best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to 38 Table of Contents goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowances or contingencys estimated value, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations. Accounting for Stock Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years. We recognized stock based expense of $120.4 million, or 7 percent of revenue, during fiscal 2011. The requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2011, we had an aggregate of $559.8 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $195.1 million during fiscal 2012; $157.9 million during fiscal 2013; $129.6 million during fiscal 2014; $76.8 million during fiscal 2015 and $0.4 million during fiscal 2016. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2011 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods, which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs, as applicable by jurisdiction, when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses. Additionally, we are required to use an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2011, there were 3.2 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future. The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vest over 4 years. The fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Accounting for Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and accounting principles. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth selected data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).

Fiscal Year Ended January 31, Variance (In thousands) 2011 2010 Dollars Percent Subscription and support $ 1,551,145 $ 1,209,472 $ 341,673 28 % Professional services and other 105,994 96,111 9,883 10 % Total revenues $ 1,657,139 $ 1,305,583 $ 351,556 27 % Total revenues were $1.7 billion for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.3 billion during the same period a year ago, an increase of $351.6 million, or 27 percent. Subscription and support revenues were $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2011 has remained substantially consistent relative to fiscal 2010. Professional services and other revenues were $106.0 million, or 6 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $140.3 million, or 37 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, and our focus on marketing our service internationally. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight decrease in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of reducing our aggregate revenues by $7.6 million compared to the same period a year ago. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the Americas to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide. 42 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Subscription and support $ 208,243 $ 159,172 $ 49,071 Professional services and other 115,570 98,753 16,817 Total cost of revenues $ 323,813 $ 257,925 $ 65,888 Percent of total revenues 20 % 20 % Cost of revenues was $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $257.9 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $65.9 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $22.6 million in employee related costs, an increase of $9.2 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts in increasing data center capacity, an increase of $16.6 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, an increase of $13.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $3.6 million in allocated overhead, offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in stock based expenses. The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2011 by $9.6 million as compared to $2.6 million during fiscal 2010, primarily due to an increase in the cost related to professional services headcount. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service. The timing of these additional expenses, will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. We expect the cost of professional services to continue to exceed revenue from professional services during fiscal 2012. We believe that this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our application service. Research and Development. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Research and development $ 187,887 $ 131,897 $ 55,990 Percent of total revenues 11 % 10 % Research and development expenses were $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $131.9 million, or 10 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $56.0 million. The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $42.0 million in employee related costs, an increase of $5.8 million in stock based expenses, and an increase of $5.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 47 percent since January 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Marketing and sales $ 792,029 $ 605,199 $ 186,830 Percent of total revenues 48 % 46 % 43 Table of Contents Marketing and sales expenses were $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2011, compared to $605.2 million, or 46 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $186.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $143.1 million in employee related costs, $16.7 million in stock based expenses, $12.1 million in advertising costs and marketing and event costs, $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization, and $12.6 million in allocated overhead. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 34 percent since January 31, 2010 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative.

The increase was primarily due to increases of $46.8 million in employee related costs, $9.5 million in stock based expenses, and increases in depreciation and amortization, service delivery costs, and professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 30 percent since January 31, 2010 as we added personnel to support our growth. Income from operations.

Investment income was $37.7 million during fiscal 2011 and was $30.4 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to increased realized gains from sales of marketable securities and the increase in marketable securities balances resulting from cash generated by operating activities and the proceeds from stock option exercises and the convertible senior notes. Interest expense.

Interest expense was $24.9 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2011 and was $2.0 million during the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the January 2010 issuance of $575.0 million of convertible senior notes and capital leases associated with equipment acquired to expand our data center capacity. During fiscal 2011, we capitalized $4.0 million of interest costs related to major construction projects, specifically our campus project and our capitalized internal use software development costs. We will continue to capitalize interest on these projects until these assets are ready for service. Other expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Other expense $ (6,025 ) $ (1,299 ) $ (4,726 ) Other expense primarily consists of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense increased due to realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2011 compared to the same period a year ago. Provision for Income Taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2011 2010 Provision for income taxes $ (34,601 ) $ (57,689 ) $ 23,088 Effective tax rate 33 % 41 % The provision for income taxes was $34.6 million during fiscal 2011, compared to $57.7 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for the same period a year ago. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S statutory tax rate, as well as increased tax credits. The extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock based compensation was $44.1 million for the current fiscal year. See Note 7 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income that will impact us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million and $2.7 million related to this tax law change during 2011 and 2010 respectively.

Subscription and support revenues were $1.2 billion, or 93 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $1.0 billion, or 91 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2009. Professional services and other revenues were $96.1 million, or 7 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $92.2 million, or 9 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2009. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying customers. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2010, compared to $300.3 million, or 28 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2009, an increase of $81.5 million, or 27 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of our efforts to expand internationally. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated in Europe and Asia Pacific to continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenues world wide. Cost of Revenues.

The increase in absolute dollars was due to an increase of $25.2 million in employee related costs, an increase of $3.3 million in stock based expenses, and an increase of $3.5 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 24 percent between January 31, 2009 and January 31, 2010 in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 41 percent for fiscal 2010 compared to 44 percent for fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S. statutory tax rate as well as increased tax credits. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock based compensation was $32.1 million for fiscal 2010. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2011, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion and accounts receivable of $426.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $459.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $270.9 million during the same period a year ago. The improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the growth in our customer base, increases in the contract values of our subscription service contracts, improving renewal rates and the associated increase in billings and collections. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income; sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, the timing of commission and bonus payments, and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers; add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion during fiscal 2011 and $378.6 million during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2011 primarily related to the purchase of Jigsaw, Heroku, DimDim, the purchase of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California, investment of cash balances, and capital expenditures and strategic investments in public and private companies. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we purchased approximately 14 acres of undeveloped land in San Francisco, California, including entitlements and improvements associated with the land, and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage for approximately $278.0 million in cash. We plan to use the land to build our new global headquarters and therefore will devote additional financial resources in the future to build our new headquarters. 48 Table of Contents Net cash provided by financing activities was $14.1 million during fiscal 2011 and $637.2 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2011 consisted primarily of $160.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and $36.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, offset by the $172.0 million in purchases of Salesforce Japan shares held by others and $10.4 million of principal payments on capital leases. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the Warrants). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. As of January 31, 2011, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the Note Hedges or delivered cash or shares under the Warrants. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, for the quarter ending April 30, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, government obligations and municipal securities. As of January 31, 2011, we have a total of $8.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through September 2021. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2011, the future non cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5 Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 18,637 $ 10,830 $ 7,807 $ 0 $ 0 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 436,944 75,166 150,438 91,549 119,791 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 62,340 32,177 30,163 0 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 592,251 4,313 8,625 579,313 0 Contractual commitments 1,603 3 1,600 0 0 As of February 1, 2011 the Notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder.

Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to 49 Table of Contents the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. This potential repayment of the Notes is not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above. We have a contractual obligation to begin construction on the undeveloped land by September 2014. If we do not commence construction by this date we will be subject to certain penalties due to a third party. These potential penalties are not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above. We do not believe we will be subject to these penalties. Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. The timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. During fiscal 2012, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services or technologies. While we believe we have sufficient financial resources to do so, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Recent Accounting Pronouncement In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Update No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009 13). It updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under ASC 605 25. The revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes: 1) eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting, and 2) requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition. ASU 2009 13 will be effective for us at the start of fiscal 2012. We believe the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement will not be material to our consolidated net income. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar, Japanese Yen and Australian dollar. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at January 31, 2011. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2011 could result in a $27.7 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.7 billion. The fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $13.1 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the Notes). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. As of February 1, 2011 the Notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2011. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal 51 Table of Contents amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. Therefore, as of February 1, 2011, the Notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $472.5 million as of January 31, 2011. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2011. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2011 was $946.1 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which was $164.55. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for the minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. At January 31, 2011, the fair value of these investments was $27.1 million. 52 Table of Contents
