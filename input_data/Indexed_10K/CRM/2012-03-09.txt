ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward looking statements, including, without limitation, our expectations and statements regarding our outlook and future revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, plans, strategies and objectives of management and any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements. Factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled of this Annual Report on Form 10 K Risk Factors. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. Overview We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing and social enterprise solutions, and are dedicated to helping customers transform themselves into social enterprises. Social enterprises leverage social, mobile and open technologies to place their customers and employees at the center of their business and to engage and collaborate with them in new and powerful ways. Our technologies are targeted at businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. We were founded in February 1999 and began offering our enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) application service in February 2000. Since then, we have augmented our CRM service with new editions, services and enhanced features. Over the last few years, we have both developed and acquired several mobile, social and open technologies to help our customers become social enterprises. We introduced our Force.com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond CRM. We launched our AppExchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications and services that are integrated with our flagship CRM product and in most cases have been developed on our Force.com platform by third parties. We introduced Chatter, a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real time. Recently we enabled companies to invite their customers to collaborate with Chatter in private groups on this corporate social network. Our Salesforce Data.com (Data.com) offering, which provides some contacts from Jigsaw Data Corporation (Jigsaw), provides the most complete source of accurate business data and seamlessly integrates with our CRM products. We also expanded our platform offering via the acquisition of Heroku, Inc. (Heroku) an application development platform and the launch of Database.com, the worlds first enterprise cloud database. We acquired Radian6 Technologies, Inc. (Radian6) to help companies monitor and engage with their customers via social media. Our objective is to help companies put customers at the center of their businesses and transform themselves into social enterprises by leveraging our applications and platforms. Key elements of our strategy include: Strengthening our existing sales and service cloud applications and extending into new functional areas within the social enterprise; Leading the industry transformation to the social enterprise; Pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively; Deepening relationships with our existing customer base; Encouraging the development of third party applications on our cloud computing platforms. We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the performance and security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence of 33 Table of Contents additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the location of new data centers; third party developers willingness to develop applications on our platforms; and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates. To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our Unlimited Edition or arrangements such as a social enterprise license agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third party applications on our platforms. Our plans to invest for future growth include the continuation of the expansion of our data center capacity. We also plan to continue to hire additional personnel, particularly in direct sales, other customer related areas and research and development. As part of our growth plans, we intend to continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Additionally, we plan to: expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities; continue to develop our brands; add additional distribution channels; increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings; develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies; and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth. We also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our service offerings. We expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. As such, we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal 2013 to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. During fiscal 2012, we acquired several businesses and technologies to strengthen and extend our service offerings. In May 2011, we acquired Radian6 for a total purchase consideration of approximately $336.6 million, net of cash acquired. Radian6 is a cloud application vendor that provides customers with social media monitoring, measurement and engagement solutions. We acquired Radian6 for its developed technology, assembled workforce, expected synergies and expanded market opportunities when integrating Radian6s social solution technology with our current product offerings. In September 2011, we acquired Assistly for a total purchase consideration of approximately $58.7 million. Assistly is a cloud based provider of customer service solutions. We acquired Assistly for its developed help desk application technology in order to expand our customer service market opportunities in the small and emerging business market. In order to expand our mobile and social consulting services, in December 2011, we acquired Model Metrics, a cloud computing professional services company, for a total purchase consideration of approximately $66.7 million. We expect marketing and sales costs, which were 52 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2012 and 48 percent for the same period a year ago, to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers, and build greater brand awareness. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2012, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2012. 34 Table of Contents Sources of Revenues We derive our revenues from: (1) subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services; (2) support revenues from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees; (3) professional services, which include consulting services such as process mapping and project management, and implementation services including systems integration, technical architecture and development, and data conversion; and (4) other revenue, which consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues during fiscal 2012. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, the price of our service and service renewal rates. We define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services. We define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer authorized users, and we refer to each such user as a subscriber. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues during fiscal 2012, 2011, or 2010. Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. The typical subscription and support term is 12 to 24 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our subscription and support contracts are non cancelable, though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual or quarterly installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue, or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. In determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues, we consider a number of factors, which are described in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition below. Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a related professional service arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue was recognized. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009 13) which amended the previous multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the new guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this new accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year. 35 Table of Contents Seasonal Nature of Deferred Revenue and Accounts Receivable Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles. There is a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Currently, there is greater operational discipline around annual invoicing, for both new business and renewals. Occasionally, we bill customers for their multi year contract on a single invoice which results in an increase in noncurrent deferred revenue. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter as displayed below: (in thousands) April 30,2011 July 31,2011 October 31,2011 January 31,2012 Fiscal 2012 Accounts receivable, net $ 270,816 $ 342,397 $ 312,331 $ 683,745 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 915,133 935,266 917,821 1,380,295 (in thousands) April 30,2010 July 31,2010 October 31,2010 January 31,2011 Fiscal 2011 Accounts receivable, net $ 183,612 $ 228,550 $ 258,764 $ 426,943 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 664,529 683,019 694,557 934,941 (in thousands) April 30,2009 July 31,2009 October 31,2009 January 31,2010 Fiscal 2010 Accounts receivable, net $ 145,869 $ 168,842 $ 191,297 $ 320,956 Deferred revenue, current and noncurrent 549,373 549,010 545,435 704,348 Unbilled Deferred Revenue The deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year, non cancelable subscription agreements. Unbilled deferred revenue was over $2.2 billion as of January 31, 2012 and over $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2011. Unbilled deferred revenue represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in deferred revenue. We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons, including the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewals, foreign currency fluctuations, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is to be recognized as revenue, and changes in customer financial circumstances. For multi year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled deferred revenue is typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increases if the agreement is renewed. Low unbilled deferred revenue attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal and may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Accordingly, we expect that the amount of aggregate unbilled deferred revenue will change from year to year depending in part upon the number and dollar amount of subscription agreements at particular stages in their renewal cycle. Such fluctuations are not a reliable indicator of future revenues. 36 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues and Operating Expenses Cost of Revenues. Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support, the costs of data center capacity, depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our services and acquired developed technologies. We allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount. Employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services, including stock based expenses, the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services. For example, we plan to open additional data centers and expand our current data centers in the future. Additionally, as we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues. The timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues, in the affected periods. Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services, integrating acquired technologies, increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing services. Our proprietary, scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application. As a result, we do not have to maintain multiple versions, which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies. We expect that in the future, research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we improve and extend our service offerings, develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies. Marketing and Sales. Marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners, marketing programs and allocated overhead. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building and product marketing activities. We plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities, building brand awareness, attracting new customers and sponsoring additional marketing events. We expect that in the future, marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses, including stock based expenses, for finance and accounting, legal, internal audit, human resources and management information systems personnel, legal costs, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We expect that in the future, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs, professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion. We expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters. Stock Based Expenses. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to equity plans for employees and non employee directors. We recognize our stock based compensation as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods. These charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as our stock price increases, as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees. 37 Table of Contents Amortization of Purchased Intangibles from business combinations. Our cost of revenues and operating expenses include amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships. We expect this expense to increase as we acquire more companies. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition. We derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee; and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. Other revenue consists primarily of training fees. We commence revenue recognition when all of the following conditions are satisfied: There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; The service has been or is being provided to the customer; The collection of the fees is reasonably assured; and The amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Our subscription service arrangements are non cancelable and do not contain refund type provisions. Subscription and Support Revenues Subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract, which is the date our service is made available to customers. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Professional Services and Other Revenues The majority of our professional services contracts are on a time and material basis. When these services are not combined with subscription revenues as a single unit of accounting, as discussed below, these revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts, and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts. Training revenues are recognized after the services are performed. Multiple Deliverable Arrangements We enter into arrangements with multiple deliverables that generally include subscription, premium support, and professional services. 38 Table of Contents Prior to February 1, 2011, the deliverables in multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for separately if the delivered items had standalone value and there was objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items. If the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement could not be accounted for separately, the total arrangement fee was recognized ratably as a single unit of accounting over the contracted term of the subscription agreement. A significant portion of our multiple deliverable arrangements were accounted for as a single unit of accounting because we did not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for certain of our deliverables. Additionally, in these situations, we deferred the direct costs of a professional services arrangement and amortized those costs over the same period as the professional services revenue is recognized. In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009 13) which amended the previous multiple deliverable arrangements accounting guidance. Pursuant to the updated guidance, objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the deliverables to be delivered is no longer required in order to account for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement separately. Instead, arrangement consideration is allocated to deliverables based on their relative selling price. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we adopted this updated accounting guidance on a prospective basis. We have applied the new accounting guidance to those multiple deliverable arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after February 1, 2011 which is the beginning of our fiscal year. The adoption of this updated accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 31, 2012, the deferred professional services revenue and deferred costs under the previous accounting guidance are $30.5 million and $14.3 million, respectively, which will continue to be recognized over the related remaining subscription period. Under the updated accounting guidance, in order to treat deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Subscription services have standalone value as such services are often sold separately. In determining whether professional services have standalone value, we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement: availability of the services from other vendors, the nature of the professional services, the timing of when the professional services contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date, and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customers satisfaction with the professional services work. To date, we have concluded that all of the professional services included in multiple deliverable arrangements executed have standalone value. Under the updated accounting guidance, when multiple deliverables included in an arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on its vendor specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE), if available, or our best estimate of selling price (BESP), if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third party evidence (TPE) is not a practical alternative due to differences in our service offerings compared to other parties and the availability of relevant third party pricing information. The amount of revenue allocated to delivered items is limited by contingent revenue, if any. For certain professional services, we have established VSOE as a consistent number of standalone sales of this deliverable have been priced within a reasonably narrow range. We have not established VSOE for our subscription services due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new services and other factors. Accordingly, we use our BESP to determine the relative selling price. We determined BESP by considering our overall pricing objectives and market conditions. Significant pricing practices taken into consideration include our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where our services are sold, our price lists, our 39 Table of Contents go to market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices. The determination of BESP is made through consultation with and approval by management, taking into consideration the go to market strategy. As our go to market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which could result in changes in relative selling prices, including both VSOE and BESP. Deferred Revenue. The deferred revenue balance does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi year, non cancelable subscription agreements. Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription service described above and is recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met. We generally invoice customers in annual or quarterly installments. Deferred revenue is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, invoice timing and new business linearity within the quarter. As a result of the updated accounting guidance previously described, billings against professional services arrangements entered into prior to February 1, 2011 were generally added to deferred revenue and recognized over the remaining related subscription contract term. Deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve month period is recorded as current deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as noncurrent. Deferred Commissions. We defer commission payments to our direct sales force. The commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers, which are typically 12 to 24 months. The commission payments, which are paid in full the month after the customers service commences, are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements. The deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts. We believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. During fiscal 2012, we deferred $167.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $107.2 million to sales expense. During the same period a year ago, we deferred $121.2 million of commission expenditures and we amortized $80.2 million to sales expense. Deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $176.6 million at January 31, 2012 and $116.6 million at January 31, 2011. Business Combinations. We recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. We reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. 40 Table of Contents Stock Based Awards. We recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of generally four years or one year for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The estimated life for the stock options is based on an actual analysis of expected life. The estimated life for the ESPP is based on the two purchase periods within the offering period. The risk free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. government security with the same estimated life at the time of the option grant and the stock purchase rights. We estimate the future stock price volatility considering both our observed option implied volatilities and our historical volatility calculations. We believe this is the best estimate of the expected volatility over the expected life of our stock options and stock purchase rights. We recognized stock based expense of $229.3 million during fiscal 2012. The requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations. As of January 31, 2012, we had an aggregate of $820.6 million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards. We currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows: $296.5 million during fiscal 2013; $256.4 million during fiscal 2014; $196.1 million during fiscal 2015 and $71.6 million during fiscal 2016. These amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of January 31, 2012 and assume no forfeiture activity. We expect to continue to issue stock based awards to our employees in future periods, which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods. We recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs, as applicable by jurisdiction, when stock options are exercised. The impact of stock based expense in the future is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of when we hire additional employees, the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees, the total number of stock awards granted, the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant, changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates. Additionally, we are required to use an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards. This determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards. As of January 31, 2012, there were 5.0 million restricted stock awards and units outstanding. We plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future. The restricted stock, which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock, has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, which is equal to the par value of our common stock, and vests over four years. The fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant, and compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The tax expense or benefit for unusual items, or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions, compensation, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and accounting principles. Our tax positions are subject to income tax audits by multiple tax jurisdictions throughout the world. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is 41 Table of Contents measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision. Strategic Investments. We report our investments in marketable equity securities at fair market value using the quoted prices in their respective active markets. We report our investments in non marketable equity and debt securities, which consist of minority equity and debt investments in privately held companies, at cost or fair value when an event or circumstance indicates an other than temporary decline in value has occurred.

Subscription and support revenues were $2.1 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $1.6 billion, or 94 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago. The increase in subscription and support revenues was due primarily to new customers, upgrades and additional subscriptions from existing customers and improved renewal rates as compared to a year ago. The price per user per month for our three primary offerings, Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition and Unlimited Edition, in fiscal 2012 has generally remained consistent relative to fiscal 2011. Professional services and other revenues were $140.3 million, or six percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $106.0 million, or six percent of total revenues, for the same period a year ago. The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements. Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $726.3 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2012, compared to $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $204.1 million, or 39 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, our focus on marketing our services internationally and improved renewal rates. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies contributed to a slight increase in U.S. dollar revenues outside of the Americas for fiscal 2012 as compared to the same period a year ago. The foreign currency impact had the effect of increasing our aggregate revenues by $36.9 million compared to the same period a year ago. As part of our overall growth, we expect the percentage of our revenue generated outside of the Americas to increase as a percentage of our total revenues worldwide. Cost of Revenues. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Subscription and support $ 360,758 $ 208,243 $ 152,515 Professional services and other 128,128 115,570 12,558 Total cost of revenues $ 488,886 $ 323,813 $ 165,073 Percent of total revenues 22 % 20 % Cost of revenues was $488.9 million, or 22 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $323.8 million, or 20 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $165.1 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $20.4 million in employee related costs, an increase of $5.3 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $39.8 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data center capacity, an increase of $68.3 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $44.6 million of which related to the amortization of purchased intangible assets, an increase of $24.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, and an increase of $5.5 million in allocated overhead. Gross profit margins for professional services and other revenues improved over the same period a year ago primarily due to the improved utilization of existing headcount and a benefit from the prospective adoption of the new revenue accounting guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements. 45 Table of Contents We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing services and data center capacity. Additionally, the amortization of purchased intangible assets will increase as we acquire additional businesses and technologies. We also plan to add additional employees in our professional services group to facilitate the adoption of our services. The timing of these expenses will affect our cost of revenues, both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in future periods. Research and Development. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Research and development $ 295,347 $ 187,887 $ 107,460 Percent of total revenues 13 % 11 % Research and development expenses were $295.3 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $187.9 million, or 11 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $107.5 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $66.7 million in employee related costs, an increase of $27.0 million in stock based expenses, an increase of $2.2 million in our development and test data center, an increase of $1.4 million in depreciation and amortization expenses and an increase of $8.6 million in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development headcount by 52 percent since January 31, 2011 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. Marketing and Sales. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Marketing and sales $ 1,169,610 $ 792,029 $ 377,581 Percent of total revenues 52 % 48 % Marketing and sales expenses were $1,169.6 million, or 52 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $792.0 million, or 48 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $377.6 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $255.6 million in employee related costs, $59.3 million in stock based expenses, $22.5 million in advertising, marketing and event costs, $21.8 million in allocated overhead, $8.2 million in outside subcontractor and other service costs, $3.1 million in depreciation and amortization and the preliminary settlement of the California wage and hour case discussed in Note 8. Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 44 percent since January 31, 2011 as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base. Some of the increase in headcount was due to acquired businesses. General and Administrative. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 General and administrative $ 347,781 $ 255,913 $ 91,868 Percent of total revenues 15 % 15 % General and administrative expenses were $347.8 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2012, compared to $255.9 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $91.9 million. The increase was primarily due to increases of $57.5 million in employee related costs, $17.3 million in stock based expenses and $14.3 million in professional and outside service costs. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 46 percent since January 31, 2011 as we added personnel to support our growth. 46 Table of Contents Income (loss) from operations. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Income (loss) from operations $ (35,085 ) $ 97,497 $ (132,582 ) Percent of total revenues (2 )% 6 % Loss from operations during fiscal 2012 was $35.1 million and included $229.3 million of stock based expenses and $67.3 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. During the same period a year ago, operating income was $97.5 million and included $120.4 million of stock based expenses and $19.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles. Investment income. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Investment income $ 23,268 $ 37,735 $ (14,467 ) Percent of total revenues 1 % 2 % Investment income consists of income on cash and marketable securities balances. Investment income was $23.3 million during fiscal 2012 and was $37.7 million during the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in realized gains from sales of marketable securities, the decrease in marketable securities balances and lower interest rates. Interest expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Interest expense $ (17,045 ) $ (24,909 ) $ 7,864 Percent of total revenues (1 )% (2 )% Interest expense consists of interest on our convertible senior notes and capital leases. Interest expense was $17.0 million, net of interest costs capitalized, during fiscal 2012 and was $24.9 million during the same period a year ago. During fiscal 2012, we capitalized $14.6 million of interest costs related to capital projects, specifically costs related to our real estate holdings, which began during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, and our capitalized internal use software development costs. Capitalized interest during the same period a year ago was $4.0 million. Other expense. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Other expense $ (4,455 ) $ (6,025 ) $ 1,570 Other expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses resulting from strategic investment activity and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other expense decreased primarily due to the net gain of $2.9 million from activity within our portfolio of noncontrolling equity and debt investments in privately held companies offset by realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions for fiscal 2012 compared to the same period a year ago. 47 Table of Contents Benefit (provision) for income taxes. Fiscal Year Ended January 31, VarianceDollars (In thousands) 2012 2011 Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 21,745 $ (34,601 ) $ 56,346 Effective tax rate 65 % 33 % The benefit for income taxes was $21.7 million during fiscal 2012, compared to an income tax provision of $34.6 million during the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate was 65 percent for fiscal 2012 compared to 33 percent for the same period a year ago. The higher tax rate was primarily attributable to an increase in federal and California tax credits and a tax benefit related to the May 2011 acquisition of Radian6. The combined effect of these tax benefits was partially offset by an increase in foreign tax rate differential. Foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2012 pre tax loss was higher as compared to foreign tax expense relative to our fiscal 2011 pre tax income. The combined effect of these items on a small net loss before income taxes resulted in a comparatively higher fiscal 2012 effective tax rate. The lower fiscal 2012 state tax rate was primarily attributable to two items. First, California enacted several income tax law changes, which generally benefited California based companies. The result of this tax law change substantially reduced our state effective tax rate. Second, the company was subject to minimum state taxes, which reduced the state tax benefit. The combined effect of these tax items was an overall small fiscal 2012 state tax benefit. Note that we separately recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million in fiscal 2011 to re value the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences related to this tax law change. We also receive certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. These temporary tax reduction programs will expire in 2016 and 2014 respectively. The Singapore program is eligible for renewal. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock based compensation was $76.0 million for fiscal 2012.

The increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of customers. 48 Table of Contents Revenues in Europe and Asia Pacific accounted for $522.1 million, or 32 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2011, compared to $381.8 million, or 29 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2010, an increase of $140.3 million, or 37 percent. The increase in revenues outside of the Americas was the result of the increasing acceptance of our service, and our focus on marketing our service internationally.

Our effective tax rate decreased to 33 percent for fiscal 2011 compared to 41 percent for fiscal 2010. The decrease was due to a higher proportion of income being generated in countries with lower income tax rates than the U.S statutory tax rate, as well as increased tax credits. The extension of the federal research credit provision was enacted in the Tax Relief Act of 2010. The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to stock based compensation was $44.1 million for fiscal 2011. See Note 6 Income Taxes to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal rate to the provision for income taxes. In addition, in February 2009, the State of California enacted several income tax law changes which included an election to apply a single sales factor apportionment formula and adoption of a market sourcing approach for service income impacted us beginning in fiscal 2012. As a result, we re valued the anticipated future tax effects of our California temporary differences including stock based compensation and purchased intangibles. Accordingly, we recorded an income tax expense of $2.2 million and $2.7 million related to this tax law change during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010 29, Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations (Topic 805) Business Combinations (ASU 2010 29), to improve consistency in how the pro forma disclosures are calculated. Additionally, ASU 2010 29 enhances the disclosure requirements and requires description of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to a business combination. ASU 2010 29 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 and should be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the effective date. We do not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2010 29 will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011 05), to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011 05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011 05 is effective for us in fiscal 2013 and should be applied retrospectively. We do not believe the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2011 05 will have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources At January 31, 2012, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion and accounts receivable of $683.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was $591.5 million during fiscal 2012 and $459.1 million during the same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by: the amount of net income (loss); sales of subscriptions, support and professional services; changes in working capital accounts, particularly increases and seasonality in accounts receivable and deferred revenue as described above, the timing of commission and bonus payments, and the timing of collections from large enterprise customers; add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount and the expense associated with stock based awards. Net cash used in investing activities was $489.7 million during fiscal 2012 and $1.1 billion during the same period a year ago. The net cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2012 primarily related to the purchase of Model Metrics in December 2011, the purchase of Assistly in September 2011, the purchase of Radian6 in May 2011, the purchase of Manymoon in February 2011, investment of cash balances, capital expenditures and strategic investments offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $75.9 million during fiscal 2012 and $14.1 million during the same period a year ago. Net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2012 consisted primarily of $116.6 million of proceeds from equity plans and $6.0 million of excess tax benefits from employee stock plans, offset by $30.5 million of principal payments on capital leases and $16.2 million of contingent consideration payments. In January 2010, we issued $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2015 (the Notes) and concurrently entered into convertible notes hedges (the Note Hedges) and separate warrant transactions (the Warrants). The Notes will mature on January 15, 2015, unless earlier converted. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended October 31, 2011, our common stock traded at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes were convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending January 31, 2012. The Notes are classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are convertible. Upon conversion of any Notes, we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the Notes and, with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the Notes, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of both. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, our common stock did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. treasury securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds, government obligations and municipal securities. 52 Table of Contents As of January 31, 2012, we have a total of $17.5 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and mature at various dates through April 2030. We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment, we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements. Additionally, we currently do not have a bank line of credit. Our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for data center capacity and our development and test data center, and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures. At January 31, 2012, the future non cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows: (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 60,997 $ 27,585 $ 30,125 $ 3,287 $ 0 Operating lease obligations: Facilities space 607,738 91,625 148,080 117,718 250,315 Computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 60,082 32,622 27,460 0 0 Convertible Senior Notes, including interest 587,938 4,313 583,625 0 0 Contractual commitments 200 100 100 0 0 Our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations. Purchase orders are not included in the table above. Our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. In January 2012, we entered into an office lease agreement to lease approximately 400,000 rentable square feet at 50 Fremont Street, San Francisco, CA. The cost of the lease is approximately $209.0 million over the 18 year term of the lease. We will take possession of the premises in phases beginning April 1, 2012. Our commitment is included in the table above. On June 7, 2011, we entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with respect to a California state wage and hour lawsuit that had been filed against us early in 2011 in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco. The settlement agreement is subject to approval of the court, which is expected to rule by mid 2012. Our current estimate of the expense charge for the settlement is approximately $0.04 per diluted share. This charge is reflected in our financial results for fiscal 2012. We anticipate making a tax payment of approximately $40.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 as a result of the Radian6 transaction. Besides the aforementioned Radian6 tax payment, the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements. For further information, see Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next 12 months. 53 Table of Contents During fiscal 2013, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or joint ventures, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. Non GAAP Financial Measures Regulation S K Item 10(e), Use of Non GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings, defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non GAAP financial information. Our measures of non GAAP gross profit, non GAAP operating profit, non GAAP net income and non GAAP earnings per share each meet the definition of a non GAAP financial measure. Non GAAP gross profit, Non GAAP operating profit and Non GAAP net income We use the non GAAP measures of non GAAP gross profit, non GAAP operating profit and non GAAP net income to provide an additional view of operational performance by excluding non cash expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period. We use these non GAAP measures when planning, monitoring, and evaluating our performance. We believe that these non GAAP measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business, as they exclude certain expenses. These certain expenses are excluded because the decisions which gave rise to these expenses are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but are made for our long term benefit over multiple periods and we are not able to change or affect these items in any particular period. We define non GAAP net income as our total net income excluding the following components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses. In each case, for the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the component provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the impact of certain non cash items to our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as us, in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the impact of these non cash items on our gross margin and operating performance. Stock Based Expenses. The companys compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. The company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired companys research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While it is continually viewed for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Amortization of Debt Discount. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the companys $575 million of convertible subordinated notes that were issued in a private placement in January 2010. The imputed interest rate is approximately 5.9%, while the coupon interest rate is 0.75%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense, net of the interest amount capitalized, is excluded from managements assessment of the companys operating performance because management believes that this non cash expense is not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management believes that the exclusion of the non cash interest expense provides investors an enhanced view of the companys operational performance. 54 Table of Contents Income Tax Effects. The companys non GAAP effective tax rate excludes the tax effect of the expense items described above. We define non GAAP gross profit as our total revenues less cost of revenues, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles, as described above, that are included in cost of revenues. We define non GAAP operating profit as our gross profit less operating expenses, as reported on our consolidated statement of operations, excluding the portions of stock based expenses and amortization of purchased intangibles, as described above, that are included in operating expenses. Non GAAP earnings per share Management uses the non GAAP earnings per share to provide an additional view of performance by excluding expenses that are not directly related to performance in any particular period in the earnings per share calculation. We define non GAAP earnings per share as our non GAAP net income, which excludes the above components, which we believe are not reflective of our ongoing operational expenses, divided by basic or diluted shares outstanding. Limitations on the use of Non GAAP financial measures A limitation of our non GAAP financial measures of non GAAP gross profit, non GAAP operating profit, non GAAP net income and non GAAP earnings per share is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non GAAP measures of non GAAP gross profit, non GAAP operating profit, non GAAP net income and non GAAP earnings per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock based expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling non GAAP gross profit, non GAAP operating profit, non GAAP net income and non GAAP earnings per share to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Management encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Foreign currency exchange risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Japanese Yen. We seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts. Any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures. In accordance with our policy, the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months. Additionally, by policy, we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate sensitivity We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion at January 31, 2012. This amount was invested primarily in money market funds, time deposits, corporate notes and bonds, government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single A or better. The cash, cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our investments are made for capital preservation purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However because we classify our debt securities as available for sale, no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary. Our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk. An immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points at January 31, 2012 could result in a $12.1 million market value reduction or increase of the same amount. This estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur. Fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates (gains or losses on the carrying value) are recorded in other comprehensive income, and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities. At January 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.4 billion. The fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates of 100 basis points would have resulted in market value changes of $27.7 million. Market Risk and Market Interest Risk In January 2010, we issued at par value $575.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2015 (the Notes). Holders may convert their Notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. Upon conversion, we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the Notes. Amounts in excess of the principal amount, if any, may be paid in cash or stock at our option. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants. These separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the Notes. For the three months ended January 31, 2012 the Notes were convertible at the option of the noteholder. For 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended January 31, 2012, our common stock traded did not exceed 130% of the conversion price of $85.36 per share applicable to the Notes. Accordingly, the Notes will not be convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending April 30, 2012 and will be reclassified as a noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the Notes are not convertible. 57 Table of Contents The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.75% and therefore, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the value of the Notes are exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair value of our Notes is affected by our stock price. The carrying value of our Notes was $496.1 million as of January 31, 2012. This represents the liability component of the $575.0 million principal balance as of January 31, 2012. The total estimated fair value of our Notes at January 31, 2012 was $869.5 million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per $100 of the Notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which was $151.25. We have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies, many of which are in the development stage. When our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence, we account for investments in non marketable equity and debt securities of the privately held companies using the cost method of accounting. Otherwise, we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting. As of January 31, 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these investments was $48.3 million and $21.1 million, respectively. 58 Table of Contents
