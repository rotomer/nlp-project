Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Revenues Revenues for the Global Commercial and U.S. Federal Sector segments (see note 11) for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount U. S. Commercial $ 4,340.2 5 % $ 4,124.4 13 % $ 3,636.8 Europe 2,946.4 14 2,593.0 3 2,526.0 Other International 1,264.3 4 1,216.2 35 902.8 Global Commercial 8,550.9 8 7,933.6 12 7,065.6 U. S. Federal Sector 2,874.9 11 2,590.3 13 2,301.9 Corporate .2 .1 3.2 Total $ 11,426.0 9 $ 10,524.0 12 $ 9,370.7 The Companys 9% overall revenue growth for fiscal 2002 over 2001 resulted principally from the successful expansion of its broad range of end to end I/T services across its geographic span and its global commercial and U.S. federal segments. The Company announced $11.4 billion in new business awards during fiscal 2002 compared with $10.9 billion and $11.3 billion announced for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000, respectively. Global commercial revenue grew 8%, or $617.3 million, during fiscal 2002. In constant currency, global commercial revenue grew approximately 10%. The Company announced $3.6 billion in new global commercial business awards during fiscal 2002 compared with the $8.2 billion announced during fiscal 2001 and $6.9 billion announced during fiscal 2000. For fiscal 2002, U.S. commercial revenue grew 5%, or $215.8 million. This growth was principally generated by outsourcing engagements including additional activities on the Nortel Networks, BAE Systems, General Dynamics and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. contracts and further expansion in the Companys financial services vertical markets including the benefit associated with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Mynd Corporation ("Mynd"). Revenue growth was impacted by a significant decrease in consulting and systems integration revenue. For fiscal 2001, U.S. commercial revenue grew 13%, or $487.6 million. This growth was principally generated by a significant increase in outsourcing revenue, fueled by major new contracts including AT&T and Nortel Networks, as well as increased revenue due to the Mynd acquisition. Increased revenues in these areas were offset by a decline in consulting and systems integration revenue due to the deterioration in demand for these services. The Companys European operations generated fiscal 2002 growth of 14%, or $353.4 million. In constant currency, European revenue growth was approximately 17%. The growth was mainly attributable to outsourcing services in the United Kingdom including additional activities associated with automotive services, AMP Limited, BAE Systems and Schroders Bank. For fiscal 2001 compared to 2000, the Companys European operations generated revenue growth of 3%, or $67 million. In constant currency, European revenue growth was approximately 14%. The growth was principally due to outsourcing engagements, particularly in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. European revenue growth was also affected by a decline in consulting and systems integration revenue for fiscal 2002 and 2001. Other international operations provided revenue growth of 4%, or $48.1 million, during fiscal 2002. In constant currency, other international growth was approximately 10%. The growth was primarily attributable to expansion from outsourcing contracts including activities associated with Nortel Networks 10 and a new outsourcing contract with the Northern Territory Government in Australia. Other international revenue growth was impacted by reduced demand for services in Asia due to weakness in the Asian economies. For fiscal 2001, other international revenue grew 35%, or $313.4 million. The growth was primarily attributable to the outsourcing agreement with The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and acquisition of its I/T subsidiary and benefit associated with the fiscal 2000 acquisition of GE Capital Information Technology Solutions in Australia. The Companys U.S. federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources: Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount Department of Defense $ 1,770.6 10 % $ 1,610.7 10 % $ 1,464.7 Civil agencies 1,019.7 14 898.0 23 732.7 Other 84.6 4 81.6 (22 ) 104.5 Total U. S. Federal $ 2,874.9 11 $ 2,590.3 13 $ 2,301.9 Revenues from the U.S. federal sector increased 11% during fiscal 2002 versus 2001. The increase was principally related to new and increased work related to intelligence community activities, the Army Logistics Modernization contract ("LOGMOD"), the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Prime contract and several other task order activities on both Civil agency and Department of Defense ("DoD") contracts. Revenue for fiscal 2001 compared to 2000 increased 13%. The increase was principally related to activity with the IRS contract, the LOGMOD contract, other task order contracts and add on business from existing awards on various Civil agency and DoD contracts. During fiscal 2002, CSC announced federal contract awards with a total value of $7.8 billion, compared with the $2.7 billion and $4.4 billion announced during fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses before special items were as follows: Dollar Amount Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Costs of services $ 9,222.8 $ 8,425.1 $ 7,352.5 80.7 % 80.0 % 78.5 % Selling, general and administrative 706.3 796.6 779.4 6.2 7.6 8.3 Depreciation and amortization 857.6 649.3 545.7 7.5 6.2 5.8 Interest expense, net 142.5 89.8 40.5 1.3 .8 .4 Total $ 10,929.2 $ 9,960.8 $ 8,718.1 95.7 % 94.6 % 93.0 % Costs of Services For fiscal 2002, the Companys costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.7% from 80.0%. The change was primarily related to a decrease in demand for commercial consulting and systems integration services, which decreased utilization and impacted revenue realization. The Company also experienced cost pressure on certain outsourcing contracts and an increase in the provision for losses on accounts receivable. The majority of the increase in the provision related to customer credit risks associated with certain companies for which the Company provided systems integration and consulting/professional services. For fiscal 2001, the Companys costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.0% from 78.5%. The change was driven principally by the deteriorating demand in the fourth quarter for global 11 commercial consulting and systems integration services adversely impacting billing rates and utilization, particularly in North America and Europe. Higher labor costs experienced throughout the year within the U.S. and Australian consulting operations and severance costs for reductions in force also contributed to the increased cost of services. In addition, some cost pressure on two relatively new outsourcing contracts, adjustments on a few fixed price projects and an increase in the provision for losses on accounts receivable due to increased credit risk associated with certain receivables primarily associated with certain companies for which the Company provided systems integration and consulting/professional services. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 6.2% from 7.6% for fiscal 2002 versus 2001. The decrease was due to the Companys continued cost reduction initiatives, managements focus on discretionary costs and consolidation of certain back office services. During the year, the Company realigned certain functions in its U.S. healthcare operations with similar functions in other groups and integrated its Pinnacle Alliance unit into the financial services vertical operations. For fiscal 2001, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 7.6% from 8.3%. The decrease was due to managements tight focus regarding discretionary costs due to the increased costs of services noted above. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 7.5% from 6.2% for fiscal 2002 versus 2001. The increase was due primarily to the additional depreciation and amortization of assets associated with the Companys increased outsourcing activities, now accounting for over 50% of total revenue, and increased goodwill amortization related to the December 2000 acquisition of Mynd. For fiscal 2001, depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 6.2% from 5.8%. The increase was principally due to the capital intensive nature of the Companys growing outsourcing business. Interest Expense Interest expense, net of interest income, increased as a percentage of revenue to 1.3% for fiscal 2002 from .8% for 2001. The increase was principally due to higher debt levels for the first three quarters of fiscal 2002 due in part to the December 2000 acquisition of Mynd and to purchase assets related to outsourcing activities, partially offset by benefit from lower interest rates. For fiscal 2001, the Companys net interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to .8% from .4%. The increase relates primarily to the increase in debt incurred to fund the Mynd acquisition, the capital investment to purchase assets due to the increased outsourcing activities, and increased working capital needs. Special Items During fiscal 2002, the Company reviewed its estimates related to the fiscal 2001 special charge and made certain adjustments. These adjustments resulted in increasing the facilities consolidation provision by $4 million. This adjustment was offset by a decrease of $3 million related to the phased out operations and other assets provisions and by a decrease of $1 million related to employee severance costs. The decrease in employee severance costs was due to 109 fewer U.S. employee involuntary terminations. As a result of renegotiations of certain international employee severance agreements, the Company involuntarily terminated an additional 285 international employees. The net impact was an additional 176 employees 12 involuntarily terminated and a $1 million reduction related to employee severance costs. As a result of these actions, there was no net additional special charge recorded during fiscal 2002. Special items of $232.9 ($156.0 after tax) were recorded during fiscal 2001, as detailed below. In response to a changing mix of information technology services, business conditions and overall demand for consulting and systems integration services, the Company reviewed its global operations. As a result of this review, a special item of $137.5 million ($91.3 million after tax) or 54 cents per share (diluted) was recorded during the fourth quarter ended March 30, 2001. Included in the charge was employee severance costs of $67.9 million, write offs in connection with consolidation of facilities of $25.6 million, write off of capitalized software and computer related assets of $22.1 million and $20.9 million related to phased out operations and other assets. The involuntary termination benefits accrued and expensed of $67.9 million related to 1,896 employees of which 722 were U.S. employees and 1,174 were international employees; as of March 29, 2002, approximately $64 million had been paid and 1,876 of the 1,896 employees had been involuntarily terminated. The Company expects to pay substantially all of the remaining cash payments during fiscal 2003. Approximately $9 million of accrued costs related to the consolidation of facilities remains at March 29, 2002 and will be paid through the end of the facility lease terms. In connection with the December 2000 acquisition of Mynd, the Company reviewed its global commercial financial services operations, product strategies and the carrying value of its assets. As a result, special items were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2001. During the third quarter ended December 29, 2000, special items of $84.2 million ($57.3 million after tax), or 34 cents per share (diluted) were recorded and included $58.2 million related to non cash adjustments to the carrying value of capitalized software and the write off of other assets and intangibles and $9.4 million related to a legal settlement and write off of assets from operations previously sold or phased out. The third quarter charge also included $16.6 million accrued for employee severance costs. In the fourth quarter, the amount for employee severance costs was adjusted to $14.5 million. The employee severance costs related to 628 global commercial financial services employees. All of the severance payments have been made and all of the employees have been involuntarily terminated. Upon completion of the integration of Mynd during the fourth quarter ended March 30, 2001, the Company recorded an additional special item of $11.2 million ($7.4 million after tax) or 4 cents per share (diluted) for the write off of capitalized software and a provision for consolidation of facilities. The $11.2 million was the net special item after the severance adjustment described above. Special items of $41.1 million ($29.8 million after tax), or 18 cents per share (diluted), were recorded during fiscal 2000. The Company recorded a special item of $39.1 million ($28.5 million after tax) representing merger related charges and other transaction costs associated with the November 16, 1999 acquisition of Nichols Research Corporation. Also during fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a special item of $2 million ($1.3 million after tax) for legal and other costs, net of recoveries, associated with the final resolution of the remaining issues relating to the Companys fiscal 1998 response to a failed take over attempt. Income Before Taxes The Companys income before taxes and margin for the most recent three fiscal years is as follows: Dollar Amount Margin Dollars in millions 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Before special items $ 496.8 $ 563.2 $ 652.6 4.3 % 5.4 % 7.0 % Income before taxes 496.8 330.3 611.5 4.3 3.1 6.5 Income before special items and taxes decreased during fiscal 2002 as a percentage of revenue. The 1.1 percentage point decrease to 4.3% is directly associated with the increase in costs of services, higher 13 depreciation and amortization and higher net interest expense, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses as explained above. During fiscal 2001, income before special items and taxes decreased as a percentage of revenue. The 1.6 percentage point decrease to 5.4% related to higher costs of services, higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense as detailed above. Taxes The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax earnings was 30.7%, 29.4% and 34.1% for the three years ended March 29, 2002. The tax provision for the special items was 33.0% and 27.3% for fiscal 2001 and 2000 respectively. Before special items, the tax rate was 30.9% and 33.7% for fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. The tax rate of 30.7% was essentially unchanged in fiscal 2002 compared with the fiscal 2001 before special items tax rate of 30.9%. The decrease in the fiscal 2001 tax rate from 33.7% to 30.9% was principally the result of favorable permanent tax benefits which relate to the amortization of intangible assets with a higher tax basis than book basis. Net Income and Earnings per Share The Companys net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000 are as follows: Dollar Amount Margin Dollars in millions, except EPS 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Net income: Before special items $ 344.1 $ 389.2 $ 432.7 3.0 % 3.7 % 4.6 % As reported 344.1 233.2 402.9 3.0 2.2 4.3 Diluted earnings per share: Before special items 2.01 2.28 2.55 As reported 2.01 1.37 2.37 Before special items, the net earnings margin was 3% for fiscal 2002, 3.7% for fiscal 2001 and 4.6% for fiscal 2000. The decline for fiscal 2002 and 2001 was attributable to higher cost of services, depreciation and amortization and interest expense, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses as detailed above. During fiscal 2002, the Companys net income margin increased from 2.2% to 3%. The net income margin improvement is primarily related to the impact of the special items recorded during fiscal 2001, partially offset by increases in other expense categories described above. For fiscal 2001, the Companys net income margin decreased from 4.3% to 2.2%. The decrease is principally related to the special items incurred during fiscal 2001, which reduced net income by $156 million or 1.5% of revenue. 14 Cash Flows Dollars in millions Fisca1 2002 Fiscal 2001 Fiscal 2000 Net cash from operations $ 1,305.4 $ 854.2 $ 946.3 Net cash used in investing (1,205.7 ) (2,243.4 ) (1,176.6 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing (133.9 ) 1,321.5 (111.4 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1.4 ) (8.0 ) (3.7 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents (35.6 ) (75.7 ) (345.4 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 184.7 260.4 617.9 Effect of pooling restatement (12.1 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 149.1 $ 184.7 $ 260.4 Historically, the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents has been provided from operating activities. During fiscal 2002, net cash from operations increased primarily due to higher earnings, an increase in non cash charges (depreciation and amortization) and favorable working capital performance. For fiscal 2001, net cash provided by financing activities exceeded net cash from operations principally as a result of additional borrowings associated with the Mynd acquisition during fiscal 2001 and the result of lower earnings and increased working capital requirements, partially offset by higher non cash charges (depreciation and amortization and special items). The Companys investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software that support the Companys expanding global commercial operations. Investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as subsequent upgrades, expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets. The Companys investments also include several acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting during fiscal 2000 and 2001, most notably the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Mynd. During fiscal 2002, the Company completed its fair market value assessment of initial assets acquired from a major outsourcing client and as a result certain amounts were reclassified from property and equipment to outsourcing contract costs. The reclassification is not expected to have an impact on the Companys future cash flows. As described above, historically a majority of the Companys capital investments have been funded by cash from operations. During fiscal 2002, the Company issued $500 million of 6.75% notes due June 2006 and $500 million of 7.375% notes due June 2011. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the reduction of outstanding commercial paper. Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $149.1 million at March 29, 2002, $184.7 million at March 30, 2001 and $260.4 million at March 31, 2000. During this period, the Companys earnings have added to equity. At the end of fiscal 2002, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 37.8%. Dollars in millions 2002 2001 2000 Debt $ 2,204.1 $ 2,384.0 $ 901.6 Equity 3,623.6 3,215.2 3,044.0 Total capitalization $ 5,827.7 $ 5,599.2 $ 3,945.6 Debt to total capitalization 37.8 % 42.6 % 22.9 % At March 29, 2002, the Companys syndicated credit facilities were comprised of a $316.5 million facility which expires in August 2002 and a $321 million facility which expires in August 2005. At March 29, 2002, approximately $497.8 million was available for borrowing under this program compared to 15 $185 million at the end of fiscal 2001. At March 29, 2002, the Company had no borrowings under these facilities and is in compliance with all terms of the agreements. In addition, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit of $432.8 million available with certain foreign banks. During fiscal 2002, the company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S 3 for up to $1.5 billion of debt and or equity securities. The following table summarizes long term debt, operating leases and minimum purchase obligations: Dollars in millions Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2006 and thereafter Total Long term debt $ 21.4 $ 21.0 $ 15.0 $ 1,837.1 $ 1,894.5 Operating leases, net of sublease income 268.0 186.8 130.3 358.4 943.5 Minimum purchase obligations 169.0 179.6 183.1 102.8 634.5 $ 458.4 $ 387.4 $ 328.4 $ 2,298.3 $ 3,472.5 The Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services that are necessary for the operations of business activities. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over periods ranging from 1 to 5 years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company would have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall. In the normal course of business, the Company may provide certain customers and potential customers with financial performance guarantees, which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which is remote in managements opinion. The Company is in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee, and any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In addition, the Company has other guarantees that represent parent guarantees in support of working capital credit lines established with local financial institutions for its foreign business units. Borrowings under these lines were $39.6 million at March 29, 2002. The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of March 29, 2002: Dollars in millions Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2005 Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 5.0 $ 5.0 Letters of credit 20.5 $ 0.2 20.7 Other surety bonds 11.7 0.4 $ 0.1 12.2 Standby letters of credit 16.1 16.1 Subsidiary debt guarantees 284.7 157.5 40.0 482.2 Total $ 338.0 $ 158.1 $ 40.1 $ 536.2 The Company has a contract with Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), a subsidiary of Enron Corporation, to provide project consulting and business process outsourcing services such as billing, collection, meter reading and customer services. On December 2, 2001, EES filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. During fiscal 2002, the Company provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of $2 million related to EES pre Chapter 11 reorganization project work. In connection with the contract, the Company has purchased property, equipment and software and has 16 incurred outsourcing contract costs. The Company continues to provide certain services under this contract and is being paid currently for these services. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, cash balances, unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Companys sources of debt include the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowings. If the Company were unable to sell commercial paper or if the Company determined it was too costly to do so, the Company has the ability to borrow under the two syndicated backstop credit facilities. Dividends and Redemption It has been the Companys policy to invest earnings in the growth of the Company rather than distribute earnings as dividends. This policy, under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal 1969, is expected to continue, but is subject to regular review by the Board of Directors. Euro Introduction On January 1, 1999 the euro currency was introduced in 11 of the 15 member countries in the European Union. The introduction of the euro was phased in over a period ended January 1, 2002, when notes and coins came into circulation. The replacement of other currencies with the euro did not have and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys overall financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in the Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." The preparation of these consolidated financial statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management periodically evaluates these estimates and assumptions based on available information, experience and trends. Due to the inherent risks and uncertainties involved in using these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Companys critical accounting policies consist of revenue recognition on long term, fixed price contracts and outsourcing contracts, outsourcing contract costs, and contingencies. Revenue recognition Long term, fixed price contracts Revenue on long term, fixed price contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion of services rendered based on the American Institute Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 81 1, "Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts." The Company has applied this method of revenue recognition because projected contract revenues and costs are reasonably estimable based on the Companys business practices, methods and historical experience. This method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates as to resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates. Revisions to the estimates at completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known and reviewed by management. Provisions for 17 estimated losses, if any, on long term, fixed price contracts are recognized in the period in which the loss is determined. Revenue recognition Outsourcing contracts Revenue on outsourcing contracts is recognized based on the services performed or information processed during the period in accordance with contract terms and the agreed upon billing rates applied to the consumed service metrics. In some cases, the Company bills customers prior to performing the service, resulting in deferred revenue which is reported as a current liability in the consolidated financial statements. Outsourcing Contract Costs Costs on outsourcing contracts are generally expensed as incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and charged to expense over the life of the contract. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition costs, including the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection and costs associated with installation of systems and processes. Costs incurred for bid and proposal activities are expensed as incurred. Fixed assets acquired in connection with outsourcing transactions are capitalized and depreciated consistent with policies generally applicable to property and equipment. Amounts paid to the client in excess of the fair market value of acquired property and equipment are capitalized as outsourcing contract costs and amortized over the life of the contract. Management regularly reviews outsourcing contract costs for impairment. Terminations of outsourcing contracts, including transfers either back to the client or to another I/T provider, prior to the end of their committed contract term are infrequent due to the complex transition of personnel, assets, methodologies, and processes involved with outsourcing transactions. In the event of an early termination, the Company and the client, pursuant to certain contractual provisions, engage in negotiations on the recovery of unamortized contracts costs, lost profits, transfer of personnel, rights to implemented systems and processes, as well as other matters. To date, any such terminations have resulted in no material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Contingencies The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business. The Companys consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. The Company consults with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, the Company accrues a liability in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." Other Policies The Company has adopted or will adopt the following accounting pronouncements: SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138; SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations"; SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"; and SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." These standards are explained below under Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 18 eliminates the pooling of interests method and requires that only the purchase method of accounting be used and revises the guidance related to certain identified intangible assets acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized when the new standard is adopted. The new standard also requires an initial goodwill impairment assessment in the year of adoption and impairment tests at least annually thereafter. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 142 effective March 30, 2002. During the first half of fiscal 2003, the Company will complete step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test. The Company has not determined the impact, if any, the transitional goodwill impairment test will have on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any transitional impairment losses will be recorded as the effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company has determined that the impact of no longer amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets was $77.7 million ($74.4 million after tax) or 43 cents per share (diluted) for fiscal 2002, $55.5 million ($52.2 million after tax) or 31 cents per share (diluted) for fiscal 2001 and $39.5 million ($36.2 million after tax) or 21 cents per share (diluted) for fiscal 2000. During August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." SFAS No. 144 addresses existing accounting impairment rules and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 144 effective March 30, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating this statement, but the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement, as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, was effective for CSCs fiscal year 2002. As amended, this statement requires all derivatives to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes accounting standards for hedging activities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forward Looking Statements All statements contained in this annual report, or in any document filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in any press release or other written or oral communication by or on behalf of the Company, that do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements represent the Companys expectations and beliefs, and no assurance can be given that the results described in such statements will be achieved. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of the Companys control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in such statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: (i) competitive pressures; (ii) changes in the global commercial demand for information technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing and consulting and systems integration services; (iii) changes in U.S. federal government spending levels for information technology services; (iv) the Companys ability to continue to develop and expand its service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends; (v) the credit worthiness of the Companys commercial customers; (vi) the Companys ability to recover its accounts receivable and its capital investment in outsourcing contracts; (vii) the future profitability of the Companys long term contracts with customers; (viii) the Companys ability to consummate strategic acquisitions and form alliances; (ix) the Companys ability to attract and retain key personnel, and (x) fluctuations in currency exchange rates in countries in which the Company does business. 19   Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company has fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows. Foreign Currency During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these transactions by ensuring costs to service contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received. Short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. By matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. If necessary, the Company may also use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions. The Company does not foresee changing its foreign currency exposure management strategy. During fiscal 2002, 37% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 3.7% or $421 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 3.7% or $421 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by $30 million. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. At March 29, 2002, the Company had approximately $118 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $39.6 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 20
