Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Business Environment The Companys service and product offerings include information technology services including consulting and systems integration services, outsourcing, and other professional services. CSC provides these services to customers in the global commercial and U.S. federal markets. On a geographic basis, CSC provides services to global commercial customers in the United States, Europe, and Other International locations. Australia, Asia and Canada generate substantially all revenue within Other International. During fiscal 2003, the information technology services industry experienced a reduction in global demand for commercial project oriented activities as customers reduced discretionary spending in response to the economic environment. Based on current indicators, the Company anticipates stabilization of U.S. market demand for consulting and systems integration services, but expects continued pressure on demand for such services in European and Other International markets. While the future demand for outsourcing services is unknown, the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows outsourcing providers to benefit from a certain level of continuity. The U.S. federal government is one of the worlds largest information technology services customers. The U.S. federal and public sector information technology spending are expected to increase in calendar 2003 in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense, homeland security, civil agency modernization, and education. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds and project assignments remain uncertain, the Company expects its information technologies and outsourcing capabilities, including the skill set acquired with DynCorp, to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government. During fiscal 2003, the Companys Global Commercial segment benefited from currency fluctuations in Europe and Other International regions as discussed below. The Company cannot forecast future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results. Revenues Revenues for the Global Commercial and U.S. Federal sector segments (see Note 12) for fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 are as follows: Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Percent Percent Dollars in millions Amount Change Amount Change Amount U.S. Commercial $ 3,868.2 (10 %) $ 4,307.5 5 % $ 4,106.5 Europe 2,981.2 2 2,934.2 14 2,583.6 Other International 1,151.6 (9 ) 1,264.0 4 1,216.0 Global Commercial 8,001.0 (6 ) 8,505.7 8 7,906.1 U.S. Federal Sector 3,347.4 17 2,873.3 11 2,586.7 Corporate (1.9 ) .2 .1 Total $ 11,346.5 0 $ 11,379.2 8 $ 10,492.9 The Companys overall revenue declined by $32.7 million for fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002. Declines in Global Commercial segment revenues were substantially offset by the U.S. Federal sectors 17% revenue growth. The Company announced $7.7 billion in new business awards during fiscal 2003 compared with $11.4 billion and $10.9 billion announced for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. Global Commercial revenue declined 6%, or $504.8 million, during fiscal 2003. In constant currency, Global Commercial revenue declined approximately 10%. The Company announced $5.0 billion in new Global Commercial business awards during fiscal 2003 compared with the $3.6 billion announced during fiscal 2002 and $8.2 billion announced during fiscal 2001. 10 For fiscal 2003, U.S. Commercial revenue declined by 10%, or $439.3 million. Approximately one third of this decline is attributable to reduced demand for consulting and systems integration services. Substantially the entire consulting and systems integration decline occurred in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2003 with stabilization in demand taking place in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003. The balance of the U.S. Commercial revenue decline is attributable to expiration of outsourcing contracts and client reductions in billable volumes and discretionary projects, partially offset by over $170.0 million in new outsourcing engagements. For fiscal 2002, U.S. Commercial revenue grew 5%, or $201.0 million. This growth was principally generated by outsourcing engagements including additional activities on the Nortel Networks, BAE Systems, General Dynamics and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. contracts and further expansion in the Companys financial services vertical markets including the benefit associated with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Mynd Corporation (Mynd). Revenue growth was impacted by a significant decrease in consulting and systems integration revenue. The Companys European operations generated fiscal 2003 growth of 2%, or $47 million. Outsourcing revenue growth of approximately 10% was substantially offset by a revenue decline in consulting and systems integration services including the financial services vertical market. Sources of outsourcing revenue growth included BAE Systems, Nortel Networks, British Nuclear Fuels Limited, and Whitbread accounts and the impact of new business including Bombardier, United Kingdom Department of Health, and Allders. Currency fluctuations favorably impacted European revenue by approximately 10% points. For fiscal 2002 compared to 2001, the Companys European operations generated growth of 14%, or $350.6 million. In constant currency, European revenue growth was approximately 17%. The growth was mainly attributable to outsourcing services in the United Kingdom including additional activities associated with automotive services, Australian Mutual Provident (AMP), BAE Systems and Schroders Bank. Other International revenue declined by 9%, or $112.4 million, during fiscal 2003. The decline was primarily attributable to reduced product sales and related services reflecting the economic downturn in Asian markets. Currency fluctuations in Australia and Asia favorably impacted Other International revenue growth by approximately 5% points. For fiscal 2002, Other International operations provided revenue growth of 4%, or $48.0 million. In constant currency, Other International growth was approximately 10%. The growth was primarily attributable to expansion from outsourcing contracts including activities associated with Nortel Networks and a new outsourcing contract with the Northern Territory Government in Australia. Other International revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by reduced demand for services in Asia due to weakness in the Asian economies. The Companys U.S. Federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources: Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Percent Percent Dollars in millions Amount Change Amount Change Amount Department of Defense $ 1,904.9 8 % $ 1,769.0 10 % $ 1,607.1 Civil agencies 1,364.4 34 1,019.7 14 898.0 Other 78.1 (8 ) 84.6 4 81.6 Total U.S. Federal sector $ 3,347.4 17 $ 2,873.3 11 $ 2,586.7 Revenues from the U.S. Federal sector increased 17% during fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002. The contribution of former DynCorp operations from the date of acquisition, March 7, 2003 to March 28, 2003 accounted for $166.0 million or approximately 6% of U.S. Federal sectors revenue growth. The remaining revenue growth of 11%, or $308.1 million, is principally attributable to new and increased work related to intelligence community activities, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Prime contract, General Services Administration contracts, and an Immigration and Naturalization Service contract. Revenues for fiscal 2002 compared with fiscal 2001 increased 11%. The increase was principally related to new and increased work related to intelligence community activities, the Army Logistics Modernization contract (LOGMOD), the IRS Prime contract and several other task order activities on both Civil agency and Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. 11 During fiscal 2003, CSC announced federal contract awards with a total value of $2.7 billion, compared with the $7.8 billion and $2.7 billion announced during fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. Federal contract awards for fiscal 2002 included a single intelligence community award with an anticipated value of $5.0 billion. During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff indicated the guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products) should be applied broadly to all forms of consideration provided by a vendor to its customer, and all arrangements in which an entity pays cash or other forms of consideration to its customers. Accordingly, such consideration is now accounted for as a reduction of revenue. The Company acquires information technology assets from outsourcing clients at negotiated prices and subsequently records the assets at their fair values. Any excess paid over the fair value amounts (the premium) is included in outsourcing contract costs and amortized over the contract life. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 01 09, amortization of premiums has been reclassified from costs and expenses to a reduction of revenue beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Prior period amounts have been classified to conform to current year presentation. These amounts reduced revenues and total costs and expenses by less than 1%, with no impact on income. Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Dollar Amount Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Costs of services $ 9,068.2 $ 9,187.2 $ 8,406.8 79.9 % 80.7 % 80.1 % Selling, general and administrative 716.9 741.9 814.9 6.3 6.5 7.8 Depreciation and amortization 810.3 810.8 618.2 7.1 7.1 5.9 Interest expense, net 134.3 142.5 89.8 1.2 1.3 .9 Special items 5.2 232.9 2.2 Total $ 10,734.9 $ 10,882.4 $ 10,162.6 94.5 % 95.6 % 96.9 % Costs of Services For fiscal 2003, the Companys costs of services as a percentage of revenue decreased to 79.9% from 80.7%. Performance improvements in our U.S. outsourcing operations resulting from cost containment efforts, consolidation of regional and back office functions in multiple geographies, and use of less costly offshore sites contributed 1.2% points of improvement. Performance improvements in our U.S. Federal sector, U.S. consulting and systems integration, and Other International operations contributed equally to .6% points of improvement. Europe operations caused a ..6% point adverse shift, primarily due to revenue shortfalls resulting from soft I/T project demand. Shifts in the mix of our business toward federal operations, which carry a higher ratio of costs of services, caused an adverse movement of .4% points. The Companys costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 80.7% from 80.1% for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. The change was primarily related to a decrease in demand for commercial consulting and systems integration services, which decreased utilization and impacted revenue realization. The Company also experienced cost pressure on certain outsourcing contracts. During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company reclassified the provision for doubtful accounts from costs of services to selling, general and administrative. Prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current year presentation. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 6.3% from 6.5% for fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002. The reduction in SG&A is attributable to a $14.2 million decrease in 12 provision for doubtful accounts and European performance improvements of approximately $29.0 million partially offset by U.S. Commercial and Other International performance decline. The favorable impact of a shift in the Companys business mix towards the U.S. Federal sector, where SG&A costs are lower as a percentage of revenue than the Companys composite, substantially offset a decline in the U.S. Federal sectors performance in SG&A. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 6.5% from 7.8% for fiscal 2002 versus fiscal 2001. The decrease was due to the Companys continued cost reduction initiatives, managements focus on discretionary costs and consolidation of certain back office services. During the year, the Company realigned certain functions in its U.S. healthcare operations with similar functions into other groups and integrated its Pinnacle Alliance unit into the financial services vertical operations. The majority of the increase in the provision related to customer credit risks associated with certain parties for whom the Company provided systems integration and consulting professional services. Depreciation and Amortization The Companys fiscal 2003 depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was virtually unchanged compared to fiscal 2002. Last years depreciation and amortization expense included $77.7 million related to goodwill and employee workforce amortization which is no longer amortized as a result of the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 on March 30, 2002. An approximate .7% point improvement in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue from the absence of amortization of goodwill and employee workforce acquired was offset by depreciation related to additional investments during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 in equipment and contract costs in support of our outsourcing clients. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 7.1% from 5.9% for fiscal 2002 versus fiscal 2001. The increase was due primarily to the additional depreciation and amortization of assets associated with the Companys increased outsourcing activities and increased goodwill amortization related to the December 2000 acquisition of Mynd. Interest Expense The $8.2 million decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2003 net of interest income resulted from a lower average outstanding debt partially offset by a higher average interest rate and decreased interest income. The increase of $52.7 million for fiscal 2002 resulted principally from the increased debt associated with funding the Mynd acquisition and purchases related to outsourcing activities. Special Items In connection with the DynCorp acquisition in March 2003, the Company reviewed its operations, product strategies and the carrying value of its assets to identify any potential exit or disposal activities. As a result, during the fourth quarter ended March 28, 2003, special items of $5.2 million ($3.3 million after tax) or 2 cents per share (diluted) were recorded. The special items related to software associated with prior CSC operations now redundant to similar assets acquired with DynCorp. In addition, certain identified equipment can no longer accommodate the larger, integrated U.S. Federal sector business, and its use will be discontinued during the first two quarters of fiscal 2004, which will result in an estimated charge of $22.0 million. The Company anticipates completing the exit and disposal activities related to the DynCorp acquisition by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2002, the Company reviewed its estimates related to the fiscal 2001 special charge (discussion below) and made certain adjustments. These adjustments increased the facilities consolidation provision by $4 million to $29.6 million. This adjustment was offset by a decrease of $3 million related to the phased out operations and other assets provisions and by a decrease of $1 million related to employee severance costs. These adjustments resulted in total special charges related to phased out operations and other assets of $17.9 million. The decrease in employee severance costs was due to 109 fewer U.S. employee 13 involuntary terminations. As a result of renegotiations of certain international employee severance agreements, the Company involuntarily terminated an additional 285 international employees. The net impact was an additional 176 employees involuntarily terminated and a $1 million reduction related to employee severance costs. As a result of these actions, there was no net additional special charge recorded during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2001, special items of $232.9 million ($156.0 million after tax) were recorded as detailed below. In response to a changing mix of information technology services, business conditions and overall demand for consulting and systems integration services, the Company reviewed its global operations. As a result of this review, a special item of $137.5 million ($91.3 million after tax) or 54 cents per share (diluted) was recorded during the fourth quarter ended March 30, 2001. Included in the charge was employee severance costs of $67.9 million, write offs in connection with consolidation of facilities of $25.6 million, write off of capitalized software and computer related assets of $22.1 million and $20.9 million related to phased out operations and other assets. The involuntary termination benefits accrued and expensed of $67.9 million related to 1,896 employees of which 722 were U.S. employees and 1,174 were international employees. As of March 28, 2003, all involuntary termination benefits have been paid and all affected employees have been terminated. Less than $5 million of accrued costs related to consolidation of facilities remained at March 28, 2003. In connection with the December 2000 acquisition of Mynd, the Company reviewed its global commercial financial services operations, product strategies and the carrying value of its assets. As a result, special items were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2001. During the third quarter ended December 29, 2000, special items of $84.2 million ($57.3 million after tax), or 34 cents per share (diluted) were recorded and included, $58.2 million related to non cash adjustments to the carrying value of capitalized software and the write off of other assets and intangibles and $9.4 million related to a legal settlement and write off of assets from operations previously sold or phased out. The third quarter charge also included $16.6 million accrued for employee severance costs. In the fourth quarter, the amount for employee severance costs was adjusted to $14.5 million. The employee severance costs related to 628 global commercial financial services employees. All of the severance payments have been made and all of the employees have been involuntarily terminated. Upon completion of the integration of Mynd during the fourth quarter ended March 30, 2001, the Company recorded an additional special item of $11.2 million ($7.4 million after tax) or 4 cents per share (diluted) for the write off of capitalized software and a provision for consolidation of facilities. The $11.2 million was the net special item after the severance adjustment described above. Income Before Taxes The Companys income before taxes and margin for the most recent three fiscal years is as follows: Dollar Amount Margin Dollars in millions 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Income before taxes $ 611.6 $ 496.8 $ 330.3 5.4 % 4.4 % 3.1 % During fiscal 2003, income before taxes as a percentage of revenue increased to 5.4%. Included in fiscal 2002 income before taxes is a .7%, or $77.7 million, impact of amortization of goodwill and employee workforce acquired which are no longer amortized. The remaining increase relates to improved performance in costs of services and selling, general and administrative costs offset by increases in other depreciation and amortization as described above. Income before taxes and margin for fiscal 2003 include special items of $5.2 million described above in caption Special Items. Taxes The provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax earnings was 28.0%, 30.7% and 29.4% for the three years ended March 28, 2003. The decrease of 2.7% points in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 resulted from the ceasing of goodwill and employee workforce amortization in fiscal 2003, which decreased the effective rate by approximately 3.5% points. This decrease was partially offset by the reduced 14 relative impact of permanent tax differences. The change in effective tax rate to 30.7% from 29.4% for fiscal 2002 is principally related to the tax benefit of higher marginal rates applied to the fiscal 2001 special charge. The tax rate applied to special items was 37.5% and 33.0% for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2001, respectively. Net Income and Earnings per Share The Companys net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2003, fiscal 2002, and fiscal 2001 are as follows: Dollar Amount Margin Dollars in millions, except EPS 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Net income $ 440.2 $ 344.1 $ 233.2 3.9 % 3.0 % 2.2 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.54 $ 2.01 $ 1.37 The net earnings margin was 3.9% for fiscal 2003, 3.0% for fiscal 2002 and 2.2% for fiscal 2001. The improvement for fiscal 2003 was principally attributable to lower costs of services and selling, general and administrative expenses. During fiscal 2002, the Companys net income margin increased to 3% from 2.2% for fiscal 2001 primarily due to the impact of the fiscal 2001 special items, partially offset by the fiscal 2002 increases in costs of services, depreciation and amortization and interest expense as described above. Cash Flows Dollars in millions Fiscal 2003 Fiscal 2002 Fiscal 2001 Net cash from operations $ 1,148.2 $ 1,305.4 $ 854.2 Net cash used in investing (994.0 ) (1,205.7 ) (2,243.4 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing (20.2 ) (133.9 ) 1,321.5 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 16.5 (1.4 ) (8.0 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 150.5 (35.6 ) (75.7 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 149.1 184.7 260.4 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 299.6 $ 149.1 $ 184.7 Historically, the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents has been provided from operating activities. During fiscal 2003, net cash provided from operations decreased primarily due to a reduction in payables and accrued expenses, net of acquired DynCorp balances, partially offset by additional net earnings and a lesser increase in accounts receivable. The Companys investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software, facilities, and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the Companys expanding Global Commercial and U.S. Federal sector operations. Investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as subsequent upgrades, expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets. The Companys investments also include acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, including significant amounts for the fiscal 2003 acquisition of DynCorp and the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Mynd. As described above, historically a majority of the Companys capital investments have been funded by cash from operations. The Company issued 15 million shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to partially fund the DynCorp acquisition. In addition, the Company issued $300 million of 5.00% notes due February 15, 2013. The funds were used for general corporate purposes, including reduction of outstanding commercial paper which had increased as a result of paying off assumed DynCorp debt and the cash portion of the DynCorp consideration. During fiscal 2002, the Company issued $500 million of 6.75% notes due June 2006 and $500 million of 7.375% notes due June 2011. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including the reduction of outstanding commercial paper. 15 Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $299.6 million at March 28, 2003, $149.1 million at March 29, 2002 and $184.7 million at March 30, 2001. During this period, the Companys earnings have added to equity. During fiscal 2003, foreign currency translation adjustment increased equity by $165.0 million while unfunded pension obligations decreased equity by $90.3 million. At the end of fiscal 2003, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 35.0%. Dollars in millions 2003 2002 2001 Debt $ 2,479.7 $ 2,204.1 $ 2,384.0 Equity 4,606.4 3,623.6 3,215.2 Total capitalization $ 7,086.1 $ 5,827.7 $ 5,599.2 Debt to total capitalization 35.0 % 37.8 % 42.6 % At March 28, 2003, the Company had a commercial paper program, backed by two syndicated credit facilities, with a total capacity of $671.0 million. The credit facilities were comprised of a $321.0 million facility, which expires on August 18, 2005 and a $350.0 million facility, which expires August 15, 2003. At March 28, 2003, approximately $470.0 million was available for borrowing under this program compared to $497.8 million at the end of fiscal 2002. At March 28, 2003, the Company had $201.0 million borrowings under the commercial paper program and is in compliance with all terms of the agreements. In addition, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit of $511.1 million available with certain foreign banks. During fiscal 2003, the Company issued 15 million shares of common stock and $300 million worth of term debt from its fiscal 2002 shelf registration. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations by period as of March 28, 2003: Less than 1 3 3 5 More than Dollars in millions 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total Long term debt $ 701.0 $ 498.9 $ 993.3 $ 2,193.2 Capital lease obligations $ 22.2 8.2 1.9 32.3 Operating leases 331.5 423.7 222.9 234.2 1,212.3 Minimum purchase obligations 465.4 755.1 359.4 63.5 1,643.4 Other long term liabilities 2.7 1.1 .4 .1 4.3 Total $ 821.8 $ 1,889.1 $ 1,083.5 $ 1,291.1 $ 5,085.5 Regarding minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services that are necessary for the operations of business activities. The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from 1 to 5 years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company would have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall. In the normal course of business, the Company may provide certain customers and potential customers with financial performance guarantees, which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which is remote in managements opinion. The Company is in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee, and any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position. In addition, the Company has other guarantees that represent parent guarantees in support of working capital uncommitted lines of credit established with local financial institutions for its foreign business units. Borrowings under these lines were $49.9 million at March 28, 2003. 16 The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of March 28, 2003: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2006 & Dollars in millions 2004 2005 thereafter Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 55.2 $ 3.0 $ 58.2 Letters of credit 16.2 $ 22.1 38.3 Other surety bonds 15.3 3.1 18.4 Standby letters of credit 61.1 61.1 Subsidiary debt guarantees 469.2 40.0 509.2 Total $ 617.0 $ 46.1 $ 22.1 $ 685.2 As of March 28, 2003, the amount of outstanding subsidiary debt under the subsidiary debt guarantees noted above was $49.9 million. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, cash balances, unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 13 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Companys sources of debt include the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowings. If the Company were unable to sell commercial paper or if the Company determined it was too costly to do so, the Company has the ability to borrow under the two syndicated backstop credit facilities. Dividends and Redemption It has been the Companys policy to invest earnings in the growth of the Company rather than distribute earnings as dividends. This policy, under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal 1969, is expected to continue, but is subject to regular review by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Policies The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Companys critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition include long term contracts, outsourcing contracts, and software sales. The Company also has critical accounting policies addressing outsourcing contract costs, software development costs, and retirement benefits. Revenue recognition Long term contracts The Company provides services under time and materials, level of effort, cost based, unit price and fixed price contracts. For time and materials and level of effort types of contracts, revenue is recorded when services are provided at agreed upon billing rates. For cost based contracts, revenue is recorded at the time such fees are probable and estimable by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred, such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience. Revenue is recognized on unit price contracts based on unit metrics times the agreed upon contract unit price. Revenue on long term, fixed price development contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion if the Company can dependably estimate and measure the extent of progress and the cost to complete. The Company applies this method of revenue recognition because projected contract revenues and costs are reasonably estimable based on the Companys business practices, methods and historical experience. The method requires estimates of costs and profits over 17 the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates. Revisions to the estimates at completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which the loss is determined. Revenue recognition Outsourcing contracts Revenue on outsourcing contracts is recognized based on the services performed or information processed during the period in accordance with contract terms and the agreed upon billing rates applied to the consumed service metrics. Revenue recognition Software sales Revenue from sales of proprietary software are recognized upon receipt of a signed contract documenting customer commitment, delivery of the software and determination of the fee amount and its probable collection. However, if significant customization is required, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method. Costs incurred in connection with sales of proprietary software are expensed as incurred, except for the costs of developing computer software products, which are capitalized and amortized over the life of the software products. Outsourcing Contract Costs Costs on outsourcing contracts are generally expensed as incurred. However, certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition costs, including the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection and costs associated with installation of systems and processes. Costs incurred for bid and proposal activities are expensed as incurred. Fixed assets acquired in connection with outsourcing transactions are capitalized and depreciated consistent with fixed asset policies described in Note 1. Amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired property and equipment (premiums) are capitalized as outsourcing contract costs and amortized over the contract life. The amortization of such outsourcing contract cost premiums is accounted for as a reduction in revenue, as described in Note 1. Management regularly reviews outsourcing contract costs for impairment. Terminations of outsourcing contracts, including transfers either back to the client or to another I/T provider, prior to the end of their committed contract term are infrequent due to the complex transition of personnel, assets, methodologies, and processes involved with outsourcing transactions. In the event of an early termination, the Company and the client, pursuant to certain contractual provisions, engage in negotiations on the recovery of unamortized contract costs, lost profits, transfer of personnel, rights to implemented systems and processes, as well as other matters. Software Development Costs The Company capitalizes costs incurred to develop commercial software products after technological feasibility has been established. Costs incurred to establish technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred. Enhancements to software products are capitalized where such enhancements extend the life or significantly expand the marketability of the products. Capitalized software is amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product. The amortization expense is not less than the straight line amortization expense over the product useful life. The Company capitalizes costs incurred to develop internal use computer software. Internal and external costs incurred in connection with development of upgrades or enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized. These capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. Purchased software is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. 18 Retirement Benefits The Company offers a number of pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to account for pension and postretirement plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require significant assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. In making these assumptions, we are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors. Our fiscal 2003 pension plan valuations utilized a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.1% compared to 8.4% used in fiscal 2002. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the net periodic pension cost by approximately $7 million. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. Our fiscal 2003 pension plan valuations utilized a weighted average discount rate of 6.3% compared to 6.8% used in fiscal 2002. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately $19 million or increased it by approximately $20 million, respectively. SFAS No. 87 requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at the end of the year. As of March 28, 2003, some of the Companys pension plans had ABOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets for which we recognized an additional minimum obligation resulting in an increase in intangible assets of $24.5 million and a charge to equity of $90.3 million, net of tax. Based on future plan asset performance and interest rates, additional charges to equity may be required. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized when the new standard is adopted. The new standard also requires an initial goodwill impairment assessment in the year of adoption and annual impairment tests thereafter. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 30, 2002. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. During the second quarter ended September 27, 2002, the Company completed the initial goodwill assessment and the annual goodwill impairment test. No impairment losses were identified as a result of these tests. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 addresses existing accounting impairment rules and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The Company adopted this statement on March 30, 2002. Adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 62, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 clarifies guidance 19 related to the classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt and resolves inconsistencies related to the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications. The provision of SFAS No. 145 related to the extinguishment of debt will be effective for the Company on March 29, 2003. The provision of SFAS No. 145 related to the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications was effective for all transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. Adoption of this statement did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 replaces previous accounting guidance provided by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) and was effective for the Company for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this statement impacted the accounting of exit and disposal activities related to the acquisition of DynCorp as discussed in the caption Special Items above. Additionally, this statement could impact the accounting for future exit or disposal activities. In November 2002 and May 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue 00 21 provides guidance and criteria for determining when a multiple deliverable arrangement contains more than one unit of accounting. The guidance also addresses methods of measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to separate units of accounting. The guidance will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into after June 15, 2003. The Company presently intends to adopt this statement prospectively and the Company does not anticipate a material impact to the Companys financial condition or results of operation as a result of adoption. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The interpretation requires disclosure about the nature and terms of obligations under certain guarantees that the Company has issued. The interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing a guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective immediately. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The interpretation clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and variable interest entities in which the Company obtains an interest after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities in which a company obtained an interest before February 1, 2003, the interpretation applies to the interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Adoption of this interpretation did not have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. The statement will be effective for the Companys fiscal 2004 and adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations as the Company will continue to account for stock based compensation as described in Note 1. 20 In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. Adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 01 08, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease. EITF Issue No. 01 08 provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases. The guidance in Issue No. 01 08 is based on whether the arrangement conveys to the purchaser (lessee) the right to use a specific asset. The Issue 01 08 will be effective for arrangements entered into or modified in the Companys second quarter of fiscal 2004. The Company is currently evaluating EITF Issue No. 01 08 and has not determined the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company has fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows. Foreign Currency During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these transactions by ensuring costs to service contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received. Short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. By matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. If necessary, the Company may also use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions. The Company does not foresee changing its foreign currency exposure management strategy. During fiscal 2003, 36.5% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 3.65% or $414.0 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 3.65% or $414.0 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by $27.9 million. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. At March 28, 2003, the Company had approximately $193.7 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $51.0 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 22
