Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC or the Company). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended April 1, 2005. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: to provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; to enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes, providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed; and to provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. To achieve these objectives, the discussion is presented in the following sections: Overview includes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash, as well as a discussion of the key business drivers, economic and industry factors, fiscal 2005 highlights and fiscal 2006 commentary. Results of Operations discusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal 2003 to 2005, describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reporting segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and currency impacts, and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories. Financial Condition discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the Companys liquidity position and available capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimates discusses accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors that May Affect Future Results describes the nature of forward looking statements and lists several factors that may affect future results. OVERVIEW The Companys primary service offerings are outsourcing and I/T and professional services. Outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customers technology infrastructure and applications, and business process outsourcing. I/T and professional services include systems integration, consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services. CSC provides these services to customers in the Global Commercial and U.S. federal government markets. On a geographic basis, CSC provides services to Global Commercial customers in the United States, Europe and other international locations. Operations in Australia, Asia and Canada generate substantially all revenue within Other International. Economic and Industry Factors Global Commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on I/T projects. CSC is in a highly competitive industry which pressures pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors, including service offerings and 12 flexibility. Management monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. The U.S. federal market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract is terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed. Shifting priorities of the U.S. government can also impact the future of projects. The Company recognized the U.S. governments increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development efforts in these areas. Management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts, legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations. Business Drivers Revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting from less than six months to 10 years or more. Factors affecting revenue include: the Companys ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards, the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes, the ability to compete on price, services offered, technical ability, experience and flexibility, the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues, the ability to successfully identify and divest non core operations which may impact revenue in the short term but provide resources to pursue longer term growth opportunities, and for international business, currency fluctuations. Earnings are driven by the above revenue factors, in addition to the following: the ability to control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs, the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses, and the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals. Cash flows are impacted by the above earnings, in addition to other factors including the following: timely management of receivables and payables, investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts, and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments. Key Performance Indicators The Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue growth, margins, cash flow and return on investment. 13 New contract wins In addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the Companys ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous external factors. CSC employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts. Revenue growth Year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth. Margins Margins reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of acquisitions or dispositions of business with different cost profiles, as with the impact of the March 2003 Dyncorp acquisition, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of off shore support also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations. Cash flow A primary driver affecting CSCs cash flow is the ability to manage receivables and payables. Thus, a review of the receivables measurement of days sales outstanding (DSO) supports an ongoing focus on timely collections. The Company also regularly reviews the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements of operating, investing and financing cash flows. Return on investment (ROI) ROI is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization. A combination of strong margins (measures how efficiently profit is generated from revenue) and investment base turnover (measures how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital) is required to generate sufficient returns on capital. In addition, the timing of cash flows impacts ROI, so that large, up front investments particularly on new outsourcing contracts require higher margins in order to generate adequate ROI. Readers should be cautioned that DSO, free cash flow and ROI are not GAAP measures, and that the Companys definition of such measures may differ from other companies. Therefore, such measures may not be comparable to other companies. CSC calculates DSO as follows: Total receivables at quarter end divided by revenue per day. Revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the fiscal quarter. Free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating and investing cash flows, excluding acquisitions and dispositions and purchases or sales of available for sale securities. ROI is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover. The profit margin used is profit before interest and special items and after tax divided by revenues. Investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity. Fiscal 2005 Highlights A significant event during fiscal 2005 was the February divestiture of the Companys DynCorp International and DynMarine units and selected DynCorp Technical Services contracts (referred to collectively as DynCorp International or DI). The DI operations were purchased with DynCorp in March 2003. All results reported here classify these operations as discontinued operations. Also, the Company exchanged its Health Plans Solutions business for shares of CSC stock in April 2005. These operations also are classified as discontinued operations in this Report. The DynCorp International divestiture resulted in an after tax gain of $228.8 million on $850 million of proceeds, consisting of $775 million of cash and $75 million of paid in kind preferred stock, reported in fiscal 2005. Additional gain is expected to be realized in fiscal 2006 from working capital adjustment 14 consideration expected to be received, which will increase the gain. Net income from the DI operations for the year was $73.2 million, an increase of 117% from fiscal 2004, notwithstanding fiscal 2005s partial year results. Revenue for the partial year of discontinued DI operations was $1,683.7 million, up 40% from fiscal 2004. Health Plans Solutions realized net income of $11.8 million for fiscal 2005 versus $9.3 million for fiscal 2004. Revenues were $107.8 million versus $114.2 million for fiscal 2005 versus fiscal 2004, respectively. As the results of operations of DI and Health Plan Solutions are reported as discontinued operations, all revenue commentary, unless otherwise noted, refers to continuing operations only. Continuing operations highlights for the year included: Revenues rose 4.5%, approximately 1.8% before currency fluctuations. Net income grew 5.6%. Continuing earnings per share were up 2.8%, 3.1% before special items. Contract awards of $16.0 billion were announced, a record for CSC, with new Global Commercial awards totaling $9.0 billion and new U.S. Federal awards of $7.0 billion. Cash flows from operating activities generated $1.9 billion versus $1.7 billion in fiscal 2004, investing activities used cash of $.6 billion ($1.4 billion before disposition proceeds of $.8 billion) versus $1.3 billion in the prior year, and free cash flow grew to $501 million, up from $355 million in fiscal 2004. DSO improved to 83 days at year end, down from 85 days at the end of the prior year. Debt to total capitalization ratio was 17.6% at year end, improved from 30.1% a year earlier, results that include the impact of $1 billion in debt retirement. ROI for the year on total operations was 8.7% flat compared with the prior year. The Companys level of announced new business awards was the highest in CSCs history. Significant wins included the following: Global Commercial: General Dynamics ($1.60 billion), Ascension Health ($1.35 billion), Zurich Financial Services ($1.3 billion), Textron Incorporated ($1.1 billion), Aon ($600 million), Sun Microsystems ($360 million), and Renault ($236 million). U.S. Federal: U.S. Navy SeaPort Enhanced ($950 million), U.S. Navys Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center ($762 million), Federal Aviation Administration ($589 million), U.S. Strategic Command ($525 million), 15 U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command ($500 million), and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ($280 million). These multi year awards represent the estimated value at contract signing. However, they cannot be considered firm orders due to their variable attributes, including demand driven usage, modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements, annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the Companys U.S. Federal activities. Revenue growth in the Global Commercial sector was the result of recent years significant contract wins, particularly in Europe. U.S. Federal sector wins have also been strong, but for fiscal 2005 their revenue impact was offset by the completion, reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant programs. Currency shifts during the year also favorably impacted revenue. The Companys growth has created a broad, long term global revenue base across numerous customers, industries, geographic regions and service offerings. Approximately 80% of CSCs revenues come from long term contracts including Global Commercial outsourcing and U.S. federal government engagements. An increase in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2005 reduced the Companys use of commercial paper during the year. This reduction in commercial paper coupled with the redemption of $1 billion of term debt during fiscal 2005 significantly reduced the debt to total capitalization ratio at year end. The increase in cash flow from operations was driven by higher earnings during fiscal 2005 as well as an increase in non cash expenses and deferred revenue. Fiscal 2006 Commentary As a top ten contractor and I/T service provider to the U.S. federal government, CSCs U.S. Federal sector is well positioned to benefit from anticipated growing demand. The U.S. federal government is one of the worlds largest I/T services consumers, and its spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense, homeland security and civil agency modernization. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds and project assignments can vary, the Company expects its broad I/T and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government. While demand for I/T outsourcing services continues to grow, particularly in Europe, the I/T services industry continued to experience overall flat global demand for commercial project oriented activities during fiscal 2005. Many customers maintained lower levels of discretionary spending in response to the economic environment in their region, particularly in Central Europe. However, indications suggest stabilization in the North American markets demand for consulting and systems integration services, although the Company expects continued global price pressure resulting from supply conditions. Worldwide global demand for outsourcing services is expected to be strong again during fiscal 2006, particularly for business process outsourcing (BPO). To capitalize on the expanding human resources (HR) BPO market, CSC entered into a strategic alliance with Aon Human Resources Outsourcing to deliver HR BPO services. While the future demand for outsourcing services is not known with certainty, the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows CSC to benefit from a certain level of continuity. Thus, the record setting year of new business awards for continuing operations, much of which came from new outsourcing engagements is expected to generate growth in fiscal 2006 Global Commercial revenues. During fiscal 2005, the Companys Global Commercial segment benefited from currency fluctuations in Europe and Other International regions. The Company cannot forecast with certainty future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results. The Companys overall short term financial objectives include: 1. Successfully launch the numerous new contracts won during fiscal 2005, with particular focus on the large new outsourcing contracts. 16 2. Effectively manage working capital and capital investment. 3. Maintain appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins, particularly focusing on the new business, in order to generate an improved return on investment. 4. Pursue the large current pipeline of commercial and U.S. Federal opportunities and win the Companys proportionate share. 5. Strategically deploy the proceeds of recent divestitures to further strengthen the Companys financial position and capitalize on growth and expansion opportunities. The Companys primary long term objective is to continue developing and obtaining the core capabilities and differentiating factors that will enable CSC to compete effectively in both the Federal and Global Commercial markets. The Company will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that enhance its core capabilities and review its portfolio of business operations for overall strategic fit. Continued long term revenue and earnings growth will come from the combination of internal growth and acquisitions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues for the Global Commercial and U.S. Federal sector segments (see Note 14) for fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 are as follows: Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount U.S. Commercial $ 3,829.7 7.2 % $ 3,572.0 (4.6 )% $ 3,742.8 Europe 4,325.7 17.5 3,681.8 23.5 2,981.2 Other International 1,227.3 1.4 1,210.8 5.1 1,151.6 Global Commercial sector 9,382.7 10.8 8,464.6 7.5 7,875.6 U.S. Federal sector 4,675.9 (6.2 ) 4,983.1 51.5 3,288.6 Corporate .2 (1.9 ) Total $ 14,058.6 4.5 $ 13,447.9 20.5 $ 11,162.3 The major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows: Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal 2004 Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total U.S. Commercial 7.2 % 7.2 % Europe 8.5 % 9.0 17.5 Other International 5.0 (3.6 ) 1.4 Global Commercial sector 4.4 6.4 10.8 U.S. Federal sector (6.2 ) (6.2 ) Corporate Total 2.7 1.8 4.5 17 Fiscal 2004 vs. Fiscal 2003 DynCorp Acquisition Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total U.S. Commercial (4.6 )% (4.6 )% Europe 16.1 % 7.4 23.5 Other International 13.4 (8.3 ) 5.1 Global Commercial sector 8.1 (.6 ) 7.5 U.S. Federal sector 49.2 % 2.3 51.5 Corporate Total 14.5 5.7 .3 20.5 For fiscal 2005 revenue performance versus fiscal 2004, the impact of significant new commercial engagements offset the impact of the completion, reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant Federal programs. Global Commercial growth for fiscal 2005 of 10.8% (6.4% in constant currency) was led by the European region, where new outsourcing engagements offset continued weak demand for consulting and systems integration. U.S. operations also benefited from recent major contract wins but additionally saw modest growth in consulting and systems integration revenue. In the U.S. Federal sector, the impact of $7.0 billion of announced contract awards did not offset revenue declines on certain programs, and fiscal 2005 revenue declined 6.2% to $4.7 billion. The most significant drivers of revenue growth for fiscal 2004 were the full year impact of the March 2003 DynCorp acquisition and the impact of currency fluctuations, which contributed 14.5% and 5.7% of growth, respectively. The remaining overall internal growth of a net .3% was the result of growth in the Global Commercial segments European region and growth in the U.S. Federal sectors defense business, offset by declines in other Global Commercial regions as well as in Federal sectors civil business. Strong outsourcing revenue growth in Global Commercial, particularly in the United Kingdom and Europes Nordic region, was offset by reduced consulting and systems integration work. The Companys announced $14.7 billion in new business awards compared with $7.7 billion announced for fiscal 2003. Global Commercial Global Commercial revenue growth was 10.8% for fiscal 2005, or 6.4% in constant currency. New major engagements continue to be the Companys significant driver of Global Commercial revenue growth, contributing approximately $854 million of fiscal 2005 revenue. These engagements encompass both outsourcing and other I/T and professional services. Announced commercial contract wins totaled $9.0 billion for fiscal 2005 and $9.7 billion for fiscal 2004, CSCs two most successful years ever for that measure. Existing base revenues declined somewhat for fiscal 2005, due to normal contract completions and declines as productivity increases are reflected in declining bill rates to clients. Europe revenues increased $644 million for fiscal 2005, representing 17.5% growth, 9.0% in constant currency. Major new engagements contributing to this performance included the U.K. National Health Service and the European operations of Zurich Financial Services, as well as the full year impact of the fiscal 2004 SAS Group and National Grid Transco contract commencements. Revenue growth attributable to these new engagements of approximately $572 million and favorable currency movement of approximately $310 million were offset by continued weakness in demand for the Companys consulting and systems integration services in Continental Europe as well as reduced scope on certain existing outsourcing engagements. Europe has seen growth in the outsourcing market with economic conditions driving the adoption of outsourcing to help improve business performance. By focusing on large opportunities, the Company has significantly improved its market position as highlighted by the wins noted above. 18 U.S. commercial revenue increased by $258 million or 7.2%. This growth is primarily attributable to new fiscal 2005 and 2004 outsourcing contracts with the U.S. operations of Zurich Financial Services, Aon, Ascension Health, Textron and Motorola, with total fiscal 2005 revenue growth impact of approximately $221 million. This impact and slight growth in the Companys U.S. consulting and systems integration business were offset somewhat by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain major outsourcing contracts. The Companys outsourcing contract with Sears, Roebuck & Co., which was terminated subsequent to year end, provided $105 million of revenue during fiscal 2005 and favorably impacted revenue growth for the year. Other International revenues were up $16.5 million from fiscal 2004, though down 3.6% in constant currency, primarily the result of reduced product sales, including the closure of a product reseller business in Australia. These reductions were offset somewhat by increased outsourcing revenues including the full year effect from the Companys engagement with Malayan Banking Berhad. Major outsourcing contract wins during fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 accounted for approximately $684 million of fiscal 2004 Global Commercial revenue growth versus fiscal 2003, driven by growing European outsourcing markets and increased market share. These increases from outsourcing were more than offset by declines in consulting, systems integration and other areas, resulting in a net decline of .6% for the year on a constant currency basis. The Company announced $9.7 billion in new Global Commercial business awards during fiscal 2004 compared with the $5.0 billion announced during fiscal 2003 and $3.6 billion announced during fiscal 2002. Primary contributors to Global Commercials European fiscal 2004 revenue growth of 7.4% on a constant currency basis included the following outsourcing contracts: Royal Mail Group, Bombardier Transportation, Marconi, SAS Group, ISS and National Grid Transco. These six contracts combined for $479 million of new revenue. Softness in demand for consulting and systems integration work, particularly in Germany, France and Italy, partially offset the outsourcing increases, resulting in the overall European revenue increase. U.S. commercial operations benefited during fiscal 2004 from growth on new and existing outsourcing contracts, including Motorola, Bombardier Transportation, General Dynamics, Dun & Bradstreet, British Telecom North America, Ascension Health and Providian, which combined for $238 million in fiscal 2004 revenue growth. Offsetting these improvements was the significantly reduced scope on the renewal of one engagement for which CSC was previously the primary outsourcing provider and is now a subcontractor, resulting in a $137 million decline. In addition, two outsourcing contracts that substantially ended in fiscal 2003 resulted in a $101 million decline year over year. The net effect of the new business and other growth, offset by the various declines, resulted in an overall decline of 4.6% for the U.S. commercial operations in fiscal 2004. An 8.3% constant currency revenue decline in Other International fiscal 2004 revenues was driven by a drop in Australian outsourcing revenues plus weaker third party product sales in Australia and Asia. A product reseller business in Australia was subsequently closed during fiscal 2005. U.S. Federal The Companys U.S. Federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources: Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount Department of Defense $ 2,909.8 (3.0 )% $ 2,999.2 62.3 % $ 1,848.0 Civil agencies 1,612.9 (10.6 ) 1,803.2 40.8 1,281.0 Other(1) 153.2 (15.2 ) 180.7 13.2 159.6 Total U.S. Federal sector $ 4,675.9 (6.2 ) $ 4,983.1 51.5 $ 3,288.6 (1) Other revenues consist of state and local government as well as commercial contracts performed by the U.S. Federal Sector reporting segment. 19 U.S Federal sector revenue for fiscal 2005 of $4,675.9 million was down $307 million or 6.2%. The revenue decline was driven by the completion, reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant programs, with a total impact of approximately $446 million. This impact, as well as that of other routine completions and volume reductions, was partially offset by program commencements and increased tasking on other programs. During fiscal 2005 CSC announced $7.0 billion of new U.S. Federal contract awards, versus $5.0 billion for fiscal 2004 and $2.7 billion for fiscal 2003. Department of Defense revenue was down $89 million or 3.0% for fiscal 2005. The completion of and reduced efforts on several logistics contracts for the U.S. Army as well as the de consolidation of a previously consolidated joint venture due to decreased CSC ownership accounted for approximately $270 million of revenue reduction. Partially offsetting these reductions were new contracts for equipment procurement and installation for the U.S. Army and I/T engineering and management efforts for the intelligence services, new tasking from the Navy for computing equipment support, and a new contract to provide flight simulators to the U.S. Army. These increases totaled approximately $230 million. The net impact of other normal contract activities start ups, completions, increased and decreased volumes accounted for the remaining change in revenue. Civil agencies revenue was down $190 million or 10.6% versus fiscal 2004, driven by the completion of significant projects with NASA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The impact of these completions was approximately $176 million. Scope reductions on other programs were partially offset by revenue from new contracts, including a program with the Department of Health and Human Services. Work performed by the U.S. Federal sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was $153 million for fiscal 2005, down $28 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in development work on a contract with the New York Department of Health as the development stage of the contract winds down. The Company has identified $15.8 billion of Federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal 2006 which the Company expects to pursue, plus an additional $17.2 billion during fiscal 2007. The Company expects to win a proportionate share of the awards. DynCorp operations acquired late in fiscal 2003, excluding units divested during fiscal 2005, accounted for substantially all of the fiscal 2004 revenue growth of 51.5% in the U.S. Federal sector. Excluding DynCorp, revenues from other Federal sector operations increased slightly during fiscal 2004, primarily from Department of Defense contracts, most notably missile defense, a U.S. Navy multiple awards contract, and several intelligence contracts, all of which combined for approximately $111 million in additional revenue. Offsetting this growth was reduced level of effort on a logistics contract with the Army, due to completion of the initial phase of the core project, and the de consolidation of a joint venture due to a reorganization that resulted in minority ownership for CSC. These two contracts accounted for a $66 million decline for the year. Revenue from Civil agencies, excluding DynCorp, was down for the year, driven mainly by decreases on contracts with the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education and NASA, which accounted for $57 million in reduced revenues. 20 Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Dollar Amount Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Costs of services $ 11,315.1 $ 10,828.2 $ 8,934.9 80.5 % 80.5 % 80.0 % Selling, general and administrative 807.8 793.7 699.5 5.7 5.9 6.3 Depreciation and amortization 1,051.0 966.0 799.7 7.5 7.2 7.2 Interest expense, net 140.7 160.6 134.3 1.0 1.2 1.2 Special items 28.6 22.7 1.3 .2 .2 Total $ 13,343.2 $ 12,771.2 $ 10,569.7 94.9 % 95.0 % 94.7 % Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2005 of 94.9% were in line with fiscal 2004 levels, with certain identifiable variance factors generally offsetting. The depreciation and amortization ratio was up somewhat, driven by fixed asset investments in the U.S. Federal sector and an unfavorable mix variance resulting from Global Commercial operations increasing as a percent of CSCs total. This increase was offset by a decrease in the interest expense ratio. Special items were flat as a percent of revenue for the two years. The Company substantially matches revenues and costs in the same currency. Therefore, the foreign currency impact of 2.7% for the year on fiscal 2005 revenues and costs did not have a material impact on costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue. However, the Company is increasing its use of off shore support and therefore may be exposed to additional margin fluctuations. Changes to the various cost and expense ratio percentages for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 were primarily due to the March 2003 DynCorp acquisition, excluding the subsequently divested international and other operations. With generally more labor intensive operations, the acquired DynCorp business had higher costs of services (COS) as a percentage of revenue and lower ratios for selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as well as for depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense. In addition, the special items for fiscal 2004 and 2003 relate to the DynCorp acquisition. Excluding DynCorp operations, fiscal 2004 ratios for COS, SG&A and D&A would have been 79.1%, 6.3% and 8.2%, respectively. Fiscal 2003 ratios would have been 79.6%, 6.3%, and 7.4%, respectively, excluding the three weeks of DynCorp operations at the end of the year. Costs of Services Costs of services as a percentage of revenue were 80.5% for fiscal 2005, unchanged from fiscal 2004. The Global Commercial sector ratio was essentially unchanged, 77.1% vs. 77.2%, but had an approximately .2% favorable mix impact on the Companys composite ratio due to the increase in Global Commercial operations as a percentage of the total. With a higher proportion of infrastructure services and a broader service offering, the Global Commercial sector cost base has relatively more depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses and less labor and other cost of services than the U.S. Federal sector. The Global Commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal 2005 benefited from certain revenue items, including the recognition of deferred revenue related to a renegotiated contract, client settlement payments and gains on the sale of minor, non core businesses. These had an approximately ..4% favorable impact on the ratio. The ratio also included the adverse impact of costs related to facility consolidations in our U.S. consulting operations, certain asset write downs to net realizable value, and the cost of closure for our Australian product reseller business. These factors had an adverse impact of approximately .3% on the cost of services ratio. 21 U.S. Federal sector cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased approximately .8%. Current year factors include the recognition of costs on certain programs for which recoverability has been determined to not be probable, contributing approximately .6%. The year over year comparison is also adversely impacted by approximately .3% by favorable adjustments during fiscal 2004, as previously disclosed, resulting from normal program reviews on long term projects. Cost of services amounts carried at the Corporate level include $24 million of accrued cost related to the settlement of an overtime pay class action lawsuit. These costs have not been allocated to the Companys segments as individual settlement recipients have yet to be identified. Costs of services as a percentage of revenue improved slightly to 79.1% for fiscal 2004 from 79.6% for fiscal 2003, when excluding the effect of the acquired DynCorp operations, which had a COS ratio of 89.9%. The improvement was driven primarily by other U.S. Federal sector operations, which posted a decrease to the COS ratio of 2.7% points, partly offset by a .6% point ratio increase in Global Commercial operations. U.S. Federal sector results included adjustments from normal program reviews in fiscal 2004 and 2003 that resulted in a net year over year increase to profitability on long term contracts, as well as from the final settlement for modifications to a fixed price contract. The Global Commercial ..6% point increase was driven by lower staff utilization in Europe, primarily Germany, France and Italy, due to soft demand for consulting and systems integration project work. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses improved as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2005 to 5.7%, from 5.9% for fiscal 2004. Improvement was seen in both of CSCs segments. The U.S. Federal sector contributed approximately two thirds of the improvement, driven by reduced bid and proposal costs as a percentage of revenue as well as executive and administrative staff and other cost reductions. Global Commercial ratio improvement was the result of leveraging existing levels of staff and systems to support the higher revenue level, particularly in U.S. outsourcing operations. Selling, general and administrative expenses were unchanged at 6.3% of revenues for fiscal 2004, excluding the impact of DynCorp operations which had a 3.6% SG&A ratio for fiscal 2004. An increase in the ratio for other U.S. Federal operations of .7% point was offset by a decrease in Global Commercial ratio of .2%. Increased investment in business development activities in U.S. Federal sector was the primary cause for the slight increase there, in addition to somewhat higher insurance and other costs. Contributing about equally to the Global Commercial ratio improvement were a reduced need for provisions for doubtful accounts and other cost improvements, the latter primarily in outsourcing operations. The provision for doubtful accounts benefited from the Companys long term client relationships, generally high client credit quality, and a lack of charges seen in prior years related to weakness in the high technology and telecommunications markets. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense of $1,051 million for fiscal 2005 represents 7.5% of revenue, up from 7.2% for fiscal 2004. An increase in the ratio for the U.S. Federal sector and an unfavorable mix variance more than offset slight improvement in the Global Commercial segment. The U.S. Federal sector increase, accounting for approximately .2% of the Companys ratio increase, is most significantly attributable to fixed asset investments on a large infrastructure outsourcing contract. The unfavorable mix variance, also contributing .2% of the ratio rise, is the result of the increasing Global Commercial activities share of the total. Global Commercial operations, with a higher proportion of infrastructure related services, have a higher ratio of depreciation and amortization expense to revenue. The mix impact was offset somewhat, and the Global Commercial ratio decreased slightly for fiscal 2005, due to new outsourcing accounts, particularly in the U.S., having lower depreciation and amortization than 22 the existing composite business. This is primarily attributable to certain new clients for which CSC did not purchase the existing asset inventory, but will be responsible for asset replacement. Therefore, the depreciation ratio on those accounts can be expected to rise over time. Excluding the DynCorp operations, which had only a 1.0% D&A ratio, the Companys ratio for fiscal 2004 increased to 8.2% of revenues versus 7.4% in the prior year. Increases at other U.S. Federal operations were a primary cause of the overall increase, and were mainly due to internal software and computer equipment additions that were made during fiscal 2004 to accommodate the increased demands from the DynCorp operations. The Global Commercial D&A ratio was basically unchanged from the 2003 level. Interest Expense The decrease in interest expense, net of interest income, for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due to lower average debt levels and an increase in interest income. The generation of cash flow, which limited the need to issue commercial paper, and the retirement of $1 billion of term debt during March 2005 combined to reduce interest expense by $13.0 million. In addition, interest income, including income from the invested proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International, increased approximately $6.9 million for fiscal 2005 resulting in a .2% improvement in the net interest expense ratio. The increase in interest expense, net of interest income, for fiscal 2004 verses fiscal 2003 is primarily attributable to additional borrowings, driven in part by the DynCorp acquisition. As a percentage of revenues, net interest improved slightly for fiscal 2004. Special Items During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company recorded a charge of $29.5 million for premium payments and the write down of deferred financing costs and interest discount related to the early redemption of $1 billion of term debt. The Company elected to make this early redemption and incur the charges as it had available cash and these debt issues carried interest rates above current prevailing rates. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further description. The debt redemption charge was partially offset by the reversal in the fourth quarter of previously recorded facility restructuring accruals of $.9 million. The combined special items had a $0.10 per share impact on earnings per share and a .2% net impact on the Companys profit margin in fiscal 2005. CSCs net profit margin for fiscal 2004 was reduced .2% for charges associated with the Special Item related to the DynCorp acquisition. The charges relate to exit or disposal activities of legacy CSC operations as a result of an assessment of requirements for the combined CSC DynCorp organization. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further description. Charges related to this Special Item were booked during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and had an $0.08 per share impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2004. The impact to fiscal 2003 margins was insignificant. Taxes The provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was 30.6%, 29.6% and 27.7% for fiscal 2005, fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of increased profits and the decreasing impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences that do not vary directly with increased profits. The continuation of this trend is expected to increase the Companys effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal 2006. The increases in pretax income in fiscal 2005 and 2004 resulted in a $18.5 million and $36.4 million increase in taxes for fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes. 23 Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $313.8 million including the gain noted below, $43.2 million and $11.7 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003. Income from discontinued operations during fiscal 2005 includes the net after tax gain on the sale of DynCorp International of $228.8 million or approximately $1.19 per share. Proceeds from the sale included $775 million of cash and $75 million of paid in kind preferred shares. Discontinued operations includes the operations of DynCorp International, sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and the operations of Health Plan Solutions which is classified as held for sale as of April 1, 2005 and has been sold subsequent to year end. The gain is subject to the finalization of working capital adjustments which are payable in paid in kind preferred shares. These working capital adjustments are subject to final agreement of the parties or arbitration and combined with the Health Plan Solutions exchange will result in a gain during fiscal 2006. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash Flows Dollars in millions Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Fiscal 2003 Net cash from operations $ 1,941.5 $ 1,677.5 $ 1,148.2 Net cash used in investing (595.4 ) (1,325.3 ) (994.0 ) Net cash used in financing (900.6 ) (84.0 ) (20.2 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 2.0 (5.0 ) 16.5 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 447.5 263.2 150.5 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 562.8 299.6 149.1 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,010.3 $ 562.8 $ 299.6 Historically, the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents have been provided from operating activities. Operating activities for fiscal 2005 generated $1.9 billion in net cash, up from $1.7 billion generated for fiscal 2004. Higher net earnings, coupled with higher levels of accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue, drove the increase in operating cash. In addition, higher non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and an increase in deferred revenue as a result of prepayments from customers for services and up front payments for contract start up and transition activities contributed to the increase in cash generated from operating activities. These payments are subject to contract terms and can be expected to fluctuate as contracts within the Companys portfolio commence, move beyond start up phases, and are completed. Partially offsetting these inflows was an increase in prepaid expenses as the result of increases in work in process and deferred costs related to expected contract modifications with the U.S. Federal government, and an increase in receivables due to the growth in revenue. The increase in receivables was driven by the increase in revenues, offsetting an improvement in year end DSO. Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2006 is expected to be impacted by an increase in the Companys investment in working capital, as the result of new business won during fiscal 2005, and an increase in the payment of income taxes during fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2004, net cash provided from operations increased to $1.7 billion from $1.1 billion as a result of higher net earnings, an increase in non cash expenses, an improvement in year end DSO and improved cash disbursements management. An increase in deferred revenue as the result of customer prepayments for services and upfront payments for contract start up and transition activities on certain contracts also contributed to the increase. Partially offsetting these inflows were investments in new outsourcing contracts. 24 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff indicated that auction rate securities should not be classified as cash equivalents unless, when purchased, the maturity of the underlying debt is less than 90 days. The Company had classified its occasional holdings of auction rate securities as cash equivalents regardless of the maturity of the underlying debt. As a result, the Company reclassified $46.9 million of auction rate securities held at April 2, 2004 from Cash and cash equivalents to available for sale investments. This reclassification had no impact on operating cash flows but did increase investing cash outflow during fiscal 2004 by $46.9 million and reduced investing cash outflow for fiscal 2005 by the corresponding amount. The Company had no auction rate securities as of the end of fiscal 2005. The Companys investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software, and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the Companys expanding Global Commercial operations. Investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades, expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets. For cash flow presentation purposes, the Outsourcing Contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contracts acquisition or start up, including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets (premium). Major new fiscal 2005 outsourcing contracts, including Zurich Financial Services and Ascension Health contracts and design and build contracts with the United Kingdoms National Health Service, drove much of the increased investments during the year. The new fiscal 2005 outsourcing contracts, as well as contractually driven equipment replacement requirements on existing contracts, are also expected to drive fiscal 2006 investing cash outflows. Significant capital expenditures and outsourcing contract costs are expected for engagements with United Technologies Corporation (UTC), Zurich Financial Services, BAE Systems PLC (BAE) and U.K. National Health Service and two U.S. Federal sector contracts (an Army aviation training contract and an intelligence services contract). Despite the anticipated investments on new contracts, investing cash outflows are expected to decrease slightly during fiscal 2006. Total operating cash inflows are expected to more than cover total investing outflows for fiscal 2006. The Companys investments also include acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, including significant amounts for fiscal 2003 related to the acquisition of DynCorp. While increasing new business will typically generate higher overall capital investments, the mix of the new business will impact the level of capital per contract. The growth in U.S. Federal awards during fiscal 2005 and the expected growth in consulting and systems integration work is expected to limit the growth in overall capital investment in fiscal 2006 as U.S. Federal contracts and consulting and systems integration projects typically require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial outsourcing contracts. This coupled with the Companys continued focus on improving cash flows and return on investment is expected to result in a decrease in cash outflow from investing activities for fiscal 2006. Dispositions of investments in businesses have from time to time generated investing cash flows for the Company. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the disposition of DynCorp International generated $775 million in cash proceeds. As discussed below the Company used these proceeds to reduce debt levels during that quarter. As described above, historically a majority of the Companys capital investments have been funded by cash from operations. Net cash outflows from financing activities over the past three years reflect the Companys commitment to reduce its overall debt levels and improve its debt to total capitalization ratio. Continuing this commitment to reduce debt levels the Company utilized proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International to redeem $1.0 billion of term debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal 25 2005. This reduced the Companys overall year end debt level to its lowest level since fiscal 2000. Cash outflows to redeem the term debt included $27.8 million of early redemption premiums. At year end fiscal 2005, there was no outstanding commercial paper, a result of cash generated from operations. Partially offsetting the financing cash out flows from debt redemption and repayment of borrowings were cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options. During fiscal 2004 the Company issued $300 million of 3.50% term debt due April 2008 with the proceeds used to reduce outstanding commercial paper and support general corporate purposes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 the Company issued 15 million shares to partially fund the DynCorp acquisition. In addition, the Company issued $300 million of 5.00% notes due February 15, 2013. The funds were used for general corporate purposes, including reduction of outstanding commercial paper which had increased as a result of paying off assumed DynCorp debt and the cash portion of the DynCorp consideration. Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,010.3 million at April 1, 2005, $562.8 million at April 2, 2004, and $299.6 million at March 28, 2003. During fiscal 2005, equity increased due to the Companys earnings as well as a foreign currency translation adjustment of $94.3 million, offset by an increase in unfunded pension obligations of $37.7 million. At the end of fiscal 2005, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 17.6%, down from 30.1% at the end of fiscal 2004 and 35.0% at the end of fiscal 2003. These debt ratio improvements were the result of debt reduction and equity increases during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. The Companys debt to total capitalization ratio of 17.6% as of the end of fiscal 2005 is low compared to the Companys ratios during the last five years. However, the ratio may rise in the future if the Company identifies suitable investment opportunities or other significant capital requirements. Dollars in millions 2005 2004 2003 Debt $ 1,388.7 $ 2,366.5 $ 2,479.3 Equity 6,494.7 5,503.7 4,606.4 Total capitalization $ 7,883.4 $ 7,870.2 $ 7,085.7 Debt to total capitalization 17.6 % 30.1 % 35.0 % The Companys sources of liquidity include cash, commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. Short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements. Forecasted positive cash flows are expected to limit the need for short term borrowings during fiscal 2006. At April 1, 2005, the Company had a committed line of credit providing $700 million of long term commercial paper backup which expires on August 13, 2009. If the Company were unable to sell its commercial paper, borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit, or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned, the Company has the ability to borrow under this committed line of credit. This line of credit has the option of being drawn at a Base Rate, a Eurodollar Rate or a bid option rate. The line requires the Company to (1) limit liens placed on our assets to $100 million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business; (2) maintain a not to exceed ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of .50 to 1.00; and (3) not permit on any date the ratio of consolidated total debt outstanding on such date to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date, to exceed 2.50 to 1.00. For further details on this agreement please see Exhibit 10.27, which is incorporated by reference to this Annual Report. As of April 1, 2005, the Company had no borrowings under these lines and was in compliance with all terms of the agreements. 26 At April 1, 2005, the Company had $78.4 million of short term borrowings and $1.3 billion of long term debt. As further described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the classification of the commercial paper is determined by the expiration date of its credit facility. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 1, 2005. In March 2005, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International and cash on hand to redeem the 7.5% term notes due August 2005, and the 6.75% term notes due June 2006 for $998.9 million, and early redemption premium of $27.8 million. In addition, during fiscal 2004, the Company issued $300 million of term debt from its fiscal 2002 shelf registration. On March 21, 2005, the Company instituted a voluntary share repurchase program for shareholders owning less than 100 shares. Under this program which has now expired, the Company repurchased 48,443 shares for $2.2 million on April 25, 2005 and 11,000 shares for $.5 million on May 31, 2005. The Companys short term commercial paper has ratings from Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch of A1, P2 and F1, respectively, and the Companys term debt has ratings from Standards & Poors, Moodys and Fitch of A, A3 and A, respectively. All of these credit ratings have stable outlooks. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of April 1, 2005: Dollars in millions Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 & thereafter Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 80.5 $ .1 $ 80.6 Letters of credit 67.4 1.0 $ 12.2 80.6 Standby letters of credit 219.6 .3 85.8 305.7 Foreign subsidiary debt guarantees 358.2 203.2 561.4 Total $ 725.7 $ 204.6 $ 98.0 $ 1,028.3 See Note 9 for a discussion of the above financial guarantees. The following table summarizes the Companys payments on contractual obligations by period as of April 1, 2005: Dollars in millions Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Long term debt $ 498.1 $ 794.7 $ 1,292.8 Interest on fixed rate debt $ 74.9 $ 149.8 117.1 89.8 431.6 Capital lease obligations 6.9 7.6 1.0 1.1 16.6 Bank debt 78.4 78.4 Operating leases 279.0 386.3 234.3 284.1 1,183.7 Minimum purchase obligations 715.8 959.0 429.1 322.1 2,426.0 Other long term liabilities .4 .3 .2 .9 Total $ 1,155.4 $ 1,503.0 $ 1,279.6 $ 1,492.0 $ 5,430.0 Regarding minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operations of business activities. The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified 27 service minimums, the Company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall. The above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company has numerous plans, both inside and outside of the U.S., and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis. The minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors, and can be $0 in some years. Funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including ERISA and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). While there are certain minimum contributions requirements, CSC may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments, changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts. During fiscal 2006, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $240 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal 2006 because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Fiscal 2005 contributions were $254.2 million. Of this amount $55 million was made toward the end of fiscal 2005 in order to increase non U.S. pension plans funded position. These fiscal year contribution figures may differ from those in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements due to the use of a December 31st measurement date in that note. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, cash balances, and unused short term borrowing capacity. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2002, the Company filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of debt and or equity securities. The Company has previously issued $600 million worth of term debt from the shelf registration, leaving $900 million of shelf available for additional securities. Dividends and Redemption It has been the Companys policy to invest earnings in the growth of the Company rather than distribute earnings as dividends. This policy, under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal 1969, is expected to continue, but is subject to regular review by the Board of Directors. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues. While changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements, the risk is mitigated by the Companys broad portfolio of contracts that would typically have offsetting adjustments. 28 The Company has identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. The Companys critical accounting estimates relate to: revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill; assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts While fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting currently comprise less than 7% of CSCs total revenue, the determination of revenues and costs on such contracts requires significant judgment and estimation. The method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the Companys software engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. Modifications to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, the Company may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. The Company routinely negotiates such contract modifications in both the U.S. Federal and Global Commercial sectors. Revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization If significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results. Capitalization of outsourcing contract costs Certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set up costs, and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets (premiums). Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that the Company must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the 29 recoverability of deferred costs. The Company utilizes the experience and knowledge of its professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion, to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of Company personnel. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues. Capitalization of software development costs The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. The Company considers various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of the Companys ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs, the Company must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to the Companys results of operations. Estimates used to determine deferred income taxes The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. The Company also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill The Company accounts for its acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value. Third party valuation firms may be used to appraise certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by the Company, such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company 30 professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired. As goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment. Such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values. Cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates, which involve the input of numerous Company professionals from finance, operations and program management. Key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. Significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities The Company offers a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. In making these assumptions, we are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan, the asset mix of the plan, historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors. The weighted average of the expected long term rates of return on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2005 pension plan valuations was 7.7% compared to 7.9% used in fiscal 2004. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the net periodic pension cost by approximately $10 million. An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of the Companys pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal 2005 pension plan valuations was 5.9% compared to 6.1% used for fiscal 2004. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have increased or decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately $36 million. Some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts. The accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year. Such differences 31 contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time. For CSC, negative financial market returns for fiscal 2003 resulted in lower than expected pension plan asset returns, while positive market returns for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected. Declining discount rates over the past several years, which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations, served to partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, respectively. SFAS No. 87 requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at the end of the year. At the end of both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, some of the Companys pension plans had ABOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, thus requiring additional minimum obligations. The excess at the end of fiscal 2005 was higher than at the end of fiscal 2004. As a result, the Company was required to adjust the additional minimum pension liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The effect of this adjustment was to increase the minimum pension liability by $60.8 million during fiscal 2005, decrease intangible assets by $2.8 million and record a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income of $63.6 million ($37.7 million net of taxes). Based on future plan asset performance and interest rates, additional changes to equity might be required. Assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, the Company accrues a liability in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results. 32 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS All statements and assumptions contained in this annual report and in the documents attached or incorporated by reference that do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements represent current expectations and beliefs of CSC, and no assurance can be given that the results described in such statements will be achieved. Forward looking information contained in these statements include, among other things, statements with respect to CSCs financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities, plans and objectives of management, and other matters. Such statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of CSCs control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in such statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: (i) changes in demand for information technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing and consulting and systems integration services; (ii) the Companys ability to continue to develop and expand its service offerings to address emerging business demands and technological trends; (iii) competitive pressures; (iv) the Companys ability to consummate divestitures, and to consummate and integrate acquisitions and form alliances; (v) early termination of customer contracts; (vi) the Companys ability to collect its accounts receivable on a timely basis; (vii) the Companys ability to recover its capital investment in outsourcing contracts; (viii) the profitability of long term customer contracts and fixed price customer contracts, and the Companys ability to negotiate appropriate contract modifications; (ix) the Companys exposure to financially troubled customers; (x) pending litigation; (xi) the Companys ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and (xii) general economic conditions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates in countries in which the Company does business. The Company is engaged in providing services under contracts with the U.S. Government. These contracts are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements and, from time to time, agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether the Companys operations are being conducted in accordance with these requirements. U.S. Government investigations of the Company, whether related to the Companys federal government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon the Company, or could lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracting. Forward looking statements in this Annual Report speak only as of the date of this Annual Report, and forward looking statement in documents attached or incorporated by reference speak only as to the date of those documents. CSC does not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward looking statement or to report any events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. 33 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows. Foreign Currency During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received. Short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. By generally matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. However, the Company is increasing its use of off shore support and is therefore becoming more exposed to currency fluctuations. If necessary, the Company may use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions. During fiscal 2005, 39.5% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 3.95% or $555.5 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 3.95% or $555.5 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by $31.9 million. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. At April 1, 2005, the Company had approximately $533.4 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $78.4 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 34
