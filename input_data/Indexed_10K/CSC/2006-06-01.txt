Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC or the Company). The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended March 31, 2006. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: to provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; to enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes, providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed; and to provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. To achieve these objectives, the discussion is presented in the following sections: Overview includes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash, as well as a discussion of the key business drivers, economic and industry factors, fiscal 2006 highlights and fiscal 2007 commentary. Results of Operations discusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal 2004 to 2006, describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reporting segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and currency impacts, and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories. Financial Condition discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the Companys liquidity position and available capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimates discusses accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. OVERVIEW The Companys primary service offerings are outsourcing and I/T and professional services. Outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customers technology infrastructure and applications, and business process outsourcing. I/T and professional services include systems integration, consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services. CSC provides these services to customers in the Global Commercial and U.S. federal government markets. On a geographic basis, CSC provides services to Global Commercial customers in the United States, Europe and other international locations. Operations in Australia, Asia and Canada generate substantially all revenue within Other International. Economic and Industry Factors Global Commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on I/T projects. CSC is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors, including service offerings and flexibility. Management monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. The U.S. federal market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract is terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed. Shifting priorities of 16 Table of Contents the U.S. government can also impact the future of projects. The Company recognized the U.S. governments increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development efforts in these areas. Management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts, legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations. Business Drivers Revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting from less than six months to 10 years or more. Factors affecting revenue include: the Companys ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards, the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes, the ability to compete on price, services offered, technical ability, experience and flexibility, the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues, the ability to successfully identify and divest non core operations which may impact revenue in the short term but provide resources to pursue longer term growth and value creation opportunities, and currency fluctuations related to international operations. Earnings are driven by the above revenue factors, in addition to the following: the ability to control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs, the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses, the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals, and the ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore. Cash flows are impacted by the above earnings factors, in addition to other factors including the following: timely management of receivables and payables, investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts, and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments. Key Performance Indicators The Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue growth, margins, cash flow and return on investment. New contract wins In addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the Companys ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous external factors. CSC employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts. Revenue growth Year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth. Margins Margins reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of acquisitions or dispositions of 17 Table of Contents business with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations. Cash flow Over time the primary drivers of the Companys cash flow are earnings provided by the Companys operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings. Also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances. The Company also regularly reviews the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements of operating, investing and financing cash flows, as well as non GAAP free cash flow. Return on investment (ROI) ROI is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization. A combination of strong margins (measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue) and investment base turnover (measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital) is required to generate sufficient returns on capital. Strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns. Readers should be cautioned that DSO, free cash flow and ROI are not GAAP measures, and the Companys definition of such measures may differ from other companies. Therefore, such measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. CSC calculates DSO as follows: Total receivables at quarter end divided by revenue per day. Revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the fiscal quarter. Free cash flow is equal to the sum of 1) operating cash flows, 2) investing cash flows, excluding business acquisitions and dispositions, purchase or sale of available for sale securities and 3) capital lease payments. ROI is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover. The profit margin used is profit before interest and special items and after tax divided by revenues. Investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity. Fiscal 2006 Highlights Significant events during fiscal 2006 include: Revenues rose 4.0%, approximately 4.8% before currency fluctuations. Income from continuing operations grew 16.2%. Continuing earnings per share, after special charges, were up 18.5%. The special charge of 26 cents per share adversely impacted continuing earnings per share compared to prior year by 6.2%. Announced contract awards of $12.1 billion with new U.S. Federal awards of $7.1 billion, and new Global Commercial awards totaling $5.0 billion. Free cash flow of $463 million declined $31 million from $494 million in fiscal 2005. (1) (1) The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measure: Fiscal Year Ended (in millions) March 31, 2006 April 1, 2005 April 2, 2004 Free cash flow $ 462.9 $ 493.9 $ 363.8 Net cash used in investing activities 1,124.0 595.4 1,325.3 Acquisition, net of cash acquired (44.1 ) (20.5 ) Business dispositions .5 819.1 10.0 Capital lease payments 8.0 6.7 25.3 Available for sale securities (See Note 1) 46.9 (46.9 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,551.3 $ 1,941.5 $ 1,677.5 Capital lease payments and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment (included in investing activities) are included in the calculation of free cash flow. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with this presentation. 18 Table of Contents DSO was 88 days at year end versus 83 days at the end of the prior year. Debt to total capitalization ratio was 17.8% at year end, consistent with prior year ratio. ROI from continuing operations was 9.0% for the year a .8% point improvement from prior year. The exchange of the Companys Health Plan Solutions unit for 7.13 million shares of the Companys stock held by a subsidiary of DST Systems Inc. and the subsequent recognition of a $22.9 million gain from the exchange in April 2005. The Company expects the gain to be exempt from income tax. Gain from the working capital adjustment settlement for the sale of DynCorp International of $38.4 million, after tax. The Companys significant wins in fiscal 2006 included the following: Global Commercial: Dupont ($1.9 billion), BAE Systems ($1.9 billion), General Dynamics ($260 million), Schroders ($235 million), U.S. Federal: U.S. Army ($1.5 billion), Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ($384 million), U.S. Air Force 45th Space Wing ($335 million), U.S. Air Force Air Education Training Command ($307 million), Department of Defense Missile Defense Agency ($243 million), and NASA Shared Services Center ($230 million). These multi year awards represent the estimated value of the Companys portion at contract signing. They cannot be considered firm orders, however, due to their variable attributes, including demand driven usage, modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements, annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the Companys U.S. Federal activities. Revenue growth in the Global Commercial sector was the result of recent years significant contract wins. U.S. Federal sector wins have also been strong, particularly in the Department of Defense service area. Currency shifts during the year unfavorably impacted revenue. The Companys growth has created a broad, long term global revenue base across numerous customers, industries, geographic regions and service offerings. Approximately 80% of CSCs revenues come from long term contracts including Global Commercial outsourcing and U.S. federal government engagements. An increase in investment in working capital as the result of contracts awarded during fiscal 2005 reduced cash flow from operations during fiscal 2006. These increases in working capital were anticipated and were financed from current cash flows enabling the Company to maintain the debt to capitalization ratio at the reduced levels achieved in fiscal 2005. Cash out flow for investing activities, adjusted for the disposition of DynCorp International, declined from prior year as a result of lower levels of investment in outsourcing contracts, equipment and software. Fiscal 2007 Commentary As a leading federal contractor and one of the top I/T service providers to the U.S. federal government, CSCs U.S. Federal sector is well positioned to benefit from anticipated growing demand. The U.S. federal 19 Table of Contents government is one of the worlds largest I/T services consumers, and its spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense, homeland security and civil agency modernization. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds and project assignments can vary, the Company expects its broad I/T and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government. The Companys major pursuits in the global commercial market during fiscal 2006 focused on the renewal and extension of major global outsourcing contracts with such efforts rewarded by the DuPont and BAE Systems awards as well as Schroders, British Nuclear Group and General Dynamics extensions or expansions noted above. In addition, the Company has been and will continue to be selective in new business pursuit opportunities given the focus on margin expansion and increasing return on investment. With respect to discretionary spending and project work, Central and Southern Europe continue to show areas of soft demand while North American demand for consulting and systems integration is strengthening, although price pressures continue. While the future demand for outsourcing services is not known with certainty, the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows CSC to benefit from a certain level of continuity. Growth during fiscal 2007 in Global Commercial revenue from new business awarded during fiscal 2006 and 2005 is expected to be tempered by the termination or reduction in scope of a few significant outsourcing engagements and reduced rates of recovery on renewed engagements. During fiscal 2006, the Companys Global Commercial segments revenue was unfavorably impacted by currency fluctuations in Europe and Other International regions. The Company cannot forecast with certainty future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results. Other trends the Company expects for fiscal 2007 are as follows: In Europe significant outsourcing wins in fiscal 2005 generated revenue growth in outsourcing during fiscal 2006. Revenue growth from these engagements may slow as these engagements mature and billing rates are adjusted to industry benchmarks. The impact of rising demand for utilization of offshore capabilities on current and future engagements will also impact the pace of future revenue growth in Europe. The Company has identified $23.1 billion of Federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal 2007 which the Company expects to pursue, plus an additional $14.3 billion during fiscal 2008. The Company expects to win a share of the awards. The Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R), Share Based Payment, during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Expensing of employee stock options and awards is expected to result in the recognition of approximately $65 million of pre tax expense, three quarters of which is projected to be in selling, general and administrative expense and the balance in costs of services. The $65 million is an estimate, as the actual amount is subject to the number of options granted and changes in the share price of CSC. The fiscal 2007 estimate is approximately $55 million pre tax higher than amounts recorded in fiscal 2006 under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue for the U.S. Federal sector is expected to rise as contracts with the U.S. Army and other agencies with significant capital content come on line. The decreased impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences is expected to increase the Companys effective tax rate on continuing operations for fiscal 2007. Cash flow from operations for fiscal 2007, including the impact of the restructuring plan announced in April 2006, is expected to decline slightly from the $1,551 million for fiscal 2006. Outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal 2006 and 2005, as well as contractually driven equipment replacement requirements on existing contracts, are expected to drive fiscal 2007 investing cash outflows. Significant investing outflows are expected for engagements to provide commercial outsourcing infrastructure. Despite the anticipated investments for outsourcing engagements, investing cash outflows are expected to decrease slightly during fiscal 2007. Total operating cash inflows are expected to more than cover total investing outflows for fiscal 2007. 20 Table of Contents The Companys overall short term financial objectives include: 1. Successfully launch the new contracts won during fiscal 2006. 2. Effectively manage working capital and capital investment. 3. Maintain appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins, with particular emphasis on the new business, in order to improve return on investment. 4. Pursue the current pipeline of commercial and U.S. Federal opportunities and win a proportionate share. 5. Manage the announced restructuring plan (see discussion below) to achieve the expected results. The Companys primary long term objective is to continue developing and obtaining the core capabilities and differentiating factors that will enable CSC to compete effectively in both the Federal and Global Commercial markets. The Company will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that enhance its core capabilities and review its portfolio of business operations for overall strategic fit. Continued long term revenue and earnings growth will come from the combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Subsequent to fiscal 2006 year end, the Company announced a response to recent expressions of interest, and stated that CSCs Board of Directors has decided to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value, including a potential sale of the Company. There can be no assurance the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction, and the Company does not intend to disclose developments regarding its exploration unless and until the Board of Directors has reached a conclusion. During the period in which uncertainty exists as to the future direction the Company takes, demand for the Companys services could be adversely impacted. In April 2006, the Company announced a restructuring plan which will be carried out during fiscal 2007 and 2008. The objectives of the plan are to 1) streamline CSCs worldwide operation and 2) leverage the increased use of lower cost resources. Workforce reductions of approximately 4,300 and 700 employees are planned for fiscal 2007 and 2008, respectively, which will result in associated estimated pre tax restructuring charges of $375 million. Restructuring charges will consist predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations. In addition, the Company will evaluate facility requirements as a result of the headcount reductions and certain charges could occur from early lease cancellations or ceasing use of facility space. A majority of the planned workforce reductions (2,600 in fiscal 2007 and 50 in 2008) will take place in Europe. Approximately 1,300 and 500 heads will be reduced in North America in fiscal 2007 and 2008, respectively, with the balance in Australia and Asia. Partially offsetting the reductions will be headcount increases in certain lower cost regions of approximately 1,600 and 400 employees in fiscal 2007 and 2008, respectively. As a result of the restructuring, the Company expects total pre tax savings of approximately $150 million in fiscal 2007 and $300 million in fiscal 2008, net of the new costs from headcount increases in the lower cost regions. While the impact on specific cost elements cannot yet be determined, future costs of services and selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to represent a lower percentage of revenues as a result of the overall lower cost structure. 21 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues for the Global Commercial and U.S. Federal sector segments (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 are as follows: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Dollars in millions Amount PercentChange Amount PercentChange Amount U.S. Commercial $ 4,024.3 5.1 % $ 3,829.7 7.2 % $ 3,572.0 Europe 4,176.8 (3.4 ) 4,325.7 17.5 3,681.8 Other International 1,360.5 10.9 1,227.3 1.4 1,210.8 Global Commercial sector 9,561.6 1.9 9,382.7 10.8 8,464.6 U.S. Federal sector 5,054.0 8.1 4,675.9 (6.2 ) 4,983.1 Corporate .2 Total $ 14,615.6 4.0 $ 14,058.6 4.5 $ 13,447.9 The major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows: Fiscal 2006 vs. Fiscal 2005 Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total U.S. Commercial 5.1 % 5.1 % Europe (3.5 )% .1 (3.4 ) Other International 2.5 8.4 10.9 Global Commercial sector (1.3 ) 3.2 1.9 U.S. Federal sector 8.1 8.1 Corporate Total (.8 ) 4.8 4.0 Fiscal 2005 vs. Fiscal 2004 Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total U.S. Commercial 7.2 % 7.2 % Europe 8.5 % 9.0 17.5 Other International 5.0 (3.6 ) 1.4 Global Commercial sector 4.4 6.4 10.8 U.S. Federal sector (6.2 ) (6.2 ) Corporate Total 2.7 1.8 4.5 Fiscal 2006 revenue growth from significant new commercial engagements and Federal programs offset the impact of 1) terminated commercial contracts with Nortel Networks and JPMorgan Chase, 2) revised billing rates for extended contracts, 3) reduced scope on certain Federal programs and 4) wind down of the development phase on a significant government project. Global Commercial growth for fiscal 2006 of 1.9% (3.2% in constant currency) was led by U.S. Commercial operations where new outsourcing engagements, growth on existing outsourcing engagements and growth in the U.S. consulting and systems integration business offset terminated engagements and lower billing rates on extended engagements. Other International operations benefited from growth on existing business. Europe operations, in constant currency, were unchanged from the prior year. The U.S. Federal sector revenue growth benefited from contracts awarded during fiscal 2006 and 2005 and from growth on existing programs offsetting the effects of programs with reduced scopes as noted above. For fiscal 2005 revenue performance versus fiscal 2004, the impact of significant new commercial engagements offset the impact of the completion, reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of 22 Table of Contents significant Federal programs. Global Commercial growth for fiscal 2005 of 10.8% (6.4% in constant currency) was led by the European region, where new outsourcing engagements offset continued weak demand for consulting and systems integration. U.S. operations also benefited from major contract wins but additionally saw modest growth in consulting and systems integration revenue. In the U.S. Federal sector, the impact of $7.0 billion of announced contract awards did not offset revenue declines on certain programs, and fiscal 2005 revenue declined 6.2% to $4.7 billion. Global Commercial Revenue from Global Commercial grew 1.9%, 3.2% in constant currency, during fiscal 2006. New major engagements contributed approximately $483 million to Global Commercials revenue growth for fiscal 2006. These engagements, although primarily for outsourcing services, include other I/T and professional services. Revenue from existing engagements declined for fiscal 2006 as growth in U.S. consulting and systems integration services and in Other International was offset by lower billing rates on a contract extension, reduced volume on certain contracts, the termination and wind down of certain contracts such as Nortel Networks, Sears, and JPMorgan Chase and a decline in software license sales. U.S. Commercial revenues increased $195 million for fiscal 2006, or 5.1%. The growth was primarily from outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal 2005 and growth in the consulting and systems integration business. New contracts contributing to the growth were Sun, Ascension Health, Textron and Aon when combined, contributed $279 million to revenue growth for fiscal 2006. This revenue growth and the contribution from U.S. consulting and systems integration were partially offset by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain significant outsourcing contracts and the termination of significant outsourcing contracts with Nortel Networks and JPMorgan Chase. The Companys contract with Sears, Roebuck & Co. for outsourcing services, which was terminated during fiscal 2006, provided $131 million of revenue during fiscal 2006. Other International revenues increased $133 million or 10.9%, 8.4% in constant currency, during fiscal 2006. Australian operations contributed $62 million of revenue growth attributable to a professional staffing business and a major outsourcing contract, offset somewhat by the termination of an outsourcing contract. Asia contributed $50 million in revenue growth attributable to various outsourcing engagements. Europe revenues decreased $149 million or 3.4% though were essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis. Growth from new outsourcing and I/T and professional services engagements with U.K. National Health Service, Zurich Financial Services and Renault of $184 million was offset by unfavorable currency movements of approximately $152 million, reduced scope of work on certain outsourcing engagements, reduced billing rates on a contract extension, a decline in software license sales and continued softness in demand for the Companys consulting and systems integration services in Germany and Italy. Global Commercial revenue growth was 10.8% for fiscal 2005, or 6.4% in constant currency. New major engagements were the Companys significant driver of Global Commercial revenue growth, contributing approximately $854 million of fiscal 2005 revenue. These engagements encompass both outsourcing and other I/T and professional services. Announced commercial contract wins totaled $9.0 billion for fiscal 2005 and $9.7 billion for fiscal 2004. Existing base revenues declined somewhat for fiscal 2005, due to normal contract completions and declines as productivity increases are reflected in declining bill rates to clients. Europe revenues increased $644 million for fiscal 2005, representing 17.5% growth, 9.0% in constant currency. Major new engagements contributing to this performance included the U.K. National Health Service and the European operations of Zurich Financial Services, as well as the full year impact of the fiscal 2004 SAS Group and National Grid Transco contract commencements. Revenue growth attributable to these new engagements of approximately $572 million and favorable currency movement of approximately $310 million were offset by continued weakness in demand for the Companys consulting and systems integration services in Continental Europe as well as reduced scope on certain existing outsourcing engagements. 23 Table of Contents U.S. commercial revenue increased by $258 million or 7.2% for fiscal 2005. This growth is primarily attributable to new fiscal 2005 and 2004 outsourcing contracts with the U.S. operations of Zurich Financial Services, Aon, Ascension Health, Textron and Motorola, with total fiscal 2005 revenue growth impact of approximately $221 million. This impact and slight growth in the Companys U.S. consulting and systems integration business were offset somewhat by reduced volumes and billing rates on certain major outsourcing contracts. Other International revenues were up $16.5 million from fiscal 2004, though down 3.6% in constant currency, primarily the result of reduced product sales, including the closure of a product reseller business in Australia. These reductions were offset somewhat by increased outsourcing revenues including the full year effect from the Companys engagement with Malayan Banking Berhad. U.S. Federal The Companys U.S. Federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources: Fiscal 2006 Fiscal 2005 Fiscal 2004 Dollars in millions Amount PercentChange Amount PercentChange Amount Department of Defense $ 3,368.9 15.8 % $ 2,909.8 (3.0 )% $ 2,999.2 Civil agencies 1,544.3 (4.3 ) 1,612.9 (10.6 ) 1,803.2 Other (1) 140.8 (8.1 ) 153.2 (15.2 ) 180.7 Total U.S. Federal sector $ 5,054.0 8.1 $ 4,675.9 (6.2 ) $ 4,983.1 (1) Other revenues consist of state and local government as well as commercial contracts performed by the U.S. Federal sector segment. U.S Federal sector revenue growth for fiscal 2006 was 8.1% with revenue up $378 million to $5,054 million. The revenue growth was driven by new business awarded during fiscal 2006 and 2005 and increases on existing Department of Defense contracts. This growth was partially offset by the completion of the development phase on a state contract and reduced scope on a small number of significant programs. The U.S. Federal sector continued to win significant new business during fiscal 2006 with announced new U.S. federal contract awards of $7.1 billion versus $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005 and $5.0 billion for fiscal 2004. Department of Defense revenue increased $459 million or 15.8% to $3,369 million for fiscal 2006. Growth was the result of increased demand for equipment procurement and installation services for the U.S. Army, a new program to provide aviation support services, new tasking on programs to provide logistical support to the U.S. Army, new tasking to provide technical support for the Navys undersea test facilities, a multiple award contract to provide professional services to Naval Sea Systems Command, a new program to provide support services for the U.S. Strategic Command and I/T engineering and management services for certain intelligence services. These new programs and tasking provided approximately $297 million in revenue growth for fiscal 2006. The remainder of the revenue increase during fiscal 2006 was the result of normal contract activities including new tasking on various projects and various new programs. Civil agencies revenue was down $69 million or 4.3% versus fiscal 2005, driven by the reduction in scope for a significant project with the Internal Revenue Service. The impact of the scope reduction on this project was approximately $72 million. New tasking on projects for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) offset scope reductions and the completion of other programs. Work performed by the U.S. Federal sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was $141 million for fiscal 2006, down $12 million. The decrease was the result, primarily, of a reduction of effort on a contract with the New York Department of Health. This was offset somewhat by a project with a foreign government to provide information technology services. 24 Table of Contents U.S Federal sector revenue for fiscal 2005 of $4,675.9 million was down $307 million or 6.2% compared to fiscal 2004. The revenue decline was driven by the completion, reduced scope or de consolidation of a small number of significant programs, with a total impact of approximately $446 million. This impact, as well as that of other routine completions and volume reductions, was partially offset by program commencements and increased tasking on other programs. Department of Defense revenue was down $89 million or 3.0% for fiscal 2005. The completion of and reduced efforts on several logistics contracts for the U.S. Army as well as the de consolidation of a previously consolidated joint venture due to decreased CSC ownership accounted for approximately $270 million of revenue reduction. Partially offsetting these reductions were new contracts for equipment procurement and installation for the U.S. Army and I/T engineering and management efforts for the intelligence services, new tasking from the Navy for computing equipment support, and a new contract to provide flight simulators to the U.S. Army. These increases totaled approximately $230 million. The net impact of other normal contract activities start ups, completions, increased and decreased volumes accounted for the remaining change in revenue. Civil agencies revenue was down $190 million or 10.6% versus fiscal 2004, driven by the completion of significant projects with NASA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The impact of these completions was approximately $176 million. Scope reductions on other programs were partially offset by revenue from new contracts, including a program with the Department of Health and Human Services. Work performed by the U.S. Federal sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was $153 million for fiscal 2005, down $28 million. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in development work on a contract with the New York Department of Health as the development stage of the contract winds down. Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Dollar Amount Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Costs of services $ 11,719.8 $ 11,315.1 $ 10,828.2 80.2 % 80.5 % 80.5 % Selling, general and administrative 842.2 807.8 793.7 5.8 5.7 5.9 Depreciation and amortization 1,091.8 1,051.0 966.0 7.5 7.5 7.2 Interest expense, net 63.4 140.7 160.6 .4 1.0 1.2 Special items 77.3 28.6 22.7 .5 .2 .2 Total $ 13,794.5 $ 13,343.2 $ 12,771.2 94.4 % 94.9 % 95.0 % Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2006 improved .5% points to 94.4% from 94.9% for fiscal 2005 with most ratios improved or unchanged from the prior year. The cost of services ratio decreased as a result of cost management and revenue settlements for which the associated costs were recorded in a prior period. The interest expense ratio decreased primarily as the result of the retirement of $1 billion of term debt during March 2005. These decreases were offset by the impairment charge and loss on sale of equipment due to the termination of portions of the Nortel Networks contract recorded as a special item in fiscal 2006. The Company substantially matches revenues and costs in the same currency. Therefore, foreign currency did not have a material impact on costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue. However, the Company is increasing its use of offshore support and therefore may be exposed to additional margin fluctuations. Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2005 of 94.9% were in line with fiscal 2004 levels, with certain identifiable variance factors generally offsetting. The depreciation and amortization ratio was up somewhat, driven by fixed asset investments in the U.S. Federal sector and an unfavorable mix variance resulting 25 Table of Contents from Global Commercial operations increasing as a percent of CSCs total. This increase was offset by a decrease in the interest expense ratio. Special items were flat as a percent of revenue for fiscal 2005 and 2004. Costs of Services Costs of services as a percentage of revenue decreased .3% points to 80.2% for fiscal 2006 as a result of a decrease in the Global Commercial ratio of .2% points to 76.9% and a .4% point decrease in the U.S. Federal sector ratio to 86.3%. The ratio for fiscal 2006 benefited, as noted below, from cost of services amounts carried at the Corporate level for fiscal 2005 which included $24 million of accrued cost related to the settlement of an overtime pay class action lawsuit. The Global Commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal 2006 benefited from reductions in the ratio in Europe as a result of outsourcing improvements in the United Kingdom offset somewhat by higher ratios for other European consulting and systems integration business. These improvements in Europe were offset by a higher ratio for U.S. outsourcing as a result of start up and termination activities and an unfavorable mix impact as revenue from higher margin software license sales was lower for the year. The costs of services ratio benefited from certain revenue items such as revenue settlements with clients for which the related costs were recognized in a prior period, a pre tax $8 million gain from the sale of a building and the novation of certain contracts. These items favorably benefited the ratio approximately .2% points. The U.S. Federal sector ratio for fiscal 2006 benefited from increased margins for certain time and materials contracts on subcontractor work and materials and cost containment on a fixed unit price contract. The year over year comparison also benefited .2% from unfavorable adjustments during fiscal 2005 on certain programs for which recovery of costs was not probable. These factors were somewhat offset by an adverse estimate to complete adjustment on a state project contributing approximately (.1%) points to the ratio. For fiscal 2005 costs of services as a percentage of revenue were 80.5%, unchanged from fiscal 2004. The Global Commercial sector ratio was essentially unchanged, 77.1% vs. 77.2%, but had an approximately .2% favorable mix impact on the Companys composite ratio due to the increase in Global Commercial operations as a percentage of the total. With a higher proportion of infrastructure services and a broader service offering, the Global Commercial sector cost base has relatively more depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses and less labor and other cost of services than the U.S. Federal sector. The Global Commercial cost of services ratio for fiscal 2005 benefited from certain revenue items, including the recognition of deferred revenue related to a renegotiated contract, client settlement payments and gains on the sale of minor, non core businesses. These had an approximately .4% favorable impact on the ratio. The ratio also included the adverse impact of costs related to facility consolidations in our U.S. consulting operations, certain asset write downs to net realizable value, and the cost of closure for our Australian product reseller business. These factors had an adverse impact of approximately .3% on the cost of services ratio. U.S. Federal sector cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased approximately .8% for fiscal 2005. Factors include the recognition of costs on certain programs for which recoverability has been determined to not be probable, contributing approximately .6%. The year over year comparison is also adversely impacted by approximately .3% of favorable adjustments during fiscal 2004 resulting from normal program reviews on long term projects. Cost of services amounts carried at the Corporate level for fiscal 2005 include $24 million of accrued cost related to the settlement of an overtime pay class action lawsuit. These costs were not allocated to the Companys segments as individual settlement recipients had yet to be identified. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of 5.8% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2006 were, before rounding effects, essentially unchanged from the prior year. An increase in the ratio for the U.S. 26 Table of Contents Federal operations of .5% points was offset by a decrease in the Global Commercial ratio of .1% points. The U.S. Federal sector ratio increase was attributable to increased expenses in the new business development area and increased management and bid and proposal costs. The Global commercial ratio improvement was the result of savings in new business selling costs as a result of fewer significant new business opportunities and a reduction in general and administrative costs. Global Commercial SG&A expense was adversely impacted by a pre tax $18 million provision for doubtful accounts related to negotiations with an outsourcing customer regarding certain contract provisions. The .2% point fiscal 2005 SG&A improvement compared to fiscal 2004 was attributable to improvement from both of CSCs segments. The U.S. Federal sector contributed approximately two thirds of the improvement, driven by reduced bid and proposal costs as a percentage of revenue as well as executive and administrative staff and other cost reductions. Global Commercial ratio improvement was the result of leveraging existing levels of staff and systems to support the higher revenue level, particularly in U.S. outsourcing operations. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense of $1,091.8 million for fiscal 2006 represents 7.5% of revenue and was unchanged from the ratio of 7.5% for fiscal 2005. Improvement in the U.S. Federal sector ratio was offset by an increase in the Global Commercial ratio. The U.S. Federal sector ratio decreased by .1% point predominantly due to decreases in amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the Dyncorp acquisition. The Global Commercial ratio increased as a result of significant upfront capital investment for outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal 2005 and 2004 in Europe and Asia and capital refreshes necessary on some existing contracts, offset by lower levels of capital investment for U.S. commercial operations due to the termination of the Nortel and Sears contracts and a favorable mix variance from Australian operations due to revenue growth in non capital intensive business lines. Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 7.5% from 7.2% for fiscal 2005 versus fiscal 2004. The U.S. Federal sector ratio increase, accounting for approximately .2% of the Companys ratio increase, was most significantly attributable to fixed asset investments on a large infrastructure outsourcing contract. An unfavorable mix variance, also contributing .2% of the ratio rise, was the result of the increasing Global Commercial activities share of the total. Global Commercial operations, with a higher proportion of infrastructure related services, had a higher ratio of depreciation and amortization expense to revenue. The mix impact was offset somewhat, and the Global Commercial ratio decreased slightly for fiscal 2005, due to new outsourcing accounts, particularly in the U.S., having lower depreciation and amortization than the existing composite business. This was primarily attributable to certain new clients for which CSC did not purchase the existing asset inventory, but will be responsible for asset replacement. Therefore, the depreciation ratio on those accounts can be expected to rise over time. Interest Expense and Interest Income The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due to lower average debt levels during fiscal 2006 as the result of the retirement of $1 billion of term debt during March 2005. The interest saving from the retirement of the term debt was slightly offset by an increase in interest expense from capitalized leases, and short term borrowings for working capital needs in Europe. The combination of these factors resulted in a reduction in interest expense of $52.6 million. In addition, interest income, including dividend income from the DynCorp International 13% preferred stock, increased approximately $24.7 million for fiscal 2006 resulting in a .6% improvement in the net interest expense ratio. During May 2006, the Company received approximately $169 million from DynCorp International for the redemption of the preferred stock and payment of cumulative dividends of approximately $22.5 million. The decrease in interest expense, net of interest income, for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was due to lower average debt levels and an increase in interest income. The generation of cash flow, which limited the need 27 Table of Contents to issue commercial paper, and the retirement of $1 billion of term debt during March 2005 combined to reduce interest expense by $13.0 million. In addition, interest income, including income from the invested proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International, increased approximately $6.9 million for fiscal 2005 resulting in a .2% improvement in the net interest expense ratio. Special Items Effective February 28, 2006 Nortel Networks (Nortel) terminated the Companys services for certain information technology outsourcing activities under the outsourcing agreement between Nortel and the Company. As a result of the termination of these services the Company recorded a non cash special charge of $52.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 to write down outsourcing contract costs and certain equipment associated with the contract to their estimated fair value. The Company recorded an additional charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $25.3 million to write down the remaining assets to fair value, recognize a loss on the assets sold to Nortel under the terms of the termination settlement, record severance costs for those employees who were not hired by Nortel or redeployed within the Company and record costs associated with terminating the contract for a total charge of $77.3 million ($48.3 million after tax) or 26 cents per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the Company recorded a charge of $29.5 million for premium payments and the write down of deferred financing costs and interest discount related to the early redemption of $1 billion of term debt. The Company elected to make this early redemption and incur the charges as it had available cash and these debt issues carried interest rates above current prevailing rates. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further description. The debt redemption charge was partially offset by the reversal in the fourth quarter of previously recorded facility restructuring accruals of $.9 million. The combined special items had a $0.10 per share impact on earnings per share and a .2% net impact on the Companys profit margin in fiscal 2005. CSCs net profit margin for fiscal 2004 was reduced .2% for charges associated with the Special Item related to the DynCorp acquisition. The charges relate to exit or disposal activities of legacy CSC operations as a result of an assessment of requirements for the combined CSC DynCorp organization. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further description. Charges related to this Special Item were booked during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 through the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and had a $0.08 per share impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2004. The impact to fiscal 2003 margins was insignificant. Taxes The provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was 29.7%, 30.6% and 29.6% for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate during fiscal 2006 was the result of the favorable resolution of certain tax related issues from prior years and the subsequent reversal of amounts accrued for these issues. This offset the diminishing favorable impact on the effective rate of permanent tax differences. The increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was primarily a result of increased profits and the decreasing impact of existing favorable permanent tax differences that do not vary directly with increased profits. The increases in pretax income in fiscal 2006 and 2005 resulted in a $25.1 million and $18.5 million increase in taxes on income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, compared to previous fiscal years. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations net of taxes was $61.3 million, $313.8 million and $43.2 million, respectively, for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004. Income from discontinued operations during fiscal 2006 included the gain on sale of Health Plan Solutions of $22.9 million and the gain from the working capital adjustment for the sale of DynCorp International of $38.4 million. The Company received $65.5 million par value preferred stock for the working capital adjustment and recorded taxes of $20.7 million and a valuation 28 Table of Contents allowance of approximately $6.5 million against the preferred stock. Income from discontinued operations during fiscal 2005 includes the net after tax gain on the sale of DynCorp International of $228.8 million or approximately $1.19 per share. In fiscal 2005, proceeds from the sale included $775 million of cash and $75 million of par value preferred stock. Discontinued operations for fiscal 2005 and 2004 included the operations of DynCorp International, sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, and the operations of Health Plan Solutions which was classified as held for sale as of April 1, 2005 and sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Cumulative Effect of Change in Accounting Principle In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle of $5.6 million ($4.3 million after tax) or $0.02 per share as a result of implementing the Interpretation to account for the Companys unrecorded legal obligations to restore some of its leased facilities to their original condition upon lease expiration. Earnings Per Share and Share Base Earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.48 to $3.07 for fiscal 2006. Earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 were adversely impacted by special charges of $0.26 per share, and were favorably impacted by an increase in income from continuing operations and a decline in average share base of 4.1 million for fiscal 2006. This decline in the share base was driven primarily by the Companys acquisition of 7.13 million treasury shares in the HPS exchange which reduced weighted average shares outstanding by 6.6 million shares for fiscal 2006. This reduction was partially offset by employee stock option exercises during fiscal 2006. Common stock equivalents declined slightly on a year over year basis. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash Flows Dollars in millions Fiscal2006 Fiscal2005 Fiscal2004 Net cash from operations $ 1,551.3 $ 1,941.5 $ 1,677.5 Net cash used in investing (1,124.0 ) (595.4 ) (1,325.3 ) Net cash used in financing (150.7 ) (900.6 ) (84.0 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 3.8 2.0 (5.0 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 280.4 447.5 263.2 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 1,010.3 562.8 299.6 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,290.7 $ 1,010.3 $ 562.8 Historically, the majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents have been provided from operating activities. Operating activities for fiscal 2006 generated $1.6 billion in net cash compared to $1.9 billion generated for fiscal 2005 and reflect the anticipated increase in investment in working capital assets as the result of new business won during fiscal 2005. As discussed below changes to the Companys working capital such as lower levels of accounts payable and year over year declines in the increase in the balances of accrued expenses and deferred revenue drove the decrease in operating cash flow. The Companys working capital was impacted by: During fiscal 2006 the Companys investment in unbilled receivables increased approximately $184 million, related primarily to federal contracts, compared to an increase in unbilled receivables of approximately $93 million in fiscal 2005. As a result DSO increased to 88 days at the end of fiscal 2006 compared to 83 days at the end of last year. 29 Table of Contents The Companys investment in deferred costs and work in progress related to certain contracts increased approximately $262 million offset somewhat by the expense recognition of deferred costs on other contracts during fiscal 2006. Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased $71 million for fiscal 2006 compared to an increase of $445 million for fiscal 2005. The decrease in the balance for fiscal 2006 was the result of the timing of payments for accounts payable offset somewhat by an increase in accrued expenses for activities on new contracts, the winding down of certain contracts and increased subcontractor costs on certain government contracts. The Company made payments for taxes of $147.9 million and $49.3 million for fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. Advanced payments received from customers during fiscal 2006 decreased as a result of the winding down of a contract and lower advanced payments on another contract as the contract transitions out of the start up phase. The result was a decrease in advanced payments from these contracts for fiscal 2006 of approximately $164 million compared to fiscal 2005. This decrease was somewhat offset by advanced payments on other various contracts during fiscal 2006. The Company has submitted 16 Requests for Equitable Adjustment (REAs) totaling in excess of $900 million on two U.S. Federal contracts. Included in current assets on the Companys balance sheet is approximately $770 million of unbilled accounts receivable and deferred costs related to the contracts. CSC has requested payment for certain related out of scope work directed or caused by the customers in support of their critical missions. The contractual modification process for scope changes has lagged behind the need for CSC to provide critical on going operational support. The Company does not record any profit element when it defers costs associated with such REAs. The Company believes it has a legal basis for pursuing recovery of these REAs and that collection is probable. Settlement of the amounts depends on individual circumstances and negotiations with the parties and we are unable to predict the timing of resolution of the REAs. Operating activities for fiscal 2005 generated $1.9 billion in net cash, up from $1.7 billion generated for fiscal 2004. Higher net earnings, coupled with higher levels of accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue, drove the increase in operating cash. In addition, higher non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization and an increase in deferred revenue as a result of prepayments from customers for services and up front payments for contract start up and transition activities contributed to the increase in cash generated from operating activities. Partially offsetting these inflows was an increase in prepaid expenses as the result of increases in work in process and deferred costs related to expected contract modifications with the U.S. federal government, and an increase in receivables due to the growth in revenue. The increase in receivables was driven by the increase in revenues. The Companys capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software, and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the Companys expanding Global Commercial operations. Investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades, expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets. For cash flow presentation purposes, the Outsourcing Contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contracts acquisition or start up, including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets (premium). Outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal 2005, including Zurich Financial Services and Ascension Health contracts and design and build contracts with the United Kingdoms National Health Service, drove much of the investing cash out flow during the year. While increasing new business will typically generate higher overall capital investments, the mix of the new business will also impact the level of capital. The growth in U.S. Federal awards during fiscal 2006 and the expected growth in consulting and systems integration work is expected to limit the growth in overall capital 30 Table of Contents investment in fiscal 2007 as U.S. Federal contracts and consulting and systems integration projects typically require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial outsourcing contracts. This coupled with the Companys continued focus on improving cash flows and return on investment is expected to result in a decrease in cash outflow from investing activities for fiscal 2007. Dispositions of investments in businesses have from time to time generated investing cash flows for the Company. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the disposition of DynCorp International generated $775 million in cash proceeds. As discussed below the Company used these proceeds to reduce debt levels during that quarter. As described above, historically a majority of the Companys capital investments have been funded by cash from operations. Fiscal 2006 continued to reflect this trend as the Companys debt level remained at or near its lowest level since fiscal 2000. Financing cash flows for fiscal 2005 reflected the Companys continued commitment to reduce its overall debt levels and improve its debt to total capitalization ratio as the proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International were utilized to redeem $1.0 billion of term debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Cash outflows to redeem the term debt included $27.8 million of early redemption premiums. At year end fiscal 2006 and 2005, there was no outstanding commercial paper, a result of cash generated from operations. Partially offsetting the financing cash out flows were cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal 2006 and 2005. During fiscal 2004 the Company issued $300 million of 3.50% term debt due April 2008 with the proceeds used to reduce outstanding commercial paper and support general corporate purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,290.7 million at March 31, 2006, $1,010.3 million at April 1, 2005, and $562.8 million at April 2, 2004. During fiscal 2006, equity increased as a result of the Companys earnings, the exercise of employee stock options and the impact on equity of a decrease in the unfunded pension obligation of $16.0 million ($14.2 million net of taxes), partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustment of $169.6 million and the acquisition of treasury stock. At the end of fiscal 2006, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 17.8%, consistent with fiscal 2005 year end and down from 30.1% at the end of fiscal 2004. This debt ratio improvement is the result of debt reduction and equity increases during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The Companys debt to total capitalization ratio of 17.8% as of the end of fiscal 2006 is low compared to the Companys ratios during the last five years. However, the ratio may rise in the future if the Company identifies suitable investment opportunities or experiences other significant capital requirements. Dollars in millions 2006 2005 2004 Debt $ 1,462.1 $ 1,388.7 $ 2,366.5 Equity 6,771.9 6,494.7 5,503.7 Total capitalization $ 8,234.0 $ 7,883.4 $ 7,870.2 Debt to total capitalization 17.8 % 17.6 % 30.1 % The Companys sources of liquidity include cash, commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit. Short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements. Forecasted positive cash flows for the year are expected to limit the need for short term borrowings during fiscal 2007. At March 31, 2006, the Company had a committed line of credit providing $700 million of long term commercial paper backup which expires on August 13, 2009. If the Company were unable to sell its commercial paper, borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit, or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned, the Company has the ability to borrow under this committed line of credit. This line of credit has the option of being drawn at a Base Rate, a Eurodollar Rate or a bid option rate. The line requires the Company 31 Table of Contents to 1) limit liens placed on our assets to $100 million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business; 2) maintain a not to exceed ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization of .50 to 1.00; and 3) not permit on any date the ratio of consolidated total debt outstanding to consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date, to exceed 2.50 to 1.00. For further details on this agreement please see Exhibit 10.23, which is incorporated by reference to this Annual Report. As of March 31, 2006 the Companys total liquidity was approximately $1,991 million which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1,290.7 million and availability under the syndicated backstop credit facility of $700 million. As of March 31, 2006, the Company had no borrowings under this credit facility and was in compliance with all terms of the agreement. At March 31, 2006, the Company had $56.6 million of short term borrowings and $1.4 billion of long term debt. As further described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the classification of the commercial paper is determined by the expiration date of its credit facility. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of March 31, 2006. In March 2005, the Company used the proceeds from the sale of DynCorp International and cash on hand to redeem the 7.5% term notes due August 2005, and the 6.75% term notes due June 2006 for $998.9 million, and an early redemption premium of $27.8 million. In addition, during fiscal 2004, the Company issued $300 million of term debt from its fiscal 2002 shelf registration. On March 21, 2005, the Company instituted a voluntary share repurchase program for shareholders owning less than 100 shares. Under this program which has now expired, the Company repurchased 48,443 shares for $2.2 million on April 25, 2005 and 11,000 shares for $.5 million on May 31, 2005. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of March 31, 2006: Dollars in millions Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 & thereafter Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 67.5 $ 5.4 $ 72.9 Letters of credit 219.7 .6 $ 19.1 239.4 Standby letters of credit 95.0 1.2 8.3 104.5 Foreign subsidiary debt guarantees 537.1 3.0 23.5 563.6 Total $ 919.3 $ 10.2 $ 50.9 $ 980.4 See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The following table summarizes the Companys payments on contractual obligations by period as of March 31, 2006: Dollars in millions Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Long term debt $ 498.7 $ 795.5 $ 1,294.2 Interest on fixed rate debt $ 74.9 140.1 $ 103.7 38.0 356.7 Capital lease obligations 28.5 55.1 17.0 6.3 106.9 Bank debt 56.6 56.6 Operating leases 269.4 360.3 216.7 146.5 992.9 Minimum purchase obligations 484.5 614.0 84.7 5.2 1,188.4 Other long term liabilities .2 2.4 1.5 .3 4.4 Total $ 914.1 $ 1,670.6 $ 423.6 $ 991.8 $ 4,000.1 32 Table of Contents Regarding minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities. The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall. The above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company has numerous plans, both inside and outside of the U.S., and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis. The minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors, and can be zero in some years. Funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including ERISA and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). While there are certain minimum contribution requirements, CSC may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments, changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts. During fiscal 2007, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $245 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal 2007 because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Fiscal 2006 Company contributions amounted to $226 million. These fiscal year contribution figures may differ from those in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements due to the use of a December 31st measurement date in that note. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, cash balances, and unused short term borrowing capacity. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. During fiscal 2002, the Company filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of debt and or equity securities. The Company has previously issued $600 million worth of term debt from the shelf registration, leaving $900 million of shelf available for additional securities. There can be no assurances the Company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms. Dividends and Redemption It has been the Companys policy to invest earnings in the growth of the Company rather than distribute earnings as dividends. This policy, under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal 1969, is expected to continue, but is subject to regular review by the Board of Directors. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues. While changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements, the risk is mitigated by our broad portfolio of contracts that would typically have offsetting adjustments. 33 Table of Contents We have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates relate to: revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill; assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition The majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates. Revenue from our fixed unit price contracts, time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time. However, for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation. Under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved. Costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved. The method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. Modifications to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. We routinely negotiate such contract modifications in both the U.S. Federal and Global Commercial segments. Many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers. The total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value. These relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value. Once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements, revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered. Estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume difference, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception. Revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization If significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results. 34 Table of Contents Capitalization of outsourcing contract costs Certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set up costs, and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets (premiums). Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion, to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues. Capitalization of software development costs We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs, we must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations. Estimates used to determine deferred income taxes We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill We account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value. Third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities, but even 35 Table of Contents those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired. As goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment. Such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values. Cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates, which involve the input of numerous Company professionals from finance, operations and program management. Key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. Significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities We offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. In making these assumptions, we are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan, the asset mix of the plan, historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors. The weighted average of the expected long term rates of return, for all plans, on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2006 pension plan valuations was 7.8% compared to 7.7% used in fiscal 2005. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the net periodic pension cost by approximately $13 million. An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal 2006 pension plan valuations was 5.6% compared to 5.9% used for fiscal 2005. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately $35 million, or increased it by approximately $36 million, respectively. Some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts. The accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year. Such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time. For CSC, positive market returns for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected. Declining discount rates over the past 36 Table of Contents several years, which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations, served to partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, respectively. SFAS No. 87 requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) at the end of the year. At the end of both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, some of our pension plans had ABOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, thus requiring additional minimum obligations. The excess at the end of fiscal 2006 was lower than at the end of fiscal 2005. As a result, we were required to adjust the additional minimum pension liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The effect of this adjustment was to decrease the minimum pension liability by $27.7 million during fiscal 2006, decrease intangible assets by $11.7 million and record an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $16.0 million ($14.2 million net of taxes). Based on future plan asset performance and interest rates, additional changes to equity might be required. Assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation We are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt. Foreign Currency During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received. Short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. By generally matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. However, the Company is increasing its use of offshore support and is therefore becoming more exposed to currency fluctuations. If necessary, the Company may use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions. During fiscal 2006, 38.1% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. Using sensitivity analysis, a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 3.81% or $557.2 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 3.81% or $557.2 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by $33.9 million. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. At March 31, 2006, the Company had approximately $492.5 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $60.5 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 37 Table of Contents
