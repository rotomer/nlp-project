Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and associated notes for the year ended April 3, 2009. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: 1) Provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; 2) Enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes, providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed; and 3) Provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. To achieve these objectives, the discussion is presented in the following sections: Overviewincludes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash, as well as a discussion of the economic and industry factors, key business drivers, key performance indicators, fiscal 2009 highlights, and fiscal 2010 commentary. Results of Operationsdiscusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal 2007 to 2009, describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and currency impacts, and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories. Financial Conditiondiscusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the Companys liquidity and available capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimatesdiscusses accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. OVERVIEW The Companys primary service offerings are IT and business process outsourcing, and IT and professional services. Outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customers technology infrastructure and applications, and business process outsourcing. IT and professional services include systems integration, consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services. Under the Companys comprehensive growth strategy introduced in fiscal 2009, known as Project Accelerate, the Company targets the delivery of its services within three broad service lines: Business Solutions and Services (BS&S), Global Outsourcing Services (GOS) and North American Public Sector (NPS). NPS and GOS are each separate reportable segments, while BS&S consists of three reportable segments. The five segments are as follows: 1. North American Public Sector. The North American Public Sector segment operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations, Cost Accounting Standards and audits by various U.S. federal agencies. The North American Public Sector operating segment represents a separate reportable segment. 23 2. Global Outsourcing Services. The Global Outsourcing Services segment provides large scale outsourcing solutions offerings as well as midsize services delivery to customers globally. The Global Outsourcing Services operating segment represents a separate reportable segment. 3. Business Solutions and Services Consulting. In the BS&S Consulting segment, the Company provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services, business process outsourcing, and intellectual property (IP) based software solutions. These service offerings and clientele overlap and the Company draws on multiple operating segments within BS&S Consulting to serve clients. These operating segments have similar economic characteristics, products, services, customers and methods of operations and, as a result, are aggregated for segment reporting purposes. 4. Business Solutions and Services Financial Services Sector. The BS&S Financial Services Sector segment primarily provides IP based software solutions and business process outsourcing services to financial services companies in domestic and international markets. 5. Business Solutions and Services Other. The Companys remaining operating segments do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure and do not meet the aggregation criteria as indicated in SFAS No. 131. As a result, these operating segments are reported as other as indicated by SFAS No. 131. Because each of these other operating segments are within the Companys BS&S service line, the Company has labeled this group of operating segments as BS&S Other. The operating segments comprising BS&S Other include the Companys non GOS operations in Australia and Asia and the Companys India operations.

Economic and Industry Factors The Companys results of operations are affected by economic conditions generally, including macroeconomic conditions. We are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us. A severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate. This may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations. Particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty, we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations. Our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve, as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance. 24 Revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients. Our ability to add value to clients and therefore drive revenues depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. The BS&S segments and the GOS segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on IT projects. CSC is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors, including service offerings and flexibility. Management monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. Outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships. Long term, complex outsourcing contracts, including their consulting components, require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work, in order to meet clients evolving business needs and our performance expectations. The North American Public Sector segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract is terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed. Shifting priorities of the U.S. government can also impact the future of projects. Management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts, legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations. Business Drivers Revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to 10 years or more. Factors affecting revenue include: the Companys ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards, the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes, the ability to compete on services offered, technical ability, experience and flexibility, the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues, and currency fluctuations related to international operations. Earnings are driven by the above revenue factors, in addition to the following: the ability to control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs, the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses, the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals, and the ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore. 25 Cash flows are impacted by the above earnings factors, in addition to other factors including the following: timely management of receivables and payables, investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts, and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments. Key Performance Indicators The Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue growth, margins, cash flow and return on investment. New contract winsIn addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the Companys ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or re competed contracts, as well as numerous external factors. CSC employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts. Revenue growthYear over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth. MarginsMargins reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations. Cash flowOver time the primary drivers of the Companys cash flow are earnings provided by the Companys operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings. Also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances. The Company also regularly reviews the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements of operating, investing and financing cash flows, as well as the non GAAP measure free cash flow. Return on investment (ROI)ROI is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization. A combination of strong margins (measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue) and investment base turnover (measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital) is required to generate sufficient returns on capital. Strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns. Readers should be cautioned that Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), free cash flow and ROI are non GAAP measures, and the Companys definition of such measures may differ from other companies. Therefore, such measures may not be comparable to those of other companies. CSC believes these non GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the Companys financial condition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the Companys performance and ability to service its debt. CSC calculates DSO as follows: Total accounts receivable at fiscal period end divided by revenue per day. Total accounts receivables excludes tax receivables. Revenue per day is calculated based on fiscal days in the most recent quarter. Free cash flow is equal to the sum of (1) operating cash flows, (2) investing cash flows, excluding business acquisitions and dispositions, purchase or sale of available for sale securities, and (3) capital lease payments. 26 ROI is calculated by multiplying profit before interest expense, special items, and after tax expense by the investment base turnover. Investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity for the period. The Companys management uses ROI, DSO and free cash flow to evaluate investment returns and cash flow performance and are some of the measures used to assess management performance. Fiscal 2009 Highlights In fiscal 2009s difficult economic environment, the Company delivered improved revenue, pre tax profit, net income, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. Margins improved due to continued focus on productivity and cost management. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 24.3 million shares of its common stock, also contributing to improved earnings per share due to the consequent share base reduction for fiscal 2009, despite associated financing costs. Significant events during fiscal 2009 include: Revenues improved $240.4 million or 1.5%, while increasing 4.3% on a constant currency basis. Net income increased 104% to $1.11 billion, reflecting significant tax benefits from resolutions and adjustments in the U.S. federal and state, as well as international tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share were up 128% on a diluted basis. The Company announced contract awards of $16.2 billion including new NPS segment awards of $7.3 billion, BS&S segments awards of $4.4 billion, and GOS segment awards of $4.5 billion. Free cash flow of $1,020.6 million increased $845.4 million from fiscal 2008, driven by improved operating cash flows and lower capital expenditures.(1) DSO was 84 days at April 3, 2009, versus 90 days at March 28, 2008. Debt to total capitalization ratio was 43.5% at year end, an increase of 4.6% from 38.9% in fiscal 2008 ratio. ROI was 14.9% for the year, up from 9.2% in fiscal 2008, driven significantly by fiscal 2009 tax benefits. (1) The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure: Fiscal Year Ended (In millions) April 3, 2009 March 28, 2008 March 30, 2007 Free cash flow $ 1,020.6 $ 175.2 $ 671.5 Net cash used in investing activities 1,038.0 2,718.7 872.7 Proceeds from redemption of investment in preferred stock 126.5 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (100.3 ) (1,591.1 ) (134.3 ) Business dispositions 2.8 Capital lease payments 28.1 40.1 39.4 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,986.4 $ 1,342.9 $ 1,578.6 Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,038.0 ) $ (2,718.7 ) $ (872.7 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) financing activities $ 742.1 $ 997.9 $ (955.5 ) 27 The Companys significant wins and scope extensions during fiscal 2009 included the following: Global Outsourcing Services: Bombardier ($944 million), Zurich Omni ($399 million), TDC Applications ($413 million), Exelon ($150 million). North American Public Sector: U.S. Air and Missile Contracts ($341 million), U.S. Army ($1.5 billion), U.S. Navy and NAVSEA ($570 million), State of North Carolina ($265 million), eMED New York ($322 million), and Department of Health Services (DHS) ($475 million). The Company changed its methodology for determining the announced value for certain awards. NPS announced values for ID/IQ awards represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract. The bookings value of GOS announced awards are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates and include optional contract years. The announced values for BS&S line of business awards are based on firm commitments. The Company has developed a broad, long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines. A significant amount of CSCs revenues is derived from long term contracts including information technology outsourcing, build and maintain engagements and U.S. federal government engagements. This provides the Company with a base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens. Cash and cash equivalents at April 3, 2009, was nearly $2.3 billion, up from approximately $700 million in fiscal 2008, a $1.6 billion increase compared to a $350 million decrease from fiscal 2007 to 2008. The fiscal 2009 increase reflected increased cash flows from operating activities and lower uses of cash in investing activities. The higher operating cash flow was primarily attributable to higher net income, with significant non cash tax benefits to net income offset by other improvements in working capital. The lower investing cash flows were primarily due to fiscal 2009 expenditures for acquisitions of $100 million, versus $1.6 billion for fiscal 2008. Cash provided from financing activities during fiscal 2009 reflect the Companys draw down of a credit facility, offset by principal payments on the long term debt and commercial paper. Free cash flow for fiscal 2009 was $1.0 billion, compared to $175 million for fiscal 2008. The comparison reflects the fiscal 2009 improvement in operating cash flows as well as lower capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. The fiscal 2008 results also include significant restructuring outflows and the adverse impact of several timing matters with fiscal 2007, primarily fiscal 2007 capital expenditures paid for in fiscal 2008 and a large prepayment received at the end of fiscal 2007. 28 Fiscal 2010 Commentary Although management believes CSCs broad service portfolio positions it well to assist public and private sector clients in the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment, the Company expects continued overall pressure on revenue growth during fiscal 2010. Management will continue to focus on cost control and cash flow. As a leading federal contractor and one of the top IT service providers to the U.S. federal government, CSCs NPS segment is well positioned to benefit from the demand for IT services in this market. CSC sees opportunities for significant growth in the areas of health information and services, and cyber security, both of which are priority areas for funding. CSC anticipates continued strong funding levels in the Department of Defense, especially in the logistical support and training segments of the budget, and in the Department of Homeland Security for infrastructure modernization. Overall, NPS revenue is expected to grow at or above the fiscal 2009 level, benefiting from the $7.3 billion in bookings in fiscal 2009. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds and project assignments can vary, the Company expects broad IT and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government. The Company expects the global commercial market to remain challenging during fiscal 2010, due to the current global economic environment. CSC has a base of significant outsourcing contracts, which the Company expects will continue to provide a stable revenue stream during fiscal 2010 in its GOS segment. However, growth from this revenue stream is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and the resulting pressure on prices, as well as volatility in the short term projects. Demand for services in the BS&S segments is also expected to suffer due to the global economic situation. During fiscal 2009, the Companys GOS and BS&S revenue was negatively impacted by currency fluctuations. While exchange rates have stabilized recently, currency movements continue to be a major influence on results and the Company is unable to predict such changes. With limited opportunities for revenue growth expected, management intends to increase its focus on operating income margin in fiscal 2010. Management of SG&A and other overhead costs, as well as continuing utilization of offshore and nearshore cost centers, is expected to mitigate margin pressure from lower revenue. The Company also will continue its focus on cash management, though fiscal 2010 free cash flow is not expected to match that of fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2009 achievement benefited from a six day improvement in DSO which is not anticipated to recur in fiscal 2010. Also, the company anticipates the relatively low capital expenditures made in fiscal 2009 will not be maintained in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2009 free cash flow also benefited from realized gains on foreign currency hedging programs. Such gains or losses are dependent on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates which the Company is unable to predict. However, the Company continues to target free cash flow to approximate 90% of net income. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues for the North American Public Sector, Global Outsourcing Services, and Business Solutions and Services segments (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements) for fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 are as follows: 29 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount BS&S Consulting $ 2,034.3 11.1 % $ 1,831.5 16.1 % $ 1,577.1 BS&S Financial Services 990.8 (2.6 ) 1,017.3 4.4 974.1 BS&S Other 1,384.6 12.9 1,225.9 79.8 681.7 Business Solutions and Services 4,409.7 8.2 4,074.7 26.0 3,232.9 Global Outsourcing Services 6,458.5 (4.4 ) 6,756.0 6.7 6,333.5 North American Public Sector 5,977.4 3.4 5,781.1 6.1 5,446.5 Corporate 17.4 17.6 35.8 Subtotal 16,863.0 1.4 16,629.4 10.5 15,048.7 Eliminations (123.1 ) (129.9 ) (193.8 ) Total Revenue $ 16,739.9 1.5 $ 16,499.5 11.1 $ 14,854.9 The major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows: Fiscal 2009 vs. Fiscal 2008 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total BS&S Consulting 8.1 % (5.7 )% 8.7 % 11.1 % BS&S Financial Services Sector (1.2 ) (1.4 ) (2.6 ) BS&S Other 10.7 (3.0 ) 5.2 12.9 Business Solutions and Services 6.9 (3.7 ) 5.0 8.2 Global Outsourcing Services .7 (4.6 ) (.5 ) (4.4 ) North American Public Sector 3.4 3.4 Total Revenue 2.0 (2.8 ) 2.3 1.5 Fiscal 2008 vs. Fiscal 2007 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total BS&S Consulting 2.3 % 6.9 % 6.9 % 16.1 % BS&S Financial Services Sector 1.4 3.0 4.4 BS&S Other 56.6 12.4 10.8 79.8 Business Solutions and Services 13.1 6.5 6.4 26.0 Global Outsourcing Services .3 5.2 1.2 6.7 North American Public Sector 1.8 4.3 6.1 Total Revenue 3.6 3.6 3.9 11.1 Fiscal 2009 vs. Fiscal 2008 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total BS&S Consulting 8.1 % (5.7 )% 8.7 % 11.1 % (1.2 ) (1.4 ) (2.6 ) BS&S Other 10.7 (3.0 ) 5.2 12.9 Business Solutions and Services 6.9 (3.7 ) 5.0 8.2 Global Outsourcing Services .7 (4.6 ) (.5 ) (4.4 ) North American Public Sector 3.4 3.4 Total Revenue 2.0 (2.8 ) 2.3 1.5 Fiscal 2008 vs. Fiscal 2007 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total BS&S Consulting 2.3 % 6.9 % 6.9 % 16.1 % BS&S Financial Services Sector 1.4 3.0 4.4 BS&S Other 56.6 12.4 10.8 79.8 Business Solutions and Services 13.1 6.5 6.4 26.0 Global Outsourcing Services .3 5.2 1.2 6.7 North American Public Sector 1.8 4.3 6.1 Total Revenue 3.6 3.6 3.9 11.1 30 Business Solutions and Services Fiscal 2009 Revenue from the BS&S segments operations for fiscal 2009 increased approximately $335 million or 8.2% compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of the fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Covansys Corporation (Covansys) and First Consulting Group (FCG) which contributed approximately $132.8 million and $148.1 million of growth, respectively, during fiscal 2009 (Covansys was acquired in July 2007 and FCG was acquired in January 2008). BS&S Consulting segment revenue increased $202.8 million, or 11.1% during fiscal 2009, and 16.8% excluding the effect of currency. Approximately $135.0 million of the growth came from consulting and systems integration operations in North America, driven by the $148.1 million from the acquisition of FCG. A slight drop in remaining North American operations was due to a decrease in staff utilization rates which were only partially offset by improved billing rates. European operations primarily comprised the remainder of the BSS Consulting increase, despite adverse currency movements. The higher growth came from new project work as well as increased scope at existing customers. While the achievement of revenue milestones on the National Health Service (NHS) contract in the United Kingdom resulted in NHS year over year growth in local currency, revenue was down slightly on NHS after the effect of currency. BS&S Financial Services Sector segment revenue decreased approximately $26.5 million, 2.6% or 1.4% excluding currency in fiscal 2009. In North America, decreases in credit reporting and consulting services more than offset increases in sales of software licenses. Lower license sales and consulting revenue in Europe provided the remainder of the decrease. BS&S Other segment revenue increased $158.7 million, or 12.9%, or 15.9% excluding currency. The increase was primarily the result of the full year impact of the fiscal 2008 acquisition of Covansys which provided approximately $132.8 million of revenue growth. Fiscal 2008 Revenue from the BS&S segments operations for fiscal 2008 increased approximately $842 million or 26% compared to the prior year. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of the acquisitions of Covansys Corporation and FCG which contributed approximately $386 million and $37 million, respectively, during fiscal 2008. Growth in Europe consulting and systems integration operations contributed $258 million in additional revenue. BS&S Consulting segment revenue increased 16.1% during fiscal 2008 or 9.2% excluding the effects of currency. The increase in revenue was the result of achievement of revenue milestones on the NHS contract, which contributed $110 million of revenue growth during fiscal 2008, and growth on project work in the West and Central regions of Europe as a result of increases in hourly billing rates. The growth in revenue in Europe was partially offset by a decline in revenue for consulting and systems integration operations in North America of approximately $9 million as a result of a decline in utilization rates and headcount which was partially offset by an increase in the hourly billing rate and the acquisition of FCG which contributed $37 million of revenue during fiscal 2008. 31 BS&S Financial Services Sector segment revenue increased approximately $43 million during fiscal 2008. In North America increases in business process outsourcing activities and consulting services more than offset declines in sales of software licenses resulting in an increase in revenue of approximately $29 million. License sales and consulting revenue in Europe provided the remainder of the increase in revenue during fiscal 2008. BS&S Other segment revenue increased $544 million during fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of Covansys Corporation which provided approximately $386 million of revenue during fiscal 2008. The remainder of the increase in revenue was from a professional staffing business in Australia which provided $70 million of revenue growth and from consulting and systems integration activities in Australia and Asia. Global Outsourcing Services Fiscal 2009 GOS segment revenue declined $297.5 million in fiscal 2009, or 4.4%, but was up .2% when excluding foreign currency effects of over $310 million. On a constant currency basis, increased revenue in Europe ($23 million), Australia ($16 million) and Asia ($27 million) offset declines in North America ($49 million). The higher international revenue was due to the full year effects of new fiscal 2008 contracts as well as scope extensions on others. European growth of $179 million was mostly offset by the impact of renegotiating terms of certain existing contracts and a contract conclusion totaling $156 million. In North America, contract conclusions of $202 million and scope reductions on existing contracts of $54 million more than offset new fiscal 2009 and annualized fiscal 2008 wins of $162 million and the full year impact of the fiscal 2008 FCG acquisition of $46 million. Fiscal 2008 GOS segment revenue growth of 6.7% (1.5% excluding currency effects) for fiscal 2008 was the result of growth in new business in Europe, growth on existing engagements and the acquisition of FCG which provided $20 million of revenue in fiscal 2008. A year over year decline in North American revenue from outsourcing services of approximately $70 million partially offset the growth in international operations. New contracts with the United Kingdoms public sector, an investment bank, a telecommunications company and an automobile parts supplier provided approximately $200 million of revenue growth in Europe. Outsourcing services revenue in Europe also benefited from growth on existing contracts which provided $58 million of revenue during fiscal 2008. Australia and Asia provided approximately $60 million and $25 million of revenue growth in outsourcing services during fiscal 2008 with the growth primarily from existing engagements. The decline in revenue in North America was the result of the end of contracts with a local government and a hospital company and reduction in base line rates on certain existing contracts as these contracts mature. North American Public Sector The Companys North American Public Sector segment revenues were derived from the following sources: Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount Department of Defense $ 4,203.3 8.9 % $ 3,859.7 7.1 % $ 3,603.3 Civil agencies 1,615.3 (6.9 ) 1,734.0 2.8 1,686.8 Other (1) 158.8 (15.3 ) 187.4 19.8 156.4 Total North American Public Sector $ 5,977.4 3.4 $ 5,781.1 6.1 $ 5,446.5 (1) Other revenues consist of foreign, state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the North American Public Sector segment. 32 Fiscal 2009 NPS Sector segment revenue increased $196.3 million or 3.4% to $5,977.4 million for fiscal 2009. The revenue growth was the result of new business awarded during fiscal 2009 and 2008, increases on existing Department of Defense contracts, and an acquisition. Acquisition of a logistics engineering business contributed $14 million to revenue growth for fiscal 2009. This growth was partially offset by revenue reductions due to concluding contracts and reductions on other programs. The NPS continued to win significant new business during fiscal 2009 with announced new U.S. federal contract awards of $7.25 billion. Department of Defense revenue increased $343.6 million or 8.9% to $4,203.3 million for fiscal 2009. Growth was the result of new contracts for analysis, engineering, surveillance and reconnaissance support for the U.S. Army. The Company benefited from significant contracts involving the expansion of field operations vehicles and strategic planning and management for the Missile Defense Agency. The Company also benefited from new contracts to provide application hosting, system engineering, software development, and web applications services for an intelligence contract. Under a task order valued at $369 million, the Company also engaged in professional services support for the Naval Sea Systems Engineering Directorate. This growth was partially offset by the end of certain programs. Civil agencies revenue decreased $118.7 million, or 6.9%, versus fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of reduced activity and the end of certain programs with NASA. Other NPS revenue decreased $28.6 million, or 15.3%, versus fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of client budget constraints and delayed commitments from clients. Fiscal 2008 Department of Defense revenue increased $256 million or 7.1% to $3,860 million for fiscal 2008. Growth was the result of continuing demand for equipment procurement and installation services for the U.S. Army with a new procurement contract, increased scope and task orders on a program to provide systems integration services to the U.S. Army, a new program to provide systems integration and equipment installation services to the U.S. Air Force, an increase in task orders on a program to provide programs and software engineering to the Missile Defense Agency, increased task orders on a program to provide management services for certain intelligence services and additional task orders on a program to provide IT engineering services to the U.S. Navy. These new programs and tasking provided approximately $356 million in revenue growth for fiscal 2008. This growth was partially offset by the end of a classified program and a program to provide system development services to the U.S. Army and the loss of contracts to provide maintenance and support services which combined provided additional revenue of approximately $141 million in the prior year. In addition, on certain programs funds were redirected to other procurement programs and revenue declined on these programs as a consequence. Civil agencies revenue, excluding acquisitions, decreased $19 million, or 1.1%, versus fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of reduced activity and the end of certain programs with NASA. These decreases were offset by the acquisition at the end of the third quarter of the prior year of an identity management and credentialing business which contributed $99 million to revenue growth in fiscal 2008. Work performed by the North American Public Sector for state and local governments as well as commercial clients was $187 million for fiscal 2008, an increase of $31 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of a new contract with a non governmental aid organization which contributed $31 million of revenue during fiscal 2008. 33 Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Dollar Amount Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization) $ 13,260.7 $ 13,151.9 $ 11,813.5 79.2 % 79.7 % 79.5 % Selling, general and administrative 1,082.8 975.4 918.3 6.5 5.9 6.2 Depreciation and amortization 1,185.5 1,198.6 1,073.6 7.1 7.3 7.2 Goodwill impairment 18.9 .1 Interest expense, net 219.5 148.3 168.4 1.3 .9 1.1 Special items 155.8 316.1 .9 2.1 Other expense/(income) 23.4 (48.4 ) (41.3 ) .1 (.3 ) (.2 ) Total $ 15,790.8 $ 15,581.6 $ 14,248.6 94.3 % 94.4 % 95.9 % Fiscal 2009 Historically, the Company has substantially matched revenues and costs in the same currency. However, the Company is increasing its use of offshore support and therefore is increasingly exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2009 improved slightly to 94.3% from 94.4% in fiscal 2008. Offsetting a cost of services ratio decrease of .5% in fiscal 2009 was a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense ratio increase in equal amount, which was a result of relatively higher marketing and branding costs, development of new service offerings, relocation of the Companys headquarters, client targeting, and increased amounts charged to allowance for doubtful accounts. The depreciation and amortization ratio declined slightly due to less capital expenditure. The interest expense ratio increased as a result of fiscal 2008s fourth quarter term debt offering to replace commercial paper and the drawdown of the credit facility during fiscal 2009. The Company also incurred a goodwill impairment charge as further described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense of $23.4 million was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. In fiscal 2008, the Company had net gains in foreign currency and also had gains from the sale of non operating assets. See Notes 8 and 14 for further discussion of the Companys foreign currency hedging program. Fiscal 2008 Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2008 decreased 1.5% points to 94.4% from 95.9% for fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of a reduction in costs incurred for restructuring activities during fiscal 2007, accounting for 1.2% points. The cost of services ratio increased primarily as a result of an estimate to complete adjustment on a contract with a U.S. government agency. The SG&A expense ratio decreased as a result of (1) the impact of restructuring activities, (2) a reduction in bid and proposal costs due to a number of contract renewals in the prior year, and (3) the acquisition of Covansys Corporation which has a lower cost ratio than the Companys legacy business. The depreciation and amortization ratio was essentially unchanged from the prior year. The interest expense ratio decreased as a result of two offsetting factors: (1) beginning in fiscal 2008 the classification of income tax related interest expense as income tax expense as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 which in fiscal 2007 and 2006 was included in interest expense, and (2) additional borrowings of $1.7 billion to finance the acquisitions of Covansys and FCG. Other income increased due to gains from the sale of non operating assets which offset a decline in foreign currency exchange gains. 34 Costs of Services Fiscal 2009 Costs of services as a percentage of revenue decreased .5% points to 79.2% for fiscal 2009, primarily driven by improvements in the GOS, NPS and BSS Other segments. GOS operations in Europe benefited from the prior years restructuring program as well as improved performance on certain large accounts. The improvements in Europe more than offset higher costs as a percentage of revenue in the GOS Americas region, which were driven primarily from impairments of approximately $26 million for deferred contract and other costs associated with two contracts. The NPS segment ratio for fiscal 2009 improved as fiscal 2008s results included charges on a fixed price contract with the IRS of $42 million as noted below. Absent the fiscal 2008 charge, the ratio was virtually unchanged. In the BS&S Other segment, improvements in CSC India were driven primarily by the weakening of the rupee during fiscal 2009 which reduced costs on US dollar denominated contracts. Fiscal 2008 Costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased .2% points to 79.7% for fiscal 2008 as a result of an increase in the North American Public Sector segment ratio of 0.7% points to 86.8% and a 1.4% point increase in the BS&S Other segment to 80.6%. The increase in the cost of services ratio for the North American Public Sector segment was primarily due to an estimate to complete adjustment in Civil agencies while the increase in the ratio for BS&S Other was from growth in a staffing business which has lower operating margins than the other operations within BS&S Other segment which include consulting and systems integration services and business process outsourcing. The NPS segment ratio for fiscal 2008 increased .6% points primarily as a result of charges recorded on a fixed price contract with the IRS. As the result of amending a fixed priced contract with the IRS the Company recorded a forward loss and reduced pre contract costs related to the contract to their estimated recoverable amount. The combined charge was $42 million. The impact of this charge was partially offset by the improvement in the margin on a fixed price contract and cost reduction initiatives undertaken during fiscal 2008. The GOS segment ratio decreased to 74.6% primarily as a result of the impact of the restructuring plan in Europe where the ratio improved 2.1%. The ratio in North America was adversely affected by a $13 million charge to resolve a dispute with a customer regarding a receivable. The adverse impact of the charge was partially offset by the termination of certain lower margin contracts. The BS&S line of business cost of services ratio for fiscal 2008 increased approximately 1.9%. The ratio in the BS&S Other segment increased approximately 1.4% as a result of an increase in the ratio in Australia where revenue growth in a lower margin professional staffing business increased the ratio for the segment. The BS&S Financial Services Sector segment ratio increased 1.8% points due primarily to a decrease in license sales, which attract minimal cost of services charges, in the United States and in Europe. The ratio for the BS&S Consulting segment also increased as the result of an increase in its North America operations ratio due to a decrease in the utilization rate from the prior year. 35 Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal 2009 SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased .6% points to 6.5% for fiscal 2009 primarily due to increases in Corporate and GOS segment SG&A. GOS SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 1.1% points in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 in the Europe and North American regions. The higher GOS costs were driven by increases in allowances for bad debt expense, business development expenses, customer relationships management, and costs incurred to introduce the new CSC brand in Europe. The customer relationship costs and branding efforts were part of the Companys roll out of Project Accelerate in fiscal 2009. Corporate G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 0.2% points in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008, and related to the roll out of the new CSC brand and costs incurred to relocate the Companys headquarters. Partly offsetting the higher SG&A cost percentages was an improvement of .2% points in the NPS segment. Fiscal 2008 SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by .3% points to 5.9% for fiscal 2008. The improvement in the ratio was attributed to three factors: (1) the restructuring activities in the BS&S segments, primarily in the BS&S Financial Services Sector segment, where the ratio improved by .7% points, (2) lower bid and proposal costs in GOS segment in Australia which had a number of contracts up for re bid in the prior year, and (3) the acquisition of Covansys Corporation in the BS&S Other segment during the second quarter which had a lower selling, general and administrative expense ratio than the Companys previously existing businesses. The NPS segment ratio was essentially flat to the prior year with a slight increase in the ratio due to increased bid and proposal costs in fiscal 2008. At the Corporate level the Company incurred professional services costs as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 and the restatement of the prior year financial statements. However, these costs were approximately the same as costs incurred during fiscal 2007 related to the stock option investigation and did not result in a significant change in the expense ratio. Depreciation and Amortization Fiscal 2009 Depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense as a percentage of revenue decreased .2% points to 7.1% during fiscal 2009. The primary driver for the decrease was a favorable mix shift towards a lower revenue volume in GOS relative to the other segments. GOS D&A as a percentage of revenue is in excess of 12% as compared to the consolidated average of 7.1% and 7.3% in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. As GOS revenue declined from 41% of total CSC revenue to 38% from fiscal 2009 to 2008, the consolidated D&A percentage of revenue improved accordingly. The expense ratio also improved slightly in NPS, which had a lower than average ratio of 2.3% and 2.6% in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, and which had a larger proportionate share of revenues year over year from 35% up to 36%. The NPS improvement resulted from reductions in capital expenditures, and reduced amortization of transition costs and customer intangibles. The BS&S Financial Services segment also had improved performance in the North America region as D&A improved from 8.1% to 6.2% of revenues, primarily driven by lower amortization on internally developed software and the absence of fiscal 2009 depreciation on a building sold at the end of fiscal 2008. 36 Fiscal 2008 Depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 billion for fiscal 2008 represents 7.3% of revenue and was essentially unchanged from the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expense was stable, as a percentage of revenue for the NPS Sector segment. The NPS Sector segment depreciation and amortization expense ratio was unchanged from the 2007 level as expenses increased at approximately the same rate as revenues which increased by 6.1%. The GOS segment ratio declined .1% from the prior year ratio primarily as a result of the termination of the Sears and Nortel Networks contracts which required significant investment in equipment. The BS&S segments ratio increased .8% points as a result of (1) an increase in the ratio of 1.5% in the BS&S Consulting segment due to investment in the NHS contract in Europe and the amortization of customer intangibles from the FCG acquisition, (2) an increase in the BS&S Other segment ratio of 1.2% due to the acquisition of Covansys and the amortization of customer intangibles. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the ratio for the BS&SFinancial Services Sector segment of .6% due to reductions in new asset purchases. Goodwill Impairment Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in our second quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, the Companys stock price fluctuated, which the Company believes is due to the uncertainty related to the global economy and overall stock market volatility. As a result, the Companys market capitalization was frequently less than its net book value during the third and fourth quarters. At January 2, 2009, the Company evaluated all relevant factors and determined an interim impairment test was not necessary. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company undertook its fiscal 2010 budgeting process and at the end of the quarter, having substantially completed its budgeting process, determined that the expected cash flows for certain reporting units were significantly less than the estimated cash flows utilized in the fiscal 2009 annual impairment test. Management concluded these factors were a triggering event indicating potential impairment and performed an impairment test of goodwill. Based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an $18.9 million goodwill impairment charge, equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the CSA reporting unit. There were no other significant intangible assets attributed to the CSA reporting nor were any other long lived assets attributable to that reporting unit determined to be impaired. CSA, a value added reseller and provider of installation, warranty, and maintenance services in respect of IT equipment, is included in the BS&S Other reportable segment. For further discussion about goodwill impairment testing and the related estimates and assumptions, see Critical Accounting Estimates in this Managements Discussion and Analysis as well as Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 1A Risk Factors in this Form 10 K. 37 Interest Expense and Interest Income Fiscal 2009 The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2009 of $75.1 million compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily a result of the issuance of debt for a combined $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008 to finance the acquisitions of Covansys Corporation and FCG. Interest expense for these notes and commercial paper was approximately $116.5 million for fiscal 2009, an increase from $47.3 million in fiscal 2008. Approximately $27.0 million of the remaining interest expense increase was due to the $1.5 billion draw down in the credit facility in October 2008 to repay commercial paper and increase the Companys liquidity position. The lower commercial paper outstanding and the maturity of the 3.5% $300 million senior notes in April 2008 resulted in lower interest expense which partially offset the increase. In addition, higher borrowings in Europe to fund working capital requirements and additional capital leases in NPS contributed to interest expense. Interest income increased approximately $3.9 million as a result of an increase in cash balances from the drawdown of the credit facility as well as higher cash balances in India. Fiscal 2008 The decrease in interest expense for fiscal 2008 of $32.5 million compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the election to classify interest on tax related income tax liabilities of $77.8 million on the income tax expense line upon the adoption of FIN 48 during fiscal 2008. The prior year periods have not been adjusted to reflect this change in classification and include tax related interest of $75.4 million and $41.1 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Partially offsetting this classification change was interest on $1.7 billion of commercial paper, subsequently converted to senior notes, issued to finance the acquisition of Covansys Corporation and FCG Corporation. The issuance of the commercial paper and the senior notes resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $40.1 million for fiscal 2008. Interest income decreased by approximately $12.4 million for fiscal 2008 as a result of a decline in cash balances and income from securities sold in the prior year. Special Items No Special items were recorded during fiscal year 2009. Special items totaling $155.8 million were recorded during fiscal 2008 and consisted of: (1) a $133.4 million restructuring charge (see discussion below), and (2) a $22.4 million charge related to the retirement of the Companys chairman and chief executive officer recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2007, special items totaling $316.1 million were recorded and consisted of: (1) a $333.4 million restructuring charge (see discussion below), (2) a year to date $1.0 million true up of an estimate related to the fiscal 2006 Nortel impairment charge and (3) an $18.3 million gain from the redemption of DynCorp International preferred stock recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Restructuring In April 2006, the Company announced a restructuring plan to be carried out during fiscal 2007 and 2008. The objectives of the plan were to 1) streamline CSCs worldwide operations and 2) leverage the increased use of lower cost global resources. Restructuring charges consisted predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007 the Company evaluated facility consolidation opportunities and other areas where operations could be streamlined and costs reduced consistent with the plan objectives, resulting in additional lease termination, asset impairment and other charges. Workforce reductions, including some voluntary terminations, in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were approximately 1,400 and 4,400, respectively. 38 The Company did not record any termination related restructuring charges as special items in fiscal 2009. Termination related charges were $110.7 million and $294.3 million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Other costs, which were primarily related to vacant space, of $22.7 million and $39.1 million were also recorded during fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. All of the restructuring charge in fiscal 2008 was incurred in the BS&S segments. Restructuring charges of $333.4 million were recorded in fiscal year 2007. The restructuring plan generated savings of approximately $389 million in fiscal 2008 against a plan of $380 million and compares to savings of approximately $180 million in fiscal 2007. Approximately 92% of the savings come from reduced cost of services, while the remainder will be predominantly from lower selling, general and administrative costs. Savings are net of new or increased recurring costs, primarily the costs anticipated for an increasing offshore workforce. Savings are also impacted by certain transitional costs as new offshore staff are trained while outgoing staff are still on the payroll. Such transitional costs were $.3 and $4.1 million for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. A majority of the planned headcount reductions took place in Europe. For fiscal 2008, European headcount decreased by approximately 900 compared to 3,000 in fiscal 2007. Approximately 300 reductions were made in North America in fiscal 2008 compared to 1,100 in the prior year. The balance of the reductions occurred in Australia and Asia. Restructuring related pre tax cash payments for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were approximately $67.6 million, $180.4 million, and $207.2 million, respectively. Included in the restructuring charges are pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations, which will be paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions. Such liabilities are included in the consolidated pension liability account. See the following table for a summary of fiscal 2009 (in millions): Liability as of March 28, 2008 Less Payments Other(1) Restructuring liability as of April 3, 2009 Workforce reductions $ 61.3 $ (57.4 ) $ (1.7 ) $ 2.2 Other 32.8 (10.2 ) (4.6 ) 18.0 Total $ 94.1 $ (67.6 ) $ (6.3 ) $ 20.2 (1) Primarily foreign currency translation adjustments. Liability as of March 30, 2007 Total Pre tax Charges Less Payments Other(1) Restructuring liability as of March 28, 2008 Workforce reductions $ 93.5 $ 110.7 $ (150.9 ) $ 8.0 $ 61.3 Other 38.8 22.7 (29.5 ) 0.8 32.8 Total $ 132.3 $ 133.4 $ (180.4 ) $ 8.8 $ 94.1 (1) Primarily foreign currency translation adjustments. Other Expense/(Income) Dollars in millions 2009 2008 2007 Foreign currency loss /(gain) $ 25.2 $ (31.2 ) $ (45.5 ) (Gain)/loss on sale of non operating assets (1.8 ) (17.2 ) 4.2 Total Other Expense /(Income) $ 23.4 $ (48.4 ) $ (41.3 ) 39 The Company reported other expense of $23.4 million for fiscal 2009 compared with $48.4 million of other income in fiscal 2008 and $41.3 million of other income for fiscal 2007. Other expense/(income) is comprised primarily of foreign currency gains and losses on intra company balances and gains and losses on sale of non operating assets, as well as costs associated with the Companys hedging program. Of the reported $25.2 million currency loss in fiscal 2009, $15.0 million was due to hedging costs. The remaining loss of $10.2 million is due to the unhedged currency exposure. Foreign currency net gains and losses for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 were the result of the effect of currency rate movements, primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Australian dollar and between the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. The gain on sale of non operating assets during fiscal 2008 included the sale of a building in Austin, TX, in March for a gain of approximately $11.2 million pre tax and the sale of available for sale securities for a gain of approximately $4.4 million pre tax. Taxes The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was (17.5%), 40.7% and 34.5%, respectively. As a global enterprise, our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions and tax characteristics of our income. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. Our effective tax rate decreased for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 primarily due to a $370.5 million reduction in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, due to audit settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Company also filed accounting method changes during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and had settlements with certain state and foreign jurisdictions. The effective tax rate increased for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 due to the impact of income tax credits and the classification of tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense as a result of the adoption of FIN 48 on March 31, 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the foreign effective tax rates during fiscal year 2008, the remeasurement of tax, penalties and interest for tax matters relating to fiscal years 1995 to 1999, and changes in accounting methods. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, the IRS concluded its examination of the Companys consolidated U.S. tax returns for the fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The nature of the significant items subject to examination included depreciation and amortization, research credits and international tax issues. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2009, the Company also filed various accounting method changes with the IRS. As a result of the conclusion of the IRS examination and the filing of accounting method changes, the Company recorded reductions of approximately $929.3 million in the liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties. Of the reductions in liability for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties, approximately $370.5 million was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense. Additionally, $420.9 million, $143.9 million and $(6.0) million of uncertain tax positions were reclassified on the Companys balance sheet from liability for uncertain tax positions to deferred tax liabilities, taxes payable and other balance sheet accounts, respectively. As of April 3, 2009, the Companys liability for uncertain tax positions was $503.8 million, including interest of $81.3 million, penalties of $28.7 million and net of tax carryforwards of $49.4 million. During the year ended April 3, 2009, the Company accrued an interest benefit of $207.8 million ($128.7 million net of tax) and had a net release of penalties of $119.1 million. This interest amount includes the effect of new uncertain tax positions recognized in fiscal year 2009. On January 8, 2008, the Company paid a $100 million bond to the IRS related to certain tax matters. As a result, tax related interest for these tax matters stopped accruing as of the date of the bond payment. 40 A more detailed analysis of differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Earnings Per Share and Share Base Earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 increased $4.11 to $7.31 from $3.20 in fiscal 2008. EPS was favorably impacted by significantly higher net income and a decrease in the average share base of 17.6 million shares from fiscal 2008. The higher net income resulted from an increase in revenue of 1.5% and income before tax margin of 3.4% points compared to the prior year, as well as the $166.1 million tax benefit in fiscal 2009 versus tax expense of $373 million in fiscal 2008. Other significant contributing elements were fiscal 2008s special items and the change in other expense/(income) from year over year. The average share base reduction was due to the full year effect of the share purchase program and a reduction in the dilutive effect of stock options partially offset by the exercise of 2.1 million employee stock options during the prior year. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase transactions. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash Flows Dollars in millions Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Net cash from operations $ 1,986.4 $ 1,342.9 $ 1,578.6 Net cash used in investing (1,038.0 ) (2,718.7 ) (872.7 ) Net cash from/(used) in financing 742.1 997.9 (955.5 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (92.1 ) 26.7 9.0 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 1,598.4 (351.2 ) (240.6 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 698.9 1,050.1 1,290.7 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 2,297.3 $ 698.9 $ 1,050.1 The Company significantly increased its net cash balance during fiscal 2009. Operating cash flow increased $643.5 million for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher net income and higher collections of accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in income tax liabilities. Cash used in investing activities decreased $1.7 billion primarily due to the prior year acquisitions of Covansys Corporation and First Consulting Group which required a use of cash of $1.6 billion. Net cash provided by financing activities was $742.1 million, a decrease of $255.8 million with several offsetting factors described below. Operating Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities for fiscal 2009 of $1,986.4 million represents an increase of $643.5 million versus the prior year. Significant factors in these results are described below. A $570.6 million increase in net income. A reduction in receivables provided cash of $224.0 million in 2009. The reduction is primarily attributable to the Companys NPS and GOS operations resulting from a fiscal 2009 initiative to reduce DSO, as well as resolution of certain contract disputes and several contract completions. Increases in prepaid expenses and other assets required a use of cash of $164.1 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to work in progress on the Companys significant contract with the UK National Health Service (NHS). 41 Decreases in accounts payable and accruals required use of cash in fiscal 2009 of $322.5 million. The decrease primarily resulted from timing of BS&S Consulting subcontractor payments, and vendor payments in BS&S Other regions. Increases in deferred income and advance payments provided cash of $235.5 million for fiscal 2009. The increases primarily resulted from higher advances on the Companys engagement with NHS tied to expected activity levels. A decrease in income taxes payable and liability of cash of $820.1 million, included a non cash component for fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2009, the Company reached resolutions with the IRS and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As a result of these settlements, the Companys income tax payments decreased $172.7 million in fiscal 2009 to $323.1 million. Additionally, the settlements resulted in a non cash benefit related to the reduction of uncertain tax liabilities. Also impacting the fiscal 2009 comparison of operating cash flows to the prior year was $97.9 million of unrealized foreign currency losses compared to $27.3 million of gains for fiscal 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2008 of $1,342.9 million represents a decrease of $235.7 million versus fiscal 2007. Significant factors in these results included the following: For 2008, increases in receivables required a use of cash of $217.0 million, primarily from increases in unbilled receivables resulting from timing of work performed in GOS and long term contracts. A five day increase in Days Sales Outstanding for 2008 from 2007 was due to new business awards in Europe, increased unbilled on the NHS contract, and the dilutive nature of the mid year acquisitions during 2008. The cash flow impact of changes in prepaid expenses and other assets was a use of cash of $368.0 million for fiscal 2008. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was the result of increases in work in process balances for fiscal 2008 of $189 million, primarily in Europe and the payment of a $100 million bond to the IRS to stop the accrual of interest on certain tax liabilities. Activity in accounts payable and certain accrued expenses resulted in a use of cash of approximately $110 million during fiscal 2008. Accounts payable and certain accrued expenses decreased $381 million from the prior year due to the reversal of income tax related interest and penalties accrued under FAS 5 prior to fiscal 2008 and the accrual of the income tax related interest and penalties as a tax liability as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was partially offset in cash flow by an increase in accrued payroll of approximately $155.0 million primarily due to timing of payments. Activity in deferred income and advance payments provided cash inflow of approximately $87 million for fiscal 2008. The increase was related to advance contract payments in Europe and the United States as well as sales of software licenses. The cash flow impact from changes in income tax liabilities and assets was a cash inflow of approximately $130.0 million for fiscal 2008. Additions to taxes payable during fiscal 2008 were somewhat offset by payments to tax authorities during the year of approximately $496.0 million. 42 Investing Cash Flow The Companys capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software, and deferred outsourcing contract costs that have supported the Companys expanding GOS segment operations in prior years. Investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades, expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets. For cash flow presentation purposes, the Outsourcing Contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contracts acquisition or start up, including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets. Investing cash outflows decreased to $1,038.0 million during fiscal 2009 compared to $2,718.7 million for fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Covansys and FCG, which required a use of cash of $1.6 billion, as well as a $177.9 million reduction in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Investing cash outflows increased approximately $1.8 billion for fiscal 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Covansys and FCG. The remaining increase was driven by higher purchases of computer equipment and deferred outsourcing contracts costs of $191.0 million and $53.0 million, respectively. The increase in equipment was as a result of replacements on contracts in Europe and the United States while the increase in deferred outsourcing costs was as a result of new contracts in Europe and in the North American Public Sector. Future capital investments will depend on levels of new business and the mix of that business. Contracts in the NPS and BS&S segments typically require lower levels of initial investment compared to contracts in the GOS segment. Financing Cash Flow Cash provided by financing activities was $742.1 million for fiscal 2009 and a decrease of $255.8 million from fiscal 2008. The inflow was primarily due to a draw down on a $1.5 billion credit facility. CSC took this action to eliminate its reliance on the commercial paper market. Partially offsetting the financing cash inflows were repayments of $500 million of maturing long term debt, and repayment of commercial paper. Fiscal 2008 cash provided by financing activities increased $1.9 billion from the prior year. The inflow was primarily from the issuance of approximately $2.0 billion of commercial paper, $1.7 billion of which was refinanced with issuance of the $700 million 5.5% Senior Notes due 2013 and $1.0 billion 6.5% Senior Notes due 2018. This inflow was partially offset by outflows of $1.0 billion to acquire outstanding common stock. Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $2,297.3 million at April 3, 2009, and $698.9 million at March 28, 2008, and $1,050.1 million at March 30, 2007. During fiscal 2009, shareholders equity increased $48.1 million. The positive impact of net earnings of $1,115.2 million was largely offset by two negative factors. First, foreign currency translation movements caused a $637.5 million decrease as the U.S. dollar strengthened sharply. Second, the company recorded an unfunded pension obligation increase, reducing accumulated other comprehensive income by $467.0 million. Recognition of stock based compensation expense and stock option exercises added $65.9 million to stockholders equity. At the end of fiscal 2009, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 43.5%, up from 38.9% at the end of fiscal 2008, and from 21.4% at the end of fiscal 2007. The increase in the debt ratio for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of the draw down of the $1.5 billion line of credit. 43 The increase in the debt ratio for fiscal 2008 was the result of (1) the issuance of $1.7 billion of commercial paper which was converted into long term notes during fiscal 2008 to fund the acquisitions of Covansys and FCG, (2) the issuance of approximately $263 million of commercial paper during the fourth quarter to fund the completion of the 10b5 1 share repurchase plan, and (3) the decrease in shareholders equity resulting from the 10b5 1 share repurchase. The following table summarizes the Companys debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year ends 2009, 2008 and 2007. Dollars in millions April 3, 2009 March 28, 2008 March 30, 2007 Debt $ 4,234.5 $ 3,473.7 $ 1,505.9 Equity 5,509.9 5,461.8 5,540.0 Total capitalization $ 9,744.4 $ 8,935.5 $ 7,045.9 Debt to total capitalization 43.5 % 38.9 % 21.4 % During fiscal 2008, the Company purchased and retired approximately 24.3 million outstanding common shares through a 10b5 1 share repurchase plan approved by the Companys Board of Directors at a cost of approximately $1.03 billion. This transaction was financed through available cash on hand and the issuance of approximately $263.0 million of commercial paper which is no longer outstanding. At April 3, 2009, the Company had $32.1 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $29.8 million of current maturities and $4,172.6 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 3, 2009. At March 28, 2008, the Company had $309.5 million of short term borrowings, $528.9 million of current maturities of long term debt and $2,635.3 million of long term debt. As further described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, commercial paper is classified as short term borrowings. The Company had $262.9 million of outstanding commercial paper as of March 28, 2008. On July 12, 2007, the Company entered into a new committed line of credit providing $1.5 billion of long term commercial paper backup. The line of credit expires on July 12, 2012. On October 22, 2008, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion under the line of credit. The proceeds from the drawdown of the line of credit were used primarily to repay maturing commercial paper and repay $200 million of maturing debt. The Company discontinued its issuance of commercial paper after October 22, 2008, and as of April 3, 2009, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. This line requires the Company to (1) limit liens placed on our assets to $100 million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business; (2) maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00; the Company is in full compliance with these requirements; and (3) not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. As of April 3, 2009, the Companys total liquidity was approximately $2.3 billion which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of April 3, 2009, the Company had $1.5 billion borrowed under the 2012 credit facility and was in compliance with all terms of the agreement. Liquidity Risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk from operations and from the Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets. 44 The Companys exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the Companys performance as well as customer acceptance. An example is the contract with the United Kingdoms NHS to deliver an integrated electronic patient records system with an announced value of 2.9 billion ($5.4 billion). This is a large and complex contract. As of April 3, 2009, the Company had a net investment in the contract of approximately $549 million. Contract assets consist principally of contract work in progress and unbilled receivables but also equipment, software and other assets. These are partially offset by liabilities for deferred revenue and advanced payments. The contract is profitable and the Company expects to recover its investment; however, unforeseen future events to the extent they add costs beyond those included in the Companys current estimated costs to complete, could potentially adversely impact such recovery and the Companys liquidity. The Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the Companys financial position. The Company was successful in issuing $1.7 billion of long term debt as a private placement under rule 144A during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This debt was then converted to publicly traded debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities and cash balances. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company was able to access the debt capital markets utilizing a Rule 144A offering, as noted above, which was then converted to publicly traded debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. However, there can be no assurances the Company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of April 3, 2009: Dollars in millions Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 & thereafter Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 32.5 $ 0.1 $ 32.6 Letters of credit 558.6 15.4 2.4 576.4 Standby letters of credit 72.1 0.2 4.4 76.7 Foreign subsidiary debt guarantees 639.5 639.5 Total $ 1,302.7 $ 15.6 $ 6.9 $ 1,325.2 See Note 9 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 45 The following table summarizes the Companys payments on contractual obligations by period as of April 3, 2009: Dollars in millions Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Long term debt $ 1,999.2 $ 995.8 $ 996.2 $ 3,991.2 Interest on fixed rate debt $ 155.4 281.5 179.9 257.3 874.1 Capital lease obligations 26.9 45.1 21.0 101.4 194.4 Bank debt 32.1 32.1 Operating leases 282.3 352.6 194.1 76.9 905.9 Minimum purchase obligations 296.6 287.1 583.7 Other long term liabilities 2.9 7.6 4.5 1.8 16.8 Total $ 796.2 $ 2,973.1 $ 1,395.3 $ 1,433.6 $ 6,598.2 The Company adopted FIN 48 on March 31, 2007. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Regarding minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities. The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall. The above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company has numerous plans, both inside and outside of the U.S., and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis. The minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors, and can be zero in some years. Funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including ERISA and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) applied to U.S. government contracts. While there are certain minimum contribution requirements, CSC may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments, changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts. During fiscal 2010, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $95.0 million to pension and $10.0 million postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal 2010 because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In fiscal 2009 Company pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to $221.4 million, a decrease of $24.1 million from $245.5 million in fiscal 2008. See Note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Dividends and Redemption It has been the Companys policy to invest earnings in the growth of the Company rather than distribute earnings as dividends. This policy, under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal 1969, is expected to continue, but is subject to review by the Board of Directors. 46 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues. Changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. We have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates relate to: revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill; assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition The majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates. Revenue from our fixed unit price contracts, time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time. However, for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting, which is less than eight percent of the Companys revenues, the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation. Under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved. Costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved. The method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. Modifications to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. We routinely negotiate such contract modifications. 47 Many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers. The total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value. These relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value. Once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements, revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered. Estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume difference, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception. Revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization If significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results. Capitalization of outsourcing contract costs Certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set up costs, and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets (premiums). Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion, to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues. Capitalization of software development costs We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations. 48 Estimates used to determine income tax expense We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We also must analyze income tax reserves, as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination. Assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill We account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments in our determination of acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include target integration liabilities as well as litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining their fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations can be based on significant estimates provided by the Company, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual results versus estimates, could result in material impacts to earnings. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and reductions in growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting units fair value to its carrying value. If a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment of goodwill may exist. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method. In applying the discounted cash flow method, the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a weighted average cost of capital. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, the Company applied discount rates ranging from 10 13%, based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit. The Companys cash flow projections also incorporate managements estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. 49 The fair values of reporting units estimated under the income approach are assessed by comparing those values to fair value estimates derived using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting units operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. If the fair value of the reporting unit derived in the market approach is significantly different from the fair value estimated in the income approach, the Company reevaluates and, if necessary, adjusts the assumptions used in the income approach. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step of the impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. See discussion of fiscal 2009 goodwill impairment charge in the Results of Operations section in this Managements Discussion and Analysis as well as Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, the Companys stock price was subject to significant fluctuation, which the Company believes is due to the uncertainty related to the global economy and overall stock market volatility. As a result, the Companys market capitalization was frequently less than its net book value during the third and fourth quarters. At January 2, 2009, the Company evaluated all relevant factors and determined an interim impairment test was not necessary. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company undertook its fiscal 2010 budgeting process and at the end of the quarter, having substantially completed its budgeting process, determined that the expected cash flows for certain reporting units were significantly less than the estimated cash flows utilized in the fiscal 2009 annual impairment test. Management concluded these factors were a triggering event indicating potential impairment and performed an impairment test of goodwill as of April 3, 2009. Based on the results of the step one interim impairment test, there was an indication that an impairment may exist for one reporting unit (CSA) and the second step was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment for CSA goodwill was determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. Based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded an $18.9 million goodwill impairment charge, equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the CSA reporting unit. There were no other significant intangible assets attributed to the CSA reporting unit nor were any other long lived assets attributable to that reporting unit determined to be impaired. The reporting unit fair values determined in the step one income approach were used to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The Company performed a reconciliation of the enterprise value for the reporting units to the Companys market capitalization and concluded that the fair value results determined for the reporting units were reasonable. The estimated market capitalization considers recent trends in market capitalization and an expected control premium, based on comparable transactional history. 50 Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal growth rates, capital expenditures, as well as discount rates. Estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit. Although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain and can vary from actual results. In light of current economic conditions, additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the reporting units fair values would result in no additional reporting units failing step one. Assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities We offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, as amended by SFAS No. 158 for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. In making these assumptions, we are required to consider current market conditions, including changes in interest rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan, the asset mix of the plan, historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors. The weighted average of the expected long term rates of return, for all plans, on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2009 pension plan valuations was 7.8% compared to 7.9% used in fiscal 2008. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the net periodic pension cost by approximately $18.6 million. An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal 2009 pension plan valuations was 6.2% compared to 5.5% used for fiscal 2008. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately $27.5 million, or increased it by approximately $39.4 million, respectively. Some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts. The accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year. Such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time. For CSC, market returns caused actual pension plan asset returns to lag those expected in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Rising discount rates in fiscal 2009, which resulted in lower benefit obligation growth, served to offset the negative impact of poor asset returns for fiscal 2009. Rising discount rates in fiscal 2008 and 2007, which resulted in lower calculated benefit obligation growth, served to partially enhance the impact of positive asset returns in fiscal 2008 and 2007. 51 For fiscal 2009 and 2008, SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of a pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the projected benefit obligation (PBO) at the end of the year. At the end of fiscal 2009, a number of our pension plans had PBOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, due mostly to poor pension asset performance, higher pension obligations were recognized in 2009 than in 2008. The effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal 2009 was to increase pension liability by $626.8 million, decrease non current asset by $21.8 million, and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by $686.9 million ($446.1 million net of taxes). For fiscal 2008, a number of our pension plans had PBOs in excess of their plan assets fair value. However, due to higher discount rates, lower pension obligations were recognized in 2008 than in 2007. The effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal 2008 was to decrease pension liability by $291.2 million, increase non current asset by $14.6 million, and decrease accumulated comprehensive loss by $236.6 million ($171.7 million net of taxes). Based on future plan asset performance and interest rates, additional charges to equity might be required. Assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation We are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt. Foreign Currency As a large global organization the Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received. Short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. By generally matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. However, as the Company has increased its use of offshore support it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations. 52 The Company established policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year. In addition, the Company uses these instruments as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes. For accounting purposes, these foreign currency contracts do not qualify as cash flow hedges and all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expenses. In fiscal year 2009, the Company entered into foreign currency options to manage their exposure to the economic risk from movements in the Rupee against the U.S. dollar from the Companys offshore support base in India. During fiscal 2009, 38.4% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. In order to provide an assessment of the Companys foreign currency exchange rate risk, the Company uses sensitivity analysis to determine the effects on the fair value of our hedge portfolio. Given a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies, revenue would decrease by 3.84% or $643.5 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 3.84% or $643.5 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by $56.8 million. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. At April 3, 2009, the Company had approximately $1,216.1 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $32.1 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 53
