Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations GENERAL The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and associated notes for the year ended April 2, 2010. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: 1) Provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; 2) Enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes, providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed; and 3) Provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. To achieve these objectives, the discussion is presented in the following sections: Overviewincludes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash, as well as a discussion of the economic and industry factors, key business drivers, key performance indicators, fiscal 2010 highlights, and fiscal 2011 commentary. Results of Operationsdiscusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal 2008 to 2010, describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and currency impacts, and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories. Financial Conditiondiscusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the Companys liquidity and available capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimatesdiscusses accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. OVERVIEW CSC provides information technology and business process outsourcing, consulting and systems integration services and other professional services to its customers. The Company targets the delivery of these services within three sectors: North American Public Sector (NPS), Managed Services Sector (MSS), and Business Solutions and Services (BSS). The Companys organization has continued to evolve, and management decided to consolidate and streamline the management and reporting structure. At the start of fiscal 2010, the Company changed its internal organization structure, including a change to further strengthen market position by consolidating its application management services business, including all offshore activity, within its managed services sector. The Companys reportable segments for fiscal 2010 parallel the three lines of business and are as follows: North American Public Sector (NPS) The NPS segment operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations, Cost Accounting Standards and audits by various U.S. federal and state and local agencies. For fiscal 2009, NPS was treated as a reportable segment and continues to be a reportable segment for fiscal 2010. 21 Managed Services Sector (MSS) The MSS segment provides large scale outsourcing solutions offerings as well as midsize services delivery to customers globally. For fiscal 2009, Global Outsourcing Services (GOS) was considered a separate operating and reportable segment. During fiscal 2010, the name of the segment was changed to Managed Services Sector; and the Applications and Technology Services (ATS) unit was moved from the Business Solutions & Services Other (BS&S Other) segment to MSS due to the fact that its services, particularly its applications management, are more aligned with the Companys outsourcing services rather than consulting services. ATS results are no longer reported separately to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) but are included with the MSS segment. Business Solutions & Services (BSS) The BSS segment provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services, business process outsourcing, and intellectual property (IP) based software solutions. For fiscal 2009, there were three reportable segments: BS&S Consulting, BS&S Financial Services and BS&S Other. As a result of the reorganization in fiscal 2010, the BSS line of service is now a single operating segment with one sector president reporting to the CODM, and financial information is provided on a sector level only. Based on this change, BSS is considered a reportable segment for fiscal 2010. Furthermore, most of the India operating segment, which was part of the BS&S Other segment in fiscal 2009, has been moved to the MSS operating segment and renamed ATS as discussed above. See Note 14 Segment and Geographic Information within Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. Economic and Industry Factors The Companys results of operations are impacted by economic conditions generally, including macroeconomic conditions. We are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us. A severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate. This may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations. Particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty, we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations. Our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve, as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance. Revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients. Our ability to add value to clients, and therefore generate revenues, depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. The BSS and MSS segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on information technology (IT) projects. CSC is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors, including service offerings and flexibility. Management monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. Outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships. Long term, complex outsourcing contracts, including their consulting components, require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work, in order to meet clients evolving business needs and our performance expectations. 22 The NPS segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract is terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed. Shifting priorities of the U.S. government can also impact the future of projects. Management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts, legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professio nal associations. Business Drivers Revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more. Factors affecting revenue include the Companys ability to successfully: bid on and win new contract awards, satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes, compete on services offered, technical ability, experience and flexibility, identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues, and manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations. Earnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and, in addition, the Companys ability to: control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs, anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses, accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals, and develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore. Cash flows are affected by the above earnings factors and, in addition, by the following factors: timely management of receivables and payables, investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions, dispositions and large outsourcing contracts, and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments. Key Performance Indicators The Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue growth, margins, cash flow and return on investment. New contract winsIn addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the Companys ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or re competed contracts, as well as numerous external factors. CSC employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts. 23 Revenue growthYear over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth. MarginsMargins reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations. Cash flow Primary drivers of the Companys cash flow are earnings provided by the Companys operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings. Also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances. The Company also regularly reviews the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements of operating, investing and financing cash flows, as well as the non GAAP measure free cash flow. Return on investment (ROI)ROI is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization. A combination of strong margins (measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue) and investment base turnover (measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital) is required to generate sufficient returns on capital. Strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns. Fiscal 2010 Highlights In fiscal 2010s difficult economic environment, the Company delivered significant revenue, pre tax profit, net income, earnings per share and cash flow from operations. The Company continues to focus on margins and cash flow by improvements to productivity and cost management. Key operating results for fiscal 2010 include: Revenues decreased $612 million or 3.7%, while decreasing 3.8% on a constant currency basis. Income before taxes of $1,038 million was up $81 million, or 8.5%. Net income of $834 million was down $289 million or 25.7% due to a $370 million change in taxes on income from a $166 million benefit in fiscal 2009 to a $204 million expense in fiscal 2010. Earnings per share of $5.28 were down $2.03, or 27.7% on a diluted basis, also driven by the tax benefit in 2009. The Company announced contract awards of $19.2 billion including new MSS segment awards of $8.7 billion, NPS segment awards of $7.1 billion, and BSS segment awards of $3.4 billion. Free cash flow of $811 million in fiscal 2010 was 97.2% of net income attributable to CSC common shareholders and down from $1,021 million in fiscal 2009, driven primarily by lower operating cash flows, including higher pension contributions of $124 million.(1) DSO was 80 days at April 2, 2010, an improvement from 84 days at April 3, 2009.(2) 24 Debt to total capitalization ratio was 36.5% at year end, a decrease of 6.5 percentage points from 43.0% at fiscal 2009 year end, reflecting the pay down of debt. (3) ROI was 9.9% for the year, down from 14.9% in fiscal 2009, a change driven significantly by fiscal 2009 tax benefits. (4) (1) The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure: Twelve Months Ended (In millions) April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 March 28, 2008 Free cash flow $ 811 $ 1,021 $ 175 Net cash used in investing activities 790 1,038 2,719 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (5 ) (100 ) (1,591 ) Business dispositions 14 Capital lease payments 33 27 40 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,643 $ 1,986 $ 1,343 Net cash used in investing activities $ (790 ) $ (1,038 ) $ (2,719 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (487 ) $ 742 $ 998 The reader should note free cash flow is a non GAAP measure and the Companys definition of such measure may differ from other companies. We define free cash flow as equal to the sum of (1) operating cash flows, (2) investing cash flows, excluding business acquisitions, dispositions and purchase or sale of available for sale securities, and (3) capital lease payments. CSCs free cash flow measure does not distinguish operating cash flows from investing cash flows as they are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating and investing cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is one of the factors CSC management uses in reviewing the overall performance of the business. Management compensates for the limita tions of this non GAAP measure by also reviewing the GAAP measures of operating, investing and financing cash flows as well as debt levels measured by the debt to total capitalization ratio. (2) CSC calculates DSO as follows: DSO is calculated as total receivables at fiscal period end divided by revenue per day. Revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the fiscal quarter. Total receivables include unbilled receivables but exclude tax receivables and long term receivables. (3) Debt to total capitalization is defined as total current and long term debt divided by total debt and equity, including noncontrolling interest. (4) ROI is calculated by multiplying profit margin by the investment base turnover. The profit margin used is a) the last four quarters adjusted net income available to CSC common shareholders (net income available to CSC common shareholders adjusted to exclude interest expense and special items, net of their corresponding tax effects), divided by b) the last four quarters revenues. Investment base turnover equals the last four quarters revenues divided by average debt and equity during the last four quarters. It should be noted that the adjusted net income figure available to CSC common shareholders is not identical to net income available to CSC common shareholders as determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and is therefore reconciled to the GAAP measure in the table below. The Companys calculation of ROI may not be comparable with other companies measures using the same or similar terms. Management compensates for any limitations of this non GAAP measure by reviewing a number of metrics, including GAAP measures such as EPS, operating and investing cash flows, and the debt to total capitalization ratio. Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation Twelve Months Ended (Amounts in millions) April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 Adjusted Net Income $ 1,019 $ 1,421 Less: Interest expense 252 260 Special items Tax effect of Interest Expense and Special Items (50 ) 46 Net Income attributable to CSC as Reported $ 817 $ 1,115 25 The Companys significant wins and scope extensions during fiscal 2010 included the following: NPS: Defense ($3.7 billion) Civil ($2.2 billion) Department of Homeland Security ($1.0 billion) MSS: Zurich Financial ($2.9 billion) UTC ($1.5 billion) Raytheon ($1.4 billion) Public sector clients ($693 million) Chemical, energy, and natural resources industry clients ($509 million) BSS: Financial services industry clients ($1.1 billion) Technology and consumer industry clients ($629 million) Health services industry clients ($458 million) NPS has announced values for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) awards that represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract. The bookings value of MSS announced awards are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates and include optional contract years. The announced values for the BSS line of business awards are based on firm commitments. The Company has developed a broad, long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines. A significant amount of CSCs revenue is derived from long term contracts including information technology outsourcing, build and maintain engagements and U.S. federal government engagements. This provides the Company with a base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens. Cash and cash equivalents at April 2, 2010, was nearly $2.8 billion, up from $2.3 billion at April 3, 2009, a $487 million increase. The increase was a result of $1.6 billion cash proceeds from operating activities during fiscal 2010, offset by investing and financing cash outflows of $790 million and $487 million, respectively. Net income drove the operating cash inflows, and capital expenditures and an early debt retirement drove the investing and financing outflows. Cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion at April 3, 2009, were up from approximately $700 million at March 28, 2008, a $1.6 billion increase. The increase resulted from $2.0 billion of cash proceeds from operating activities and $742 million from financing activities, offset by investing cash outflows of $1.0 billion. Operating cash inflows were driven by net income, financing inflows were primarily a result of a fiscal 2009 draw down of a credit facility, and investing outflows were driven by capital expenditures. 26 Fiscal 2011 Commentary As the macroeconomic environment signals signs of recovery, CSC is well positioned to provide a broad portfolio of services to public and private sector clients. The recovery is expected to vary by geography, and industry, and will provide different rates of growth for the Companys Lines of Business. Overall, CSC anticipates revenue growth in the range of 4 7% for fiscal year 2011. CSC will also continue to focus on cost control and cash flow performance during the upcoming fiscal year. As a leading federal contractor, and one of the top IT service providers to the U.S. federal government, CSCs NPS segment is well positioned to benefit from government demand for IT services. The market trend in public sector continues to be positive with increased budgets in place for government fiscal year 2010, and with few exceptions, increased budgets for the government fiscal year 2011 (based upon President Obamas recent budget submission). Defense, Intelligence, and Homeland Security budgets remain intact with continued opportunities for growth, consistent with the ongoing pace of military operational activity. The outlook for Defense spending, particularly in the areas of intelligence agency support, logistics systems support, modernization and reset and cybersecurity are positive. Additionally, there are increasing opportunities across the Civil and Health sectors as the administration continues to implement its agenda. However, the Company expects that the procurement environment will continue to become increasingly complex, driven by new requirements for transparency, insourcing, and new guidelines on organizational conflicts of interest. Contract protests continue to delay many, key government procurements. Overall, CSC anticipates growth in the NPS segment to be at or above the fiscal 2010 level, benefiting from the $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion in bookings in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds and project assignments can vary, the Company expects broad IT and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government. The Company expects the global commercial market to continue to recover during fiscal year 2011. MSS had a strong fiscal year 2010 in bookings of $8.7 billion (compared to 2009 of $5.1 billion). This provides a base of significant outsourcing contracts, which the Company expects will continue to provide a stable revenue stream during fiscal 2011 in this segment. However, growth from this revenue stream is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and the resulting pressure on prices, as well as volatility in demand for short term projects and other contract concl usions. Overall, the Company is seeing improvements in the opportunity pipeline in the commercial sector providing an encouraging sign that clients are returning to transformational agendas. CSC anticipates both MSS and BSS will achieve growth targets by continuing to focus on higher growth market segments including applications, cloud, and cybersecurity; bringing advanced solutions to market; and expanding the Companys utilization in low cost delivery centers. Currency exchange movements continue to be a major influence on results and the Company is unable to predict future currency exchange rates. In addition to anticipated revenue growth, management intends to continue its focus on operating income margin in fiscal 2011. Management of SG&A and other overhead costs, as well as continuing utilization of offshore and near shore low cost centers, is expected to provide margin growth in combination with margin improvement from increased revenue. CSC will also continue its focus on cash management. Fiscal 2010 cash flow benefited from a four day improvement in DSO. The Companys free cash flow can be impacted by realized gains or losses on foreign currency hedging programs. Such gains or losses are dependent on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates which the Company is unable to predict. Overall, the Company continues to target free cash flow to be in excess 90% of net income attri butable to CSC common shareholders. 27 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues Revenues for the NPS, MSS, and BSS segments for fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008 are as follows: Twelve Months Ended April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 March 28, 2008 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount NPS $ 6,225 4.1 % $ 5,978 3.4 % $ 5,781 MSS 6,451 (6.8 ) 6,922 (1.9 ) 7,059 BSS 3,560 (9.8 ) 3,946 4.6 3,771 Corporate 17 17 17 Subtotal 16,253 (3.6 ) 16,863 1.4 16,628 Eliminations (125 ) (123 ) (128 ) Total Revenue $ 16,128 (3.7 ) $ 16,740 1.5 $ 16,500 See Note 14 Segment and Geographic Information within Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. The major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows: Twelve Months Ended April 2, 2010 vs. April 3, 2009 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total NPS 0.3 % 3.8 % 4.1 % MSS (1.1 %) (5.7 ) (6.8 %) BSS 0.8 2.4 (13.0 ) (9.8 %) Cumulative Net Percentage 0.3 % 0.1 % (4.1 %) (3.7 %) Twelve Months Ended April 3, 2009 vs. March 28, 2008 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total NPS 0.2 % 3.2 % 3.4 % MSS 2.3 (4.7 %) 0.5 (1.9 ) BSS 4.3 (3.5 ) 3.8 4.6 Cumulative Net Percentage 2.1 % (2.8 %) 2.2 % 1.5 28 North American Public Sector The Companys North American Public Sector segment revenues were derived from the following sources: Twelve Months Ended April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 March 28, 2008 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount Department of Defense $ 4,594 9.3 % $ 4,204 9.0 % $ 3,857 Civil agencies 1,423 (11.9 ) 1,615 (6.8 ) 1,733 Other (1) 208 30.8 159 (16.8 ) 191 Total $ 6,225 4.1 % $ 5,978 3.4 % $ 5,781 (1) Other revenues consist of foreign, state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the NPS segment. Fiscal 2010 NPS segment revenue increased 4.1%, or $247 million, for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenues from major new contracts contributed 4.5% or $269 million, including a field operations contract that commenced in the first quarter and contributed 3.0%, or $177 million. Revenue also increased 1.1% from a claim settlement of $65 million, and 0.3%, or $19 million from acquisitions. Revenue was offset 1.1% or $67 million from one extra week that was included in fiscal 2009. Revenue from civil agencies declined $192 million, primarily the result of contract conclusions and reduced funding on certain contracts with various civil agencies. Delays in funding and contract completions on various EPA contracts accounted for $65 million. An IRS contract reduction contributed $50 million. The additional week included in fiscal 2009 contributed $30 million of the civil agencies year over year decline. Revenue decline was only partially offset by new business revenue on other civil agency contracts in fiscal 2010. Revenue from other sources increased $49 million primarily from a state contract that commenced late in fiscal 2009 and contributed $38 million in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, the Company announced federal contract awards with a total value of $7.1 billion compared to $7.3 billion during fiscal 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2009 NPS segment revenue increased $197 million or 3.4% to $5,978 million for fiscal 2009. The revenue growth was the result of new business awarded during fiscal 2009 and 2008, increases on existing Department of Defense contracts, and an acquisition. The acquisition of a logistics engineering business contributed $14 million to revenue growth for fiscal 2009. This growth was partially offset by revenue reductions due to concluding contracts and reductions on other programs. NPS announced new U.S. business awards of $7.3 billion during fiscal 2009. 29 Department of Defense revenue increased $347 million or 9.0% to $4,204 million for fiscal 2009. Growth was the result of new contracts for analysis, engineering, surveillance and reconnaissance support for the U.S. Army. The Company benefited from significant contracts involving the expansion of a field operations contract and strategic planning and management for the Missile Defense Agency. The Company also benefited from new contracts to provide application hosting, system engineering, software development, and web applications services for an intelligence contract. Under a task order valued at $369 million, the Company also engaged in professional services support for the Naval Sea Systems Engineering Directorate. This growth was partially offset by the end of certain programs. Civil agencies revenue decreased $118 million, or 6.8%, versus fiscal 2008, primarily as a result of reduced activity and the end of certain programs with NASA. Other NPS revenue decreased $32 million, or 16.8%, versus fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily the result of client budget constraints and delayed commitments from clients. Managed Services Sector Fiscal 2010 MSS segment revenue declined $471 million, 6.8% in fiscal 2010, or 5.7 % excluding foreign currency effects of $74 million. Revenue decreased 5.1%, or $352 million, primarily from a lower level of projects in excess of contract baseline volumes, mainly in the Americas, as well as reduced scope and volume at some key clients. Other declines were generally related to conclusions of smaller contracts totaling 3.9%, or $268 million. Revenue declines were partially offset by new account growth, mainly in the Americas, of 3.2%, or $223 million. During fiscal 2010, the Company announced contract awards with a total value of $8.7 billion compared to $5.1 billion during fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 MSS segment revenue declined $137 million in fiscal 2009, or 1.9%, but was up 2.8% when excluding foreign currency effects of over $330 million. On a constant currency basis, the increase was primarily the result of the full year impact of the fiscal 2008 acquisition of Covansys, which provided approximately $148 million of revenue growth. MSS also had increased revenue in Europe ($54 million), Australia ($24 million) and Asia ($27 million), which were offset by declines in North America ($58 million). The higher international revenue was due to the full year effects of new fiscal 2008 contracts as well as scope extensions on others. European growth of $210 million was mostly offset by the impact of renegotiating terms of certain existing contracts and contract conclusions totaling $156 million. I n North America, contract conclusions of $202 million and scope reductions on existing contracts of $54 million more than offset new fiscal 2009 and annualized fiscal 2008 contract awards of $153 million and the full year impact of the fiscal 2008 FCG acquisition of $46 million. Business Solutions & Services Fiscal 2010 BSS segment revenue declined $386 million, or 9.8% in fiscal 2010, but 12.2% excluding foreign currency effects of $95 million as compared to fiscal 2009. The decreased revenues, excluding the currency effect, included 5.4% or $212 million from core consulting operations, 2.2% or $88 million from the sale of a business in Hong Kong, 1.5% or $59 million from an extra week in fiscal 2009, 1.2% or $49 million from milestone delays associated with the National Health Service (NHS) contract in the United Kingdom, and 0.8% or $32 million due to project reductions. Partially offsetting these revenue declines was 0.7% or $28 million from the acquisition of a foreign consulting business. 30 During fiscal 2010, BSS had contract awards of $3.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion during fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 BSS segment revenue increased $175 million, or 4.6% in fiscal 2009, but 8.1% excluding the effect of currency as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of the January 2008 acquisition of First Consulting Group (FCG) which contributed approximately $135 million of growth during fiscal 2009. A slight drop in remaining North American operations was due to a decrease in staff utilization rates which were only partially offset by improved billing rates. European operations primarily comprised the remainder of the consulting revenue increase, despite adverse currency movements. The higher growth came from new project work as well as increased scope at existing customers. While the achievement of revenue milestones on the NHS contract resulted in year over year growth in loca l currency, revenue was down slightly on NHS after the effect of currency. BSS revenue was primarily offset by reduced credit reporting and consulting services in the Americas and lower license sales and consulting services in Europe. Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Twelve Months Ended Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization) $ 12,797 $ 13,268 $ 13,150 79.3 % 79.3 % 79.7 % Selling, general and administrative 991 1,083 975 6.1 6.5 5.9 Depreciation and amortization 1,097 1,186 1,199 6.8 7.1 7.3 Goodwill impairment 19 0.1 Interest expense, net 225 219 148 1.4 1.3 0.9 Special items 156 0.9 Other (income)/expense (20 ) 8 (60 ) (0.1 ) (0.4 ) Total $ 15,090 $ 15,783 $ 15,568 93.5 % 94.3 % 94.3 % Fiscal 2010 Historically, the Company has substantially matched revenues and costs in the same currency. However, the Company is increasing its use of offshore support and therefore is increasingly exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2010 improved to 93.5% from 94.3% in fiscal 2009. Cost of services (COS) was flat in fiscal 2010 as the Company aligned these expenses with revenue declines. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense ratio decreased 0.4%, which was a result of reduced headcount, lower bid and proposal costs, and cost reduction initiatives. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) ratio improved 0.3% from reduced capital spending and intangible asset amortization. Other income of $20 million was primarily due to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and miscellaneous gains from the sale of the Companys former headquarters and a prior year business disposition, partially offset by foreign currency losses. 31 Fiscal 2009 Costs and expenses remained flat as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Offsetting a cost of services ratio decrease of 0.4% in fiscal 2009 was a selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense ratio increase of 0.6%, which was a result of relatively higher marketing and branding costs, development of new service offerings, relocation of the Companys headquarters, client targeting, and increased amounts charged to allowance for doubtful accounts. The depreciation and amortization ratio declined slightly due to less capital expenditure. The interest expense ratio increased as a result of fiscal 2008s fourth quarter term debt offering to replace c ommercial paper and the drawdown of the credit facility during fiscal 2009. The Company also incurred a goodwill impairment charge as further described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other (income)/expense of $8 million was primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses. In fiscal 2008, the Company had net gains in foreign currency and also had gains from the sale of non operating assets. Costs of Services Fiscal 2010 Costs of services as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 79.3% for fiscal 2010, primarily driven by matching revenue declines with cost reduction measures. BSS Americas region, which experienced increased COS ratios in the healthcare services and global consulting, offset the improvements in NPS and MSS ratios, as NPS and MSS had larger percentages of sales of the consolidated Company than fiscal 2009. The NPS segment ratio for fiscal 2010 improved from changes in estimated profitability on two contracts netting to $35 million, and curtailment of certain pension benefits of $7 million. In the MSS segment, improvements in CSC India were driven by cost reductions, efficiencies, and by the weakening rupee during fiscal 2010, which reduced costs on US dollar denominated contracts. Fiscal 2009 COS as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.4% points to 79.3% for fiscal 2009, primarily driven by improvements in the MSS and NPS segments. MSS operations in Europe benefited from the prior years restructuring program as well as improved performance on certain large accounts. The improvements in Europe more than offset higher costs as a percentage of revenue in the MSS Americas region, which were driven primarily from impairments of approximately $26 million for deferred contract and other costs associated with two contracts. The NPS segment ratio for fiscal 2009 improved as fiscal 2008s results included charges on a fixed price contract with the IRS of $42 million. Absent the fiscal 2008 charge, the ratio was virtually unchanged. In the MSS segment, improvements in CSC India were driven primarily by the weakening of the rupee during fiscal 2009 which reduced costs on US dollar denominated contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal 2010 Selling, general and administrative expense declined 0.4% as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The NPS ratio increased 0.1 percentage point from additional legal fees and acquisition costs. Ongoing MSS and BSS cost reduction actions were the primary driver of the improved SG&A as a percentage of revenue, including decreases in headcount, salaries, benefits, and legal fees, as well as movement of certain administrative functions to lower cost geographies. Improvements were primarily in the European region and across the financial services operations of the BSS segment. Offsetting these improvements were increases in the SG&A rat io in other segment regions as revenue decreased faster than cost reductions. 32 Fiscal 2009 SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 0.6 percentage points to 6.5% for fiscal 2009 primarily due to increases in Corporate and MSS segment SG&A. MSS SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. The higher MSS costs were driven by increases in allowances for bad debt expense, business development expenses, customer relationship management, and costs incurred to introduce the new CSC brand in Europe. The customer relationship costs and branding efforts were part of the Companys roll out of Project Accelerate in fiscal 2009. Corporate G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 0. 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008, and related to the roll out of the new CSC brand and costs incurred to relocate the Companys headquarters. Partly offsetting the higher SG&A cost percentages was an improvement of 0.2 percentage points in the NPS segment. Depreciation and Amortization Fiscal 2010 Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.3 percentage points to 6.8% of revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The D&A ratio improved slightly in NPS, which had a lower than average ratio of 2.1% and 2.3% in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, and which had a larger proportionate share of revenues year over year from 36% up to 39%. The NPS and MSS improvements resulted from reductions in capital expenditures, and reduced amortization of transition costs and customer intangibles. The ratio improvement was offset by slightly higher ratios in BSS as revenue decreased faster than expenses. Fiscal 2009 D&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.2 percentage points to 7.1% during fiscal 2009. The primary driver for the decrease was a favorable mix shift towards a lower revenue volume in MSS relative to the other segments. MSS D&A as a percentage of revenue is in excess of 12% as compared to the consolidated average of 7.1% and 7.3% in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. As MSS revenue declined from 43% of total CSC revenue in fiscal 2008 to 41% in fiscal 2009, the consolidated D&A percentage of revenue improved accordingly. The expense ratio also improved slightly in NPS, which had a lower than average ratio of 2.3% and 2.6% in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively, and which had a larger proportionate share of revenues year over year from 35% up to 36%. The NPS improvement resulted from reductions in capital expenditures, and r educed amortization of transition costs and customer intangibles. BSS had improved performance as D&A improved from 4.3% to 4.1% of revenues, primarily driven by lower amortization on internally developed software and the absence of fiscal 2009 depreciation on a building sold at the end of fiscal 2008. Goodwill Impairment Fiscal 2010 and 2009 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in our second quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 (SFAS No. 142), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 33 In the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2009, the Company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, due to factors such as stock price fluctuation, uncertainty in the global economy, and the expected cash flows for certain reporting units being significantly less than previously estimated, management concluded a triggering event and potential impairment occurred and performed an impairment test of goodwill. Based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a $19 million goodwill impairment charge, equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the CSA reporting unit. Interest Expense and Interest Income Fiscal 2010 Interest expense of $252 million in fiscal 2010 decreased $8 million compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to lower interest rates. During March 2010 the Company retired debt of $500 million with interest of 7.375% due June 2011, which should positively impact net interest expense in fiscal 2011. Interest income decreased $14 million in fiscal 2010 from lower blended interest rates. Fiscal 2009 The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2009 of $75 million compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily a result of the issuance of debt for a combined $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008 to finance the acquisitions of Covansys Corporation and FCG. Interest expense for these notes and commercial paper was approximately $117 million for fiscal 2009, an increase from $47 million in fiscal 2008. Approximately $27 million of the remaining interest expense increase was due to the $1.5 billion draw down in the credit facility in October 2008 to repay commercial paper and increase the Companys liquidity position. The lower commercial paper outstanding and the maturity of the 3.5% $300 million senior notes in April 2008 resulted in lower interest expense which partially offset the increase. In addition, higher bor rowings in Europe to fund working capital requirements and additional capital leases in NPS contributed to the increase in interest expense. Interest income increased approximately $4 million as a result of an increase in cash balances from the drawdown of the credit facility as well as higher cash balances in India. Special Items No special items were recorded during fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Special items totaling $156 million were recorded during fiscal 2008 and consisted of: (1) a $134 million restructuring charge (see discussion below), and (2) a $22 million charge related to the retirement of the Companys chairman and chief executive officer recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2008. A restructuring plan was implemented during fiscal 2007 and 2008 and included objectives to 1) streamline CSCs worldwide operations and 2) leverage the increased use of lower cost global resources. Restructuring charges consisted predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations, including pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations, and paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions. Such liabilities are included in the consolidated pension liability account. Restructuring related pre tax cash payments for fiscal 2010 and 2009 were approximately $8 million and $68 million, respectively. As of April 2, 2010 and April 3, 2009, restructuring liability outstanding was $14 million and $20 million , respectively. Other (Income)/Expense For the years ended April 2, 2010, April 3, 2009 and March 28, 2008, the components of Other (income)/expense were as follows: 34 (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Foreign currency losses/(gains) $ 4 $ 25 $ (31 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (14 ) (15 ) (12 ) Other (gains)/losses (10 ) (2 ) (17 ) Total Other (income)/Expense $ (20 ) $ 8 $ (60 ) The Company reported other income of $20 million for fiscal 2010, compared with other expense of $8 million for fiscal 2009. Other (gains)/losses for fiscal 2010 primarily includes a gain of $6 million associated with a prior year business disposition, a gain of $6 million related to sale of the former corporate headquarters facility in El Segundo, California, and a $3 million loss related to a building for sale in Europe. The Company reported other expense of $8 million for fiscal 2009 compared with $60 million of other income in fiscal 2008. Other (income)/expense is comprised primarily of foreign currency gains and losses on intra company balances and gains and losses on sale of non operating assets, as well as costs associated with the Companys hedging program. Of the reported $25 million currency loss in fiscal 2009, $15 million was due to hedging costs. The remaining loss of $10 million is due to unhedged currency exposure. Foreign currency net gains for fiscal 2009 and 2008 were the result of the effect of currency rate movements, primarily between the currency pairs of U.S. dollar and the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Australian dollar, and Euro and the British Pound Sterling. Other (gains)/losses during fiscal 2008 included the sale of a building in Austin, TX, for a gain of approximately $11 million and the sale of available for sale securities for a gain of approximately $4 million. Taxes The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 was 19.7%, (17.3%), and 40.0%, respectively. As a global enterprise, our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions, and tax characteristics of our income. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. Our effective tax rate increased for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 primarily due to favorable settlements of open audit years that were recognized during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company reversed a valuation allowance of $53 million associated with branch net operating loss carryforwards and the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position of $18 million for foreign tax credits as a result of an audit settlement. In addition, the fiscal year 2009 and 2008 effective tax rates reflect the reclassification of prior year income from noncontrolling interests to a separate line following the adoption of a new accounting standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2010. Our effective tax rate decreased for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 primarily due to a $371 million reduction in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, due to audit settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Company also filed accounting method changes during the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 and had settlements with certain state and foreign jurisdictions for the fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The nature of the significant items subject to examination included depreciation and amortization, research credits, and international tax issues. 35 As of April 2, 2010, in accordance with ASC 740 10, the Companys liability for uncertain tax positions was $471 million, including interest of $85 million, penalties of $27 million, and net of tax attributes of $83 million. During the year ended April 2, 2010, the Company accrued an interest expense of $3 million ($3 million net of tax) and had a net release of penalties of $1 million, and as of April 2, 2010, has recognized a liability for interest of $85 million ($56 million net of tax) and penalties of $27 million. A more detailed analysis of differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Earnings Per Share and Share Base Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal 2010 decreased $2.03 to $5.28 from $7.31 in fiscal 2009. EPS was unfavorably impacted by lower net income and an increase in the average share base of 2.14 million shares from fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, income before taxes increased 8.5% or $81 million from fiscal 2009. Income tax expense increased $370 million in fiscal 2010 from the significant tax benefits that occurred in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 increased average share base was a result of increased number of exercised common stock equivalents from an appreciating stock price. EPS for fiscal 2009 increased $4.11 to $7.31 from $3.20 in fiscal 2008. EPS was favorably impacted by significantly higher net income and a decrease in the average share base of 17.6 million shares from fiscal 2008. The higher net income resulted from an increase in revenue of 1.5%, and a $166 million tax benefit in fiscal 2009 versus tax expense of $373 million in fiscal 2008. Other significant contributing elements were fiscal 2008s special items and the change in other expense/(income) from year over year. The average share base reduction was due to the full year effect of the share purchase program and a reduction in the dilutive effect of stock options partially offset by the exercise of 2.1 million employee stock options during the prior year. FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash Flows Dollars in millions Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Net cash from operations $ 1,643 $ 1,986 $ 1,343 Net cash used in investing (790 ) (1,038 ) (2,719 ) Net cash (used in)/from financing (487 ) 742 998 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 121 (92 ) 27 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 487 1,598 (351 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 2,297 699 1,050 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 2,784 $ 2,297 $ 699 The Company increased its net cash balance by $487 million during fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow decreased $343 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Cash used in investing activities decreased $248 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $487 million, a decrease of $1,229 million with several offsetting factors described below. 36 The Company significantly increased its net cash balance during fiscal 2009. Operating cash flow increased $643 million for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher net income and higher collections of accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in income tax liabilities. Cash used in investing activities decreased $1.7 billion primarily due to the fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Covansys Corporation and First Consulting Group which required a use of cash of $2 billion. Net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2009 was $742 million, a decrease of $256 million compared to fiscal 2008. Operating Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities for fiscal 2010 of $1,643 million represents a decrease of $343 million versus the prior year. Significant variances between the years in the factors that reconcile net income to net cash from operations are described below. Net income of $834 million was down $289 million, including the effect of the prior years significant tax settlements. The decrease in income taxes payable and income tax liabilities of $135 million for fiscal 2010 was $685 million less than the $820 million decrease for fiscal 2009. This was driven by a fiscal 2010 current income tax expense of $196 million versus a fiscal 2009 current income tax benefit of $413 million. The fiscal 2009 current income tax benefit was primarily the result of audit settlements with the IRS. Offsetting the lower increase in income taxes payable somewhat was a deferred income tax expense of $8 million for fiscal 2010 versus $247 million for fiscal 2009. Two significant non cash reconciliation items contributed to the lower net cash from operations metric. Unrealized foreign exchange gain/loss movements were $28 million of gains for fiscal 2010 compared to $98 million of losses for fiscal 2009. This result was driven by trends in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily movement in the British pound. Also, depreciation and amortization amounts for fiscal 2010 were $114 million less than 2009. The decreases occurred primarily in the first half of the year, driven by lower levels of operations and efforts by the company to limit capital spending. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $86 million more than prior year. The decrease was driven by higher pension contributions of $124 million as well as lower additions to pension liabilities for the recognition of pension expense, offset by increases in other current liabilities. Net cash from operating activities for fiscal 2009 of $1,986 million represents an increase of $643 million versus the prior year. Significant factors in these results are described below. A $564 million increase in net income. A reduction in receivables provided cash of $224 million in 2009. The reduction is primarily attributable to the Companys NPS and MSS operations resulting from a fiscal 2009 initiative to reduce DSO, as well as resolution of certain contract disputes and several contract completions. Increases in prepaid expenses and other assets required a use of cash of $164 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to work in progress on the Companys significant contract with the UK National Health Service (NHS). Decreases in accounts payable and accruals required use of cash in fiscal 2009 of $323 million. The decrease primarily resulted from timing of BSS consulting subcontractor payments, and vendor payments in BSS. 37 Income taxes payable and income tax liabilities decreased by $820 million during fiscal 2009. The decrease was driven by the Companys current income tax benefit for the year, including approximately $370 million of benefits associated with settlements with the IRS, and income tax payments of $323 million. Also impacting the fiscal 2009 comparison of operating cash flows to the prior year was $98 million of unrealized foreign currency losses compared to $27 million of gains for fiscal 2008. Investing Cash Flow The Companys capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software, and deferred outsourcing contract costs within the Companys MSS segment. Investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades, expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets. For cash flow presentation purposes, the Outsourcing Contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet. Outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contracts acquisition or start up, including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair mark et value of acquired assets. Investing cash outflows of $790 million decreased approximately $248 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was driven by reduced purchases of computer equipment, lower acquisition activity, and higher other investing inflows of $121 million, $95 million, and $39 million, respectively. The higher inflow from other investing activities was driven by $43 million from the liquidation of an equity investment and $25 million from the sale of the companys former headquarters facility in El Segundo, California. Future capital investments will depend on levels of new business and the mix of that business. Contracts in the NPS and BSS segments typically require lower levels of investment compared to contracts in the MSS segment. Investing cash outflows decreased to $1,038 million during fiscal 2009 compared to $2,719 million for fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the fiscal 2008 acquisitions of Covansys and FCG, which required a use of cash of $1,591 million, as well as a $178 million reduction in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Financing Cash Flow Cash used in financing activities was $487 million for fiscal 2010, a decrease of $1,229 million from fiscal 2009. The outflow change was primarily due to fiscal 2009s draw down on a $1.5 billion credit facility, offset by the repayment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of $500 million of long term debt scheduled to mature in June 2011. Fiscal 2009 results include a repayment of $263 million of commercial paper and $320 million of additional payments for lines of credit. Cash provided by financing activities was $742 million for fiscal 2009, a decrease of $256 million from fiscal 2008. The inflow was primarily due to a draw down on a $1.5 billion credit facility. CSC took this action to eliminate its reliance on the commercial paper market. Partially offsetting the financing cash inflows were repayments of $532 million of maturing long term debt, and repayment of commercial paper. Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $2,784 million at April 2, 2010, and $2,297 million at April 3, 2009, and shareholders equity increased $890 million to $6,508 million during fiscal 2010. At the end of fiscal 2010, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 36.5%, reduced from 43.0% at the end of fiscal 2009, and from 38.2% at the end of fiscal 2008. The decrease in the debt ratio for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the $500 million debt payment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. 38 The increase in the debt ratio in fiscals 2009 and 2008 was the result of (1) the issuance of $1.7 billion of commercial paper which was converted into long term notes during fiscal 2008 to fund the acquisitions of Covansys and FCG, (2) the issuance of approximately $263 million of commercial paper during the fourth quarter to fund the completion of the 10b5 1 share repurchase plan, and (3) the decrease in shareholders equity resulting from the 10b5 1 share repurchase. The following table summarizes the Companys debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year ends 2010 and 2009. Dollars in millions April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 Debt $ 3,744 $ 4,235 Equity 6,508 5,618 Total capitalization $ 10,252 $ 9,853 Debt to total capitalization 36.5 % 43.0 % At April 2, 2010, the Company had $21 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $54 million of current maturities and $3,669 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 2, 2010. At April 3, 2009, the Company had $32 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $30 million of current maturities and $4,173 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 3, 2009. On July 12, 2007, the Company entered into a new committed line of credit providing $1.5 billion of long term commercial paper backup. The line of credit expires on July 12, 2012. On October 22, 2008, the Company borrowed $1.5 billion under the line of credit. The proceeds from the drawdown of the line of credit were used primarily to repay maturing commercial paper and repay $200 million of maturing debt. The Company discontinued its issuance of commercial paper after October 22, 2008, and as of April 3, 2009 and April 2, 2010, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. This line requires the Company to (1) limit liens placed on our assets to $100 million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business; (2) maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated Earnings Be fore Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (3) not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The Company is in full compliance with these requirements. The Companys total liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents plus any borrowing availability under its credit facility. As of April 2, 2010, the Companys total liquidity was approximately $2.8 billion which equaled its cash and cash equivalents. As of April 2, 2010, the Company had $1.5 billion borrowed under the 2012 credit facility as noted previously. Continued uncertainty in the global economic conditions and the liquidity crisis may affect the Companys business as customers and suppliers may be unable to obtain financing to meet payment or delivery obligations to the Company. In addition, customers may decide to downsize, defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect revenue. 39 During this current global economic downturn, the Company continues to actively monitor the financial markets. Although the condition of the capital markets continues to be volatile, the Company believes it will continue to have access to the capital markets if the need arises. However, the volatility in the financial markets could directly affect the cost and terms of any future bank financing. Liquidity Risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk from operations and from the Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets. The Companys exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the Companys performance as well as customer acceptance. An example is the Companys complex contract with the United Kingdoms National Health Service (NHS) to deliver an integrated electronic patient records system with an announced value of approximately $5.4 billion which is included in the BSS segment. As of April 2, 2010, the Company had a net investment in the contract of approximately $600 million, or 400 million pounds sterling. Contract assets consist principally of contract work in progress and unbilled receivables but also equipment, software and other assets. The Company has held discussions with the customer on the NHS contract regarding potential modifications that may affect the scope of the work and total contract value. The contract is currently profitable and the Company expects to recover its investment, including the effect of the potential modifications; however, unforeseen future events to the extent they add costs beyond those included in the Companys current estimated costs to complete could potentially adversely impact such recovery and the Companys liquidity. The Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the Companys financial position. The Company was successful in issuing $1.7 billion of long term debt as a private placement under rule 144A during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This debt was then converted to publicly traded debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities and cash balances. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company was able to access the debt capital markets utilizing a Rule 144A offering, as noted above, which was then converted to publicly traded debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. However, there can be no assurances the Company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future. 40 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of April 2, 2010: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2013 & thereafter Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 28 $ 28 Letters of credit 674 $ 3 $ 1 678 Standby letters of credit 48 10 1 59 Foreign subsidiary debt guarantees 607 90 697 Total $ 1,357 $ 103 $ 2 $ 1,462 See Note 15 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. The following table summarizes the Companys payments on contractual obligations by period as of April 2, 2010: (Amounts in millions) 1 year or less 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Total Long term debt $ 2,497 $ 997 $ 3,494 Interest on fixed rate debt $ 119 236 $ 130 195 680 Capital lease obligations 39 65 30 80 214 Bank debt 21 21 Operating leases 291 398 200 94 983 Minimum purchase obligations 252 136 388 Other long term liabilities 15 15 Total $ 737 $ 3,332 $ 360 $ 1,366 $ 5,795 The Company adopted ASC 740 Income Taxes (FIN 48) on March 31, 2007. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash out flows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Regarding minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities. The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or the entire shortfall. 41 The above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Company has numerous plans, both inside and outside of the U.S., and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis. The minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors, and can be zero in some years. Funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including ERISA and Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) applied to U.S. government contracts. While there are certain minimum contribution requirements, CSC may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments, changes in workforce comp osition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts. During fiscal 2011, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $180 million to pension and $22 million to postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal 2011 because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations. During fiscal 2010, pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to $345 million, an increase of $124 million from $221 million in fiscal 2009. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 10 to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Dividends On May 19, 2010, CSCs Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per share, payable on July 15, 2010, to common stockholders of record on June 15, 2010. It is the expectation of the Board of Directors to pay a quarterly dividend going forward. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues. Changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract cou ld result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. We have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition, cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill; assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. 42 Revenue recognition The majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates. Revenue from our fixed unit price contracts, time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time. However, for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting, which is less than eight percent of the Companys revenues, the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation. Under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved. Costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved. The method requires estimates of revenues, costs and profits over the ent ire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. Modifications to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. We routinely negotiate such contract modifications. Many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers. The total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value. These relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value. Once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements, revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered. Estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception. Revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization If significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results. Capitalization of outsourcing contract costs Certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set up costs, and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets (premiums). Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. 43 Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion, to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include pro jected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues. Capitalization of software development costs We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For i nternal use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations. Estimates used to determine income tax expense We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We also must analyze income tax reserves, as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination. 44 Assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill We account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments in our determination of acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include target integration liabilities as well as litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining their fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations can be based on significant estimates provided by the Company, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual results versus estimates, could result in material impacts to earnings. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 (FAS No. 142) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and reductions in growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant im pact on the recoverability of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting units fair value to its carrying value. If a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment of goodwill may exist. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method. In applying the discounted cash flow method, the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a weighted average cost of capital. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, the Company applies discount rates based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit. The Companys cash flow projections also incorporate management&#8 217;s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The fair values of reporting units estimated under the income approach are assessed by comparing those values to fair value estimates derived using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting units operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. If the fair value of the reporting unit derived in the market approach is significantly different from the fair value estimated in the income approach, the Company reevaluates and, if necessary, adjusts the assumptions used in the income approach. 45 If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step of the impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. See discussion of fiscal 2009 goodwill im pairment charge in the Results of Operations section in this Managements Discussion and Analysis as well as Note 6 Goodwill to the consolidated financial statements. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company determined that a fresh start effort in determining the fair value of each reporting unit was not necessary due to the following: A full detail test was completed only three months prior at year end of fiscal 2009 (see below). The assets and liabilities that make up the reporting units had not changed significantly since the interim test. The detailed interim test indicated that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amount by a substantial margin. No events had occurred nor had circumstances changed that would materially change the assumptions or conclusions reached in the fiscal 2009 interim test. Consequently, in 2010, the Company carried forward its analysis from the prior fiscal 2009 test as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, the Companys stock price was subject to significant fluctuation, which the Company believes is due to the uncertainty related to the global economy and overall stock market volatility. As a result, the Companys market capitalization was frequently less than its net book value during the third and fourth quarters. At January 2, 2009, the Company evaluated all relevant factors and determined an interim impairment test was not necessary. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company undertook its fiscal 2010 budgeting process and at the end of the quarter, having substantially completed its budgeting process, det ermined that the expected cash flows for certain reporting units were significantly less than the estimated cash flows utilized in the fiscal 2009 annual impairment test. Management concluded these factors were a triggering event indicating potential impairment and performed an impairment test of goodwill as of April 3, 2009. Based on the results of the step one interim impairment test, there was an indication that an impairment may exist for one reporting unit (CSA) and the second step was performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment for CSA goodwill was determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill. Based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a $19 million goodwill impairment charge, equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the CSA reporting unit. There were no other significant intangible assets attributed to the CSA reporting unit nor were any other long lived assets attributable to that reporting unit determined to be impaired. 46 The reporting unit fair values determined in the step one income approach were used to derive an enterprise value of the Company. The Company performed a reconciliation of the enterprise value for the reporting units to the Companys market capitalization and concluded that the fair value results determined for the reporting units were reasonable. The estimated market capitalization considers recent trends in market capitalization and an expected control premium, based on comparable transactional history. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal growth rates, capital expenditures, as well as discount rates. Estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit. Although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain and can vary from a ctual results. In light of current economic conditions, additional impairments to one or more of our reporting units could occur in future periods. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the reporting units fair values would result in no additional reporting units failing step one. In the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company tested the recoverability of goodwill as part of its annual review with no indication of impairment. Utilizing the balances as of July 3, 2009, the excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the Companys reporting units ranged from 15% to 188%. A hypothetical ten percent decrease in the reporting units fair values would result in no additional reporting units failing step one. However, during its annual budgeting process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company noted that expected cash flows for two reporting units in the BSS segment were less than the expected cash flows utilized during its fiscal 2010 annual impairment assessment. The businesses had significant excesses of fair value over carrying value in the most recent annu al recoverability test. The Company believes that the decrease in cash flows is temporary and is not indicative of the long term economic prospects of the reporting units. As a result, management concluded no interim goodwill impairment test was needed as it was more likely that the fair value exceeded carrying value for the reporting units. Assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities We offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits (SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. We consider current market conditions such as changes in interest rates, in determining discount rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to cha nges in these and other assumptions. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the asset mix of the plan and other factors. Please see Note 10 for more details. The weighted average of the expected long term rate of return, for all plans, on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2010 and 2009 pension plan valuations was 7.8%. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the net periodic pension cost by approximately $16 million. 47 An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal 2010 net periodic pension cost was 7.4% compared to 6.2% used for fiscal 2009. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately $22 million, or increased it by approximately $24 million, respectively. Some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts. The accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year. Such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time. For CSC, market returns in fiscal 2010 caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. However, declining discount rates in fiscal 2010, which resulted in higher benefi t obligation growth, served to offset some of the positive impact of favorable asset returns in fiscal 2010. Pension assets as a percentage of projected benefit obligations increased during the fiscal year. Rising discount rates in fiscal 2009, which resulted in lower calculated benefit obligation growth, served to partially offset the impact of negative asset returns in fiscal 2009. At the end of fiscal 2010, a number of our pension plans had PBOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, due mostly to declining discount rates, and as a result, higher pension obligations were recognized in 2010 than in 2009. The effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal 2010 was to increase pension liability by $180 million, increase non current asset by $7 million, and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by $384 million ($264 million, net of taxes). At the end of fiscal 2009, a number of our pension plans had PBOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, due mostly to negative pension asset performance, higher pension obligations were recognized in 2009 than in 2008. The effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal 2009 was to increase pension liability by $627 million, decrease non current asset by $22 million, and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by $687 million ($446 million, net of taxes). Assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation We are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability in accordance with ASC 450 (SFAS No. 5) Accounting for Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results. 48 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. A hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the Companys future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt. Foreign Currency As a large global organization the Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenue is received, and any related short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. Thus, by generally matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company is able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. However, as the Company has increased its use of offshore support in recent years, it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations. The Company has policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. For accounting purposes, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and thus all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other (income)/expense. The Company also uses foreign currency put options to manage its exposure to the economic risk from movements in the Indian Rupee and the Danish Kroner. These financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year. They are used to offset existing foreign currency positions or as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes. During fiscal 2010, approximately 37% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. The Company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings. Given a hypothetical 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies, revenue would decrease by approximately 4% or $594 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 4% or $594 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencie s in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by approximately $52 million. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. At April 2, 2010, the Company had approximately $1,591 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $24 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 49
