Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and associated notes for the year ended April 1, 2011. The Company divested two businesses in fiscal 2011 and one in fiscal 2010. The result of operations for fiscal 2010 and 2009 have been recast from those presented in previously filed Forms 10 K to reflect the discontinued operations. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: Provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management; Enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes, providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed; and Provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. To achieve these objectives, the discussion is presented in the following sections: Overviewincludes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash, as well as a discussion of the economic and industry factors, key business drivers, key performance indicators, fiscal 2011 highlights, and fiscal 2012 commentary. Results of Operationsdiscusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal 2009 to 2011, describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and divestitures and currency impacts, and also describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories. Financial Conditiondiscusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the Companys liquidity and available capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimatesdiscusses the significant accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. OVERVIEW CSC provides information technology and business process outsourcing, consulting, systems integration and other information technology services to its customers. The Company targets the delivery of these services within three broad lines of business or sectors: North American Public Sector (NPS), Managed Services Sector (MSS), and Business Solutions and Services (BSS). The Companys reportable segments are as follows: The NPS segment operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations, Cost Accounting Standards and audits by various U.S. federal agencies. The MSS segment provides large scale and mid size outsourcing solutions and services to customers globally. The BSS segment provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services, business process outsourcing, and intellectual property based software solutions. For additional information regarding our business segments, see Note 15 Segment and Geographic Information within Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. 15 Economic and Industry Factors The Companys results of operations are impacted by economic conditions generally, including macroeconomic conditions. We are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us. A severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate. This may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations. Particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty, we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations. Our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve, as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance. Revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients. Our ability to add value to clients, and therefore generate revenues, depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. The BSS and MSS segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on information technology (IT) projects. CSC is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors, including service offerings and flexibility. Management monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. Outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships. Long term, complex outsourcing contracts, including their consulting components, require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work, in order to meet clients evolving business needs and our performance expectations. The NPS segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract is terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed. Shifting priorities of the U.S. government can also impact the future of projects. Management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts, legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations. Business Drivers Revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more. Factors affecting revenue include the Companys ability to successfully: bid on and win new contract awards, satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes, compete on services offered, delivery models offered, technical ability and innovation, quality, flexibility, global reach, experience, and results created, and identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues. Earnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and, in addition, the Companys ability to: control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension and general and administrative costs, anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses, accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals, develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore, and manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations. 16 Cash flows are affected by the above earnings factors and, in addition, by the following factors: timely management of receivables and payables, investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions, dispositions and large outsourcing contracts, and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments. Key Performance Indicators The Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue growth, margins, cash flow and return on investment. New contract winsIn addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, focusing on new contract wins provides management an assessment of the Companys ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or re competed contracts, as well as numerous external factors. CSC employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts. Revenue growthYear over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth. MarginsMargins reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations. Cash flowPrimary drivers of the Companys cash flow are earnings provided by the Companys operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings. Also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances. The Company also regularly reviews the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements of operating, investing and financing cash flows, as well as the non GAAP measure free cash flow. Return on investment (ROI)ROI is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization. A combination of strong margins (measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue) and investment base turnover (measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital) is required to generate sufficient returns on capital. Strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns. Fiscal 2011 Highlights Key operating results for fiscal 2011 include: Revenues increased $121 million or 0.8%, while increasing 0.9% on a constant currency basis.(1) Income from continuing operations before taxes of $968 million was down $54 million, or 5.3%. Operating income(2) decreased 12.8% to $1,217 million and operating income margins decreased to 7.6% from 8.8%.Net income of $759 million was down $75 million or 9.0%. Net income was comprised of income from continuing operations of $725 million and $34 million of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, as compared to $830 million and $4 million, respectively, in the prior year. Net income of $759 million was down $75 million or 9.0%. Net income was comprised of income from continuing operations of $725 million and $34 million of income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, as compared to $830 million and $4 million, respectively, in the prior year. Earnings per share (EPS) of $4.73 were down $0.55, or 10.4% on a diluted basis. EPS was comprised of $4.51 from continuing operations, and $0.22 from discontinued operations, as compared to $5.27 and $0.01, respectively, in the prior year. The Company announced contract awards of $14.0 billion including new MSS segment awards of $5.0 billion, NPS segment awards of $5.5 billion, and BSS segment awards of $3.5 billion. Total backlog(3) at the end of fiscal 2011 was $36.0 billion, a decrease of $6.3 billion as compared to the backlog at the end of fiscal 2010 of $42.3 billion. Of the total $36.0 billion backlog, $10 billion is expected to be realized as revenue in fiscal 2012. Of the total $36.0 billion backlog, $13.1 billion is not yet funded. Cash provided by operating activities was $1,564 million. Cash used in investing and financing activities was $892 million, and $1,676 million, respectively. Free cash flow(4) of $620 million in fiscal 2011 was 84% of net income attributable to CSC common shareholders and down from $811 million in fiscal 2010, driven primarily by lower operating cash flows and higher payments on capital leases and long term asset financings. 17 Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)(5) was 79 days at April 1, 2011, an improvement from 81 days at April 2, 2010. Debt to total capitalization ratio(6) was 25.4% at year end, a decrease of 11.1 percentage points from 36.5% at fiscal 2010 year end, reflecting the pay down on the Companys $1.5 billion corporate credit facility. Return on Investment (ROI)(7) was 8.4% for the year, down from 9.9% in fiscal 2010, a change driven by lower pre tax earnings and higher taxes. (1) Selected references are made on a "constant currency basis" so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency rates, thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period. Financial results on a "constant currency basis" are calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior periods currency conversion rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. (2) Operating income is a non GAAP measure used by management to assess performance at the segments and on a consolidated basis. The Companys definition of such measure may differ from that of other companies. We define operating income as revenue less costs of services, depreciation and amortization expense, and segment general and administrative (G&A) expense, excluding corporate G&A. Management compensates for the limitations of this non GAAP measure by also reviewing income before taxes, which includes costs excluded from the operating income definition such as corporate G&A, interest and other income. A reconciliation of consolidated operating income to income before taxes is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (In millions) April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 Operating income $ 1,217 $ 1,395 $ 1,361 Corporate G&A (138 ) (168 ) (179 ) Interest expense (168 ) (252 ) (260 ) Interest Income 37 27 40 Goodwill impairment (4 ) Other income (expense) 20 20 (8 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes $ 968 $ 1,022 $ 950 (3) For NPS, announced award values for competitive indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity (IDIQ) awards represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract. Announced values for non competitive IDIQ awards represent managements estimate at the award date. Business awards for MSS are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates, and include option years. BSS award values are based on firm commitments. Backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly long term contracts, based on customer commitments that the Company believes to be firm. Backlog value is based on contract commitments, managements judgment and assumptions about volume of services, availability of customer funding and other factors. Backlog estimates for government contracts include both the funded and unfunded portions and all of the option periods. Value of competitive IDIQ awards is included in computation of backlog only when a task order is awarded. Value of non competitive IDIQ awards included in computation of backlog represents managements estimate at the award date. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements. (4) The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure: Twelve Months Ended (Amounts in millions) April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 Free cash flow $ 620 $ 811 $ 1,021 Net cash used in investing activities 892 790 1,038 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (158 ) (5 ) (100 ) Business dispositions 119 14 Payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings 91 33 27 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,564 $ 1,643 $ 1,986 Net cash used in investing activities $ (892 ) $ (790 ) $ (1,038 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (1,676 ) $ (487 ) $ 742 Free cash flow is a non GAAP measure and the Companys definition of such measure may differ from that of other companies. We define free cash flow as equal to the sum of (1) operating cash flows, (2) investing cash flows, excluding business acquisitions, dispositions and purchase or sale of available for sale securities, and (3) payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings. CSCs free cash flow measure does not distinguish operating cash flows from investing cash flows as they are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating and investing cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is one of the factors CSC management uses in reviewing the overall performance of the business. Management compensates for the limitations of this non GAAP measure by also reviewing the GAAP measures of operating, investing and financing cash flows as well as debt levels measured by the debt to total capitalization ratio. (5) DSO as follows: DSO is calculated as total receivables at fiscal period end divided by revenue per day. Revenue per day equals total revenues divided by the number of days in the fiscal period. Total receivables include unbilled receivables but exclude tax receivables and long term receivables. 18 (6) Debt to total capitalization ratio is defined as total current and long term debt divided by total debt and equity, including noncontrolling interest. (7) ROI is calculated by multiplying profit margin by the investment base turnover. The profit margin used is a) the last four quarters adjusted net income available to CSC common shareholders (net income available to CSC common shareholders adjusted to exclude interest expense and special items, net of their corresponding tax effects), divided by b) the last four quarters revenues. The tax effect is calculated by multiplying CSCs last four quarters interest expense and special items by the corresponding effective tax rate. Investment base turnover equals the last four quarters revenues divided by average debt and equity during the last four quarters. It should be noted that the adjusted net income figure available to CSC common shareholders is not identical to net income available to CSC common shareholders as determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore reconciled to the GAAP measure in the table below. The Companys calculation of ROI may not be comparable with other companies measures using the same or similar terms. Management compensates for any limitations of this non GAAP measure by reviewing a number of metrics, including GAAP measures such as EPS, operating and investing cash flows, and the debt to total capitalization ratio. Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation Twelve Months Ended (Amounts in millions) April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010 Adjusted Net Income $ 866 $ 1,022 Less: Interest expense 168 252 Special items Tax effect of Interest Expense (42 ) (47 ) Net Income attributable to CSC common shareholders $ 740 $ 817 The Companys significant wins and scope extensions during fiscal 2011 included the following: NPS: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ($317 million) U.S. Army ($224 million) MSS: UBS ($580 million) Textron ($387 million) Selex Galileo ($200 million) BSS: Financial services industry clients ($1.5 billion) Technology and consumer industry clients ($772 million) Health service industry clients ($463 million) The Company has developed a broad, long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines. A significant amount of CSCs revenue is derived from long term contracts including information technology outsourcing, build and maintain engagements and U.S. federal government engagements. This provides the Company with a base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens. Cash and cash equivalents at April 1, 2011, was approximately $1.8 billion, down from $2.8 billion at April 2, 2010, a $947 million decrease. The decrease was a result of financing and investing cash outflows of $1.7 billion cash and $892 million, respectively, during fiscal 2011, offset by operating cash inflows of $1.6 billion. Net income drove the operating cash inflows, higher purchases of property and equipment and business acquisitions drove the investing cash outflows, and a repayment on the Companys credit facility drove the financing outflows. Cash and cash equivalents at April 2, 2010, was nearly $2.8 billion, up from $2.3 billion at April 3, 2009, a $487 million increase. The increase was a result of $1.6 billion cash proceeds from operating activities during fiscal 2010, offset by investing and financing cash outflows of $790 million and $487 million, respectively. Net income drove the operating cash inflows, and capital expenditures and an early debt retirement drove the investing and financing outflows. 19 Fiscal 2012 Commentary As the macroeconomic environment signals varying signs of recovery, CSC is well positioned to provide a broad portfolio of services to public and private sector clients. The recovery is expected to vary by geography and industry, and will provide different rates of growth for the Companys lines of business. CSC will also continue to focus on cost control and cash flow performance during the fiscal year. As a leading federal contractor, and one of the top IT service providers to the U.S. federal government, CSCs NPS segment is well positioned to benefit from government demand for IT services. The market trend in the public sector continues to be positive with increased budgets in place for government fiscal year 2011, and with exceptions, budgets are increased for the government fiscal year 2012 based upon President Obamas recent budget submission. However, the budget actually passed and the timeliness of its adoption will both influence the procurement environment for fiscal 2012. Defense, Intelligence, and Homeland Security budgets remain intact with continued opportunities for growth, consistent with the ongoing pace of military operational activity. Additionally, there are selective opportunities across the Civil sector as the administration continues to implement its agenda. CSC sees particular growth opportunities in the areas of data center consolidation and cloud, identity management, health IT and cybersecurity. However, the Company expects that the procurement environment will continue to become increasingly complex, driven by new requirements for transparency, insourcing, and new guidelines on organizational conflicts of interest. Contract protests continue to delay many key government procurements. While the ultimate distribution of U.S. federal funds and project assignments can vary, the Company expects broad IT and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the U.S. federal government. The Company expects the global commercial market to continue to recover during fiscal year 2012. MSS bookings for fiscal year 2011 were $5.0 billion (compared to 2010 of $8.7 billion). This provides a base of significant outsourcing contracts, which the Company expects will continue to provide a stable revenue stream during fiscal 2012 in this segment. However, growth from the MSS revenue stream is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and the resulting pressure on prices, the maturation of the legacy outsourcing business, as well as volatility in demand for short term projects and other contract conclusions. Overall, the Company is seeing improvements in the opportunity pipeline in the commercial sectors providing an encouraging sign that clients are returning to transformational agendas. BSS is expected to grow faster than MSS in fiscal 2012; however, both MSS and BSS will focus on higher growth market segments including applications, cloud computing, cybersecurity, healthcare IT, financial services, and other industry specific solutions bringing advanced solutions to market and by expanding the Companys utilization in low cost delivery centers. Currency exchange movements will also influence results and the Company is unable to predict future currency exchange rates. In addition to anticipated revenue growth, management intends to continue its focus on operating income margin in fiscal 2012. Management of SG&A and other overhead costs, as well as continuing utilization of offshore and near shore low cost centers, is expected to provide margin growth in combination with margin improvement from increased revenue. CSC will also continue its focus on cash management. In addition to operational issues and the effectiveness of working capital management, the Companys free cash flow can be impacted by realized gains or losses on foreign currency hedging programs. Such gains or losses are dependent on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates which the Company is unable to predict. 20 Results of Operations Revenues Revenues for the NPS, MSS, and BSS segments for fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009 were as follows: Twelve Months Ended April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010 April 3, 2009 Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount NPS $ 6,002 (1.5% ) $ 6,095 4.1 % $ 5,857 MSS 6,583 2.0 6,451 (6.8 ) 6,922 BSS 3,570 2.5 3,483 (7.3 ) 3,759 Corporate 14 17 17 Subtotal 16,169 0.8 16,046 (3.1 ) 16,555 Eliminations (127 ) (125 ) (123 ) Total Revenue 16,042 0.8 $ 15,921 (3.1 ) $ 16,432 See Note 15 Segment and Geographic Information within Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. The major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows: Twelve Months Ended April 1, 2011 vs. April 2, 2010 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total NPS 0.2 % (1.7 )% (1.5 )% MSS (0.1 )% 2.1 2.0 BSS 0.9 (0.2 ) 1.8 2.5 Cumulative Net Percentage 0.3 % (0.1 )% 0.6 % 0.8 % Twelve Months Ended April 2, 2010 vs. April 3, 2009 Acquisitions Approximate Impact of Currency Fluctuations Net Internal Growth Total NPS 0.3 % 3.8 % 4.1 % MSS (1.1 )% (5.7 ) (6.8 )% BSS 0.9 0.6 (8.8 ) (7.3 )% Cumulative Net Percentage 0.3 % (0.2 )% (3.2 )% (3.1 )% 21 North American Public Sector The Companys North American Public Sector segment revenues were derived from the following sources: Twelve Months Ended April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010(2) April 3, 2009(2) Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount Percent Change Amount Department of Defense $ 4,498 (0.1 )% $ 4,502 9.4 % $ 4,116 Civil agencies 1,300 (6.1 ) 1,385 (12.5 ) 1,582 Other (1) 204 (1.9 ) 208 30.8 159 Total $ 6,002 (1.5 )% $ 6,095 4.1 % $ 5,857 (1) Other revenues of foreign, state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the NPS segment. (2) Prior year amounts have been adjusted to exclude discontinued operations revenues from two entities sold in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 NPS segment revenue decreased 1.5%, or $93 million, for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Excluding two small acquisitions made at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011, revenue decreased 1.7%. DOD revenue declined slightly despite higher revenues on several programs. The increases were offset by contract completions, the adverse effects from reduced tasking on two U.S. Army contracts, as well as from the impact of a one time, $65 million revenue benefit in fiscal 2010 from a claim settlement that did not repeat in fiscal 2011. Civil declines came primarily from contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation and the EPA that either ended or experienced reductions in customer spending. One factor affecting the overall year over year revenue decline was an ongoing uncertainty among many government customers about their fiscal budgets and potential budget cuts due to ongoing Congressional debates and temporary continuing resolutions on the current budget. This uncertainty resulted in delayed decisions on a significant number of new business awards during fiscal 2011. As the uncertainty lifts, we expect many long delayed award decisions to finally occur. Also impacting the year over year change is the increasing trend in contested awards, thereby slowing the ultimate start date of many contracts. For example, CSC won a significant award with the Transportation Security Administration in fiscal 2010 but protests resulted in numerous delays of up to 10 months. Another factor affecting many government contractors is the recent renewed government initiative to insource personnel rather than use external providers. The impact was not significant on CSCs results given the nature of the types of services we provide, and we expect a diminished impact in the future as government agencies revisit the costs and benefits of such an initiative. During fiscal 2011, the Company announced federal contract awards with a total value of $5.5 billion compared to $7.1 billion during fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 NPS segment revenue increased 4.1%, or $238 million, for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. Revenues from major new contracts contributed 4.6% or $269 million, including a field operations contract that commenced in the first quarter and contributed 3.0%, or $177 million. Revenue also increased 1.1% from a claim settlement of $65 million, and 0.3%, or $19 million from acquisitions. Revenue was offset 1.1% or $67 million from one extra week that was included in fiscal 2009. Revenue from civil agencies declined $197 million, primarily the result of contract conclusions and reduced funding on certain contracts with various civil agencies. Delays in funding and contract completions on various EPA contracts accounted for $65 million. An IRS contract reduction contributed $50 million. The additional week included in fiscal 2009 contributed $30 million of the civil agencies year over year decline. Revenue decline was only partially offset by new business revenue on other civil agency contracts in fiscal 2010. Revenue from other sources increased $49 million primarily from a state contract that commenced late in fiscal 2009 and contributed $38 million in fiscal 2010. 22 Managed Services Sector Fiscal 2011 MSS segment revenue grew $132 million, or 2.0% in fiscal 2011, and increased 2.1% excluding foreign currency effects. The overall MSS growth was primarily from a combination of new client engagements won in fiscal 2010 and 2011, which generated approximately $521 million revenue in fiscal 2011, as well as growth on existing accounts which contributed $297 million in year over year growth. Partly offsetting the increases were contract conclusions and terminations of $272 million plus volume and scope reductions on existing accounts totaling $384 million. During fiscal 2011, the Company announced contract awards with a total value of $5.0 billion compared to $8.7 billion during fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 MSS segment revenue declined $471 million, or 6.8% in fiscal 2010, and declined 5.7% excluding foreign currency effects of $74 million. Revenue decreased 5.1%, or $352 million, primarily from a lower level of projects in excess of contract baseline volumes, mainly in the Americas, as well as reduced scope and volume at some key clients. Other declines were generally related to conclusions of smaller contracts totaling 3.9%, or $268 million. Revenue declines were partially offset by new account growth, mainly in the Americas, of 3.2%, or $223 million. During fiscal 2010, the Company announced contract awards with a total value of $8.7 billion compared to $5.1 billion during fiscal 2009. Business Solutions & Services Fiscal 2011 BSS segment revenue increased $87 million, or 2.5% in fiscal 2011, and increased 2.7% excluding foreign currency effects. Acquisitions accounted for approximately $29 million or 0.9% of the year over year increase. The remaining growth resulted primarily from increases in the BSS consulting business in financial services, which grew $58 million year over year, and from other consulting operations which were up $30 million, excluding acquisitions. Additional growth came from an Asian hardware resale business and an Australian IT staffing operation which contributed $23 million. Offsetting the increases was a revenue decline on the U.K.s National Health Service (NHS) contract by $46 million due to delays in milestone deliverables. The financial services group benefited from increased business process outsourcing services as well as from higher software and project related services. Other than healthcare related operations, other consulting operations grew $60 million and were up by double digit rates in select regions, including Europes western region, Brazil and Australia, and were also up slightly in the U.S., while down in other regions across Europe. Healthcare related consulting operations were down $30 million, however, primarily due to the conclusion of a major contract with a large insurance company and continued uncertainty in the U.S. marketplace regarding healthcare reform. During fiscal 2011, BSS had contract awards of $3.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 BSS segment revenue declined $276 million, or 7.3% in fiscal 2010, and declined 7.9% excluding foreign currency effects as compared to fiscal 2009. Partially offsetting internal declines was a $28 million increase from the acquisition of a foreign consulting business in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The decreased revenues, excluding the currency effect and acquisition, included declines of $84 million in healthcare related consulting operations, $27 million in financial services, and approximately $123 million in other consulting operations. The declines were attributable to slowed demand in the healthcare market partly resulting from ongoing uncertainty about healthcare reform, project reductions especially in the financial services market and overall macroeconomic pressures that resulted in reduced customer spending on IT projects and services. Approximately $59 million of the decline was attributable to an extra week in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2010. Milestone delays on the U.K.s NHS contract also contributed $49 million of year over year declines, and another $46 million was from reductions in an Asian hardware resale business and an Australian IT staffing operation. 23 Costs and Expenses The Companys costs and expenses were as follows: Twelve Months Ended Percentage of Revenue Dollars in millions 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization) $ 12,925 $ 12,618 $ 13,000 80.6 % 79.2 % 79.1 % Selling, general and administrative 965 981 1,071 6.0 6.2 6.5 Depreciation and amortization 1,073 1,095 1,179 6.7 6.9 7.2 Goodwill impairment 4 Interest expense, net 131 225 220 0.8 1.4 1.3 Other (income) expense (20 ) (20 ) 8 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Total $ 15,074 $ 14,899 $ 15,482 94.0 % 93.6 % 94.1 % Fiscal 2011 Historically, the Company has substantially matched revenues and costs in the same currency. However, the Company is increasing its use of offshore support and therefore is increasingly exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2011 was 94.0%, up from 93.6% in fiscal 2010. Costs of services (COS) rose 1.4% points as a result of adverse adjustments in MSS and BSS including out of period adjustments primarily in MSS as further discussed below. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense ratio and depreciation and amortization (D&A) ratio both improved 0.2% points as a result of ongoing cost and capital expenditure reduction initiatives. Other income of $20 million was primarily due to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains. Fiscal 2010 Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2010 improved to 93.6% from 94.1% in fiscal 2009. COS ratio was relatively flat in fiscal 2010 as the Company aligned these expenses with revenue declines. SG&A expense ratio decreased 0.3%, which was a result of reduced headcount, lower bid and proposal costs, and cost reduction initiatives. D&A ratio improved 0.3% from reduced capital spending and intangible asset amortization. Other income of $20 million was primarily due to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and a gain from the sale of the Companys former headquarters, partially offset by foreign currency losses. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 amounts have been adjusted from those reported in the prior year Form 10 K to reflect the discontinued operations presentation of the results of two NPS divestitures in fiscal 2011 and one BSS divestiture in fiscal 2010. Out of Period Adjustments During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded various pre tax adjustments reducing income from continuing operations before taxes by $51 million ($34 million, net of taxes), that should have been recorded in prior fiscal years, primarily fiscal 2010. As discussed in Note 2 Out of Period Adjustments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, these recorded adjustments comprised $91 million of charges reducing income from continuing operations before taxes originating out of the Companys MSS operations in the Nordic region, and $40 million of adjustments increasing income from continuing operations before taxes, principally out of other MSS businesses with $36 of the $40 million within MSS. These adjustments reduced MSS operating income (a non GAAP measure) by $53 million as discussed in Note 15, Segment and Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also recorded out of period income tax benefits in fiscal 2011 of $17 million, consisting of $12 million of income tax benefits related to the net pre tax out of period adjustments and $5 million of unrelated income tax benefit adjustments. The net impact of the out of period adjustments was immaterial to the consolidated results, financial position and cash flows for each fiscal year affected by the adjustments. 24 The following schedules show the effect on selected line items in the fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 Consolidated Statements of Income under the rollover method. Twelve Months Ended April 1, 2011 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) As Reported Adjustments Increase/(Decrease) Amount Adjusted for Removal of Errors Revenue $ 16,042 $ 35 $ 16,077 Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization) 12,925 (19 ) 12,906 Selling, general and administrative 965 1 966 Depreciation and amortization 1,073 3 1,076 Interest expense 168 (1 ) 167 Other (income) expense (20 ) (20 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes 968 51 1,019 Taxes on income 243 17 260 Income from continuing operations 725 34 759 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 34 34 Net income attributable to CSC common shareholders 740 34 774 EPS Diluted Continuing operations $ 4.51 $ 0.22 $ 4.73 Discontinued operations 0.22 0.22 Total 4.73 0.22 4.95 Twelve Months Ended April 2, 2010 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) As Reported Adjustments Increase/(Decrease) Amount Adjusted for Removal of Errors Revenue $ 15,921 $ (19 ) $ 15,902 Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization) 12,618 33 12,651 Selling, general and administrative 981 (2 ) 979 Depreciation and amortization 1,095 (2 ) 1,093 Interest expense 252 252 Other (income) expense (20 ) (20 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes 1,022 (48 ) 974 Taxes on income 192 (18 ) 174 Income from continuing operations 830 (30 ) 800 Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 4 4 Net income attributable to CSC common shareholders 817 (30 ) 787 EPS Diluted Continuing operations $ 5.27 $ (0.20 ) $ 5.07 Discontinued operations 0.01 0.01 Total 5.28 (0.20 ) 5.08 Costs of Services Fiscal 2011 Costs of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2011 increased to 80.6% from 79.2% for fiscal 2010, primarily driven by adverse changes in MSS EMEA and Americas operations as well as from a significant adjustment on the U.K.s National Health Service (NHS) contract within the BSS segment. As discussed above, out of period adjustments recorded in MSS increased fiscal 2011 COS by $19 million and understated the reported fiscal 2010 COS by $33 million. Additionally in the Nordics region, operational issues including excess staffing capacity, performance issues and lower revenue also increased the COS ratio in fiscal 2011. The MSS fiscal 2011 COS ratio was further adversely impacted by higher start up and transition expenses on several contracts and a strengthening rupee during fiscal 2011 which increased costs on U.S. dollar denominated contracts. BSS COS ratio increased from a $57 million increase in costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result of a change in estimated profitability on the NHS contract. The change in estimated profitability was based on expected contract modifications which are also expected to reduce total committed contract value of the program by $1,100 million to $1,300 million. Nonetheless, the contract remains profitable. Cost control measures taken in fiscal 2010 and continuing into fiscal 2011 partially offset the MSS and BSS issues noted above. BSS measures included salary and headcount reductions, facilities reductions in space and cost, as well as reduction in discretionary spending including travel costs. MSS cost control measures included a workforce realignment comprising reductions and shifting to low cost regions as well as ongoing focus on containing discretionary spending and adjustments to incentive compensation. 25 Improved profitability on a large fixed price NPS contract accounted for under percentage of completion, as well as positive adjustments to estimated profitability on that contract during the year, resulted in an improvement to the NPS COS ratio. The overall COS ratio for the Company was further positively impacted by a slight change in mix of the three segments, as NPS COS ratios are generally higher than those in MSS and BSS, and NPS revenue as a percentage of total CSC revenue declined slightly from fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 Costs of services as a percentage of revenue was relatively flat at 79.2% for fiscal 2010 and 79.1% for fiscal 2009, primarily driven by matching revenue declines with cost reduction measures. BSS Americas region, which experienced increased COS ratios in the healthcare services and global consulting, offset improvements in NPS and MSS ratios, as NPS and MSS had larger percentages of revenue of the consolidated Company than fiscal 2009. The NPS segment ratio for fiscal 2010 improved from changes in estimated profitability on two contracts netting to $35 million, and curtailment of certain pension benefits of $7 million. In the MSS segment, improvements in CSC India were driven by cost reductions, efficiencies, and by the weakening rupee during fiscal 2010, which reduced costs on US dollar denominated contracts. Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal 2011 Selling, general and administrative expense improved 0.2% to 6% as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This improvement was driven by reductions in Corporate G&A costs through lower legal and professional fees, and incentive compensation while the business segments maintained consistent ratios with fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2010 Selling, general and administrative expense improved 0.3% to 6.2% as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The NPS ratio increased 0.1 percentage point from additional legal fees and acquisition costs. Ongoing MSS and BSS cost reduction actions were the primary driver of the improved SG&A as a percentage of revenue, including decreases in headcount, salaries, benefits, and legal fees, as well as movement of certain administrative functions to lower cost geographies. Improvements were primarily in the European region and across the financial services operations of the BSS segment. Offsetting these improvements were increases in the SG&A ratio in other segment regions as revenue decreased faster than cost reductions. Depreciation and Amortization Fiscal 2011 Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.2 percentage points to 6.7% of revenue in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Lower D&A expense in both the MSS & BSS segments were the contributors to this performance reflecting the reducing levels of capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 and 2009 in line with the Companys ongoing program. Fiscal 2010 Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.3 percentage points to 6.9% of revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The D&A ratio improved slightly in NPS, which had a lower than average ratio of 1.8% in fiscal 2010 and 2009, and which had a larger proportionate share of revenues year over year from 36% up to 38%. The NPS and MSS improvements resulted from reductions in capital expenditures, and reduced amortization of transition costs and customer intangibles. The ratio improvement was offset by slightly higher ratios in BSS as revenue decreased faster than expenses. Goodwill Impairment Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in our second fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, "Intangibles Goodwill and Other." Each of the fiscal 2011 and 2010 tests resulted in no indication of impairment of goodwill. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, due to factors such as stock price fluctuation, uncertainty in the global economy, and the expected cash flows for certain reporting units being significantly less than previously estimated, management concluded a triggering event and potential impairment had occurred. Based on the results of the interim impairment test conducted at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company recorded a $19 million goodwill impairment charge, equal to the carrying amount of the goodwill attributable to the Computer Systems Advisors (CSA) reporting unit. Of the $19 million charge, $15 million was allocated to fiscal 2009 discontinued operations. 26 Income from Discontinued Operations Fiscal 2011 During fiscal 2011, CSC completed the divestiture of two businesses within its NPS segment whose ultimate customer is the U.S. federal government, for consideration of $121 million. Both of the divestitures were driven by Organizational Conflicts of Interest concerns. The discontinued operations provided the Company income from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $34 million, which was comprised of income from discontinued operations of $6 million and a gain on disposition of $28 million. Fiscal 2010 During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, CSC sold an immaterial business within its BSS segment for consideration of $34 million. The Company realized income from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $4 million, which comprised of income from discontinued operations of $10 million and loss on disposition of $6 million (see Note 3 of consolidated financial statements). Interest Expense and Interest Income Fiscal 2011 Interest expense of $168 million in fiscal 2011 decreased $84 million compared to fiscal 2010. The lower interest expense is a result of lower debt levels during fiscal 2011 primarily due to the repayment of the 7.375% $500 million term note in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and repayment of the $1.5 billion credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The decrease in interest expense due to repayment of the term notes and credit facility was slightly offset by higher interest on increased capital lease activity and interest on borrowings for assets acquired under long term financing primarily in the MSS segment. Interest income increased $10 million to $37 million in fiscal 2011 due to the combination of increase in interest rates and in foreign cash balances, primarily in India, Australia and Asia. Fiscal 2010 Interest expense of $252 million in fiscal 2010 decreased $8 million compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was due to lower interest rates. During March 2010 the Company retired debt of $500 million with interest of 7.375% due June 2011, which as noted above contributed to lower fiscal 2011 interest expense. Interest income decreased $13 million in fiscal 2010 from lower blended interest rates. Other (Income) Expense The components of Other (income) expense, for the years ended April 1, 2011, April 2, 2010, and April 3, 2009, are: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Foreign currency (gains) losses $ (2 ) $ 4 $ 25 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (11 ) (14 ) (15 ) Other gains (7 ) (10 ) (2 ) Total $ (20 ) $ (20 ) $ 8 There was no change in total other (income) expense from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010; however, there was a slightly different mix. Foreign currency net gains of $2 million were the result of the effect of currency rate movement primarily between the U.S. dollar and Indian rupee, which favorably impacted the Companys hedging program. Reduction of equity earnings reflects the disposal of a minority equity shareholding during the year, while the other gains reflect a $3 million gain from the disposal of the minority equity investment, and a gain of $4 million from other minority investments. The Company reported other income of $20 million for fiscal 2010 compared with $8 million of other expense in fiscal 2009. Other (gains) losses for fiscal 2010 primarily includes a gain of $6 million related to sale of the former corporate headquarters facility in El Segundo, California, a gain of $6 million from a positive workers compensation claim experience on a business divested in fiscal 2005, and a $3 million loss related to a building for sale in Europe. Of the reported $25 million currency loss in fiscal 2009, $15 million was due to hedging costs. The remaining loss of $10 million is due to unhedged currency exposure. Foreign currency net gains for fiscal 2010 were the result of the effect of currency rate movements, primarily between the currency pairs of U.S. dollar and the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Australian dollar, and Euro and the British Pound Sterling. 27 Taxes The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was 25.1%, 18.8%, and (18.2)%, respectively. As a global enterprise, our tax rates are affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions, tax planning, and tax characteristics of our income. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate increased for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to change in mix of income between foreign and U.S. operations and an increase in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2011. The increases to the effective tax rate were partially offset by income tax benefits related to research and development credits ("R&D") that were primarily composed of new credits related to the passage of tax legislation, and tentative agreements related to the current IRS exam cycle which reduced the effective tax rate by 7.2%. In addition, the Company generated greater U.S. foreign tax credits in the current fiscal year than in the prior fiscal year which reduced the effective tax rate by 2.9%. Our effective tax rate increased for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to favorable settlements of open audit years that were recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2009. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, the Company reversed a valuation allowance associated with branch net operating loss carryforwards and remeasured an uncertain tax position for foreign tax credits as a result of an audit settlement, which reduced the effective tax rate by 5.2% and 1.8%, respectively. As of April 1, 2011, in accordance with ASC 740 10, the Companys liability for uncertain tax positions was $477 million, including interest of $88 million, penalties of $29 million, and net of tax attributes of $66 million. During the year ended April 1, 2011, the Company accrued interest expense of $3 million ($2 million net of tax) and accrued penalties of $2 million, and as of April 1, 2011, has recognized a liability for interest of $88 million ($58 million net of tax) and penalties of $29 million. Effective during the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company elected to change the tax status of one of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company is currently evaluating the potential tax benefit of this election, which could range as high as $120 million. A more detailed analysis of differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Earnings Per Share and Share Base Earnings per share on a diluted bases decreased $0.55 to $4.73 in fiscal 2011. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net income attributable to CSC common shareholders of 9.4% for fiscal 2011. Net income attributable to CSC common shareholders decreased $77 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, due to a combination of lower pre tax earnings and higher taxes in fiscal 2011. The decrease in EPS was also due to an increase in the weighted average common shares and common stock equivalents during the fiscal year due to the year over year appreciation in the Companys stock price. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for fiscal 2010 decreased $2.03 to $5.28 from $7.31 in fiscal 2009. EPS was unfavorably impacted by lower net income and an increase in the average share base of 2.14 million shares from fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, income before taxes increased 7.6% or $72 million from fiscal 2009. Income tax expense increased $365 million in fiscal 2010 from the significant tax benefits that occurred in fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 increased average share base was a result of increased number of exercised common stock equivalents from an appreciating stock price. 28 Financial Condition Cash Flows Amounts in millions Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Net cash from operations $ 1,564 $ 1,643 $ 1,986 Net cash used in investing (892 ) (790 ) (1,038 ) Net cash (used in) from financing (1,676 ) (487 ) 742 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 57 121 (92 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (947 ) 487 1,598 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 2,784 2,297 699 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 1,837 $ 2,784 $ 2,297 The Companys cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $947 million during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. While net cash from operations in fiscal 2011 approximated fiscal 2010, there was a greater use of cash for both investing and financing activities. Cash used in investing activities increased $102 million compared to fiscal 2010 and reflects higher net acquisition costs and equipment purchases. Cash used in financing activities increased $1.2 billion primarily due to the repayment of the $1.5 billion credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Operating Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities for fiscal 2011 of $1,564 million decreased $79 million as compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to reduced cash flows from advance contract payments of approximately $370 million, mainly from the U.K. National Health Services (NHS) contract, offset by higher collections from customers of approximately $100 million, reduced interest and tax payments of $97 million and $126 million, respectively. The reduced NHS advance contract payments are a result of delays in achieving certain milestones for Lorenzo Regional Care, as well as ongoing contract modification negotiations. The higher collections and reduced vendor payments are due to timing. The reduction in cash taxes paid is primarily due to additional pension contribution made in March 2010, which resulted in the Company generating a significant overpayment on its fiscal 2010 tax return which reduced cash tax payments during fiscal 2011. Additionally, the Company made a cash payment to settle a tax audit with the German tax authorities during fiscal 2010, which did not recur in fiscal 2011. Net cash from operating activities for fiscal 2010 of $1,643 million represents a decrease of $343 million versus the prior year. Significant variances between the years in the factors that reconcile net income to net cash from operations are described below. Net income of $834 million in fiscal 2010 was down $289 million, including the effect of the prior years significant tax settlements. The decrease in income taxes payable and income tax liabilities of $135 million for fiscal 2010 was $685 million less than the $820 million decrease for fiscal 2009. This was driven by a fiscal 2010 current income tax expense of $196 million versus a fiscal 2009 current income tax benefit of $413 million. The fiscal 2009 current income tax benefit was primarily the result of audit settlements with the IRS. Offsetting the lower increase in income taxes payable somewhat was a deferred income tax expense of $8 million for fiscal 2010 versus $247 million for fiscal 2009. Two significant non cash reconciliation items contributed to the lower net cash from operations metric. Unrealized foreign exchange gain/loss movements were $28 million of gains for fiscal 2010 compared to $98 million of losses for fiscal 2009. This result was driven by trends in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily movement in the British pound. Also, depreciation and amortization amounts for fiscal 2010 were $114 million less than 2009. The decreases occurred primarily in the first half of the year, driven by lower levels of operations and efforts by the company to limit capital spending. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $86 million more than fiscal 2009. The decrease was driven by higher pension contributions of $124 million as well as lower additions to pension liabilities for the recognition of pension expense, offset by increases in other current liabilities. 29 Investing Cash Flow Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2011 increased $102 million compared to fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to increase in payments for business acquisitions of $153 million, higher purchases of property and equipment and corporate assets of $85 million, partially offset by greater proceeds from two divestitures of $105 million and lower cash flow associated with outsourcing contracts of $38 million. In fiscal 2010, investing cash outflows of $790 million decreased approximately $248 million compared to fiscal 2009. The decrease was driven by reduced purchases of computer equipment, lower acquisition activity, and higher other investing inflows of $121 million, $95 million, and $34 million, respectively. The higher inflow from other investing activities was driven by $43 million from the liquidation of an equity investment and $25 million from the sale of the companys former headquarters facility in El Segundo, California. Financing Cash Flow Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2011 was $1,676 million, an increase of $1,189 million from fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to repayment of the $1.5 billion credit facility in the third quarter, repurchase of $65 million of the Companys outstanding common stock in the fourth quarter under the previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, and payment of cash dividends of $77 million. Cash used in financing activities was $487 million for fiscal 2010, a decrease of $1,229 million from fiscal 2009. The outflow change was primarily due to fiscal 2009s draw down on a $1.5 billion credit facility, offset by the repayment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 of $500 million of long term debt scheduled to mature in June 2011. Fiscal 2009 results include a repayment of $263 million of commercial paper and $320 million of additional payments for lines of credit. Liquidity and Capital Resources The balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,837 million at April 1, 2011, and $2,784 million at April 2, 2010, and total equity increased $1,052 million to $7,560 million during fiscal 2011. At the end of fiscal 2011, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 25.4%, reduced from 36.5% at the end of fiscal 2010, and from 43.0% at the end of fiscal 2009. The decrease in the debt ratio for fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of the repayment of the $1.5 billion line of credit in the third quarter. The decrease in the debt ratio for fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the $500 million term note repayment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. The following table summarizes the Companys debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year end 2011 and 2010. Amount in millions April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010 Debt $ 2,579 $ 3,744 Equity 7,560 6,508 Total capitalization $ 10,139 $ 10,252 Debt to total capitalization 25.4 % 36.5 % At April 1, 2011, the Company had $29 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $141 million of current maturities and $2,409 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 1, 2011. At April 2, 2010, the Company had $21 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $54 million of current maturities and $3,669 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 2, 2010. On March 18, 2011, the Company entered into a new committed line of credit providing $1.5 billion of long term commercial paper backup which replaced the existing $1.5 billion line of credit that would have expired on July 12, 2012. The new line of credit expires on March 18, 2015. This line requires the Company to: (1) maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (2) not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The Company is in full compliance with these requirements. 30 On December 13, 2010, CSCs Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $1 billion in share repurchases of the Companys outstanding common stock (2011 Repurchase Program). In fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares in the open market for approximately $65 million according to SEC rule 10 b18. The timing, volume, and nature of future share repurchases will be at the discretion of management, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. CSCs Board has not established an end date for the 2011 Repurchase Program. In fiscal 2011, the Company commenced paying quarterly cash dividends to its common stockholders. During fiscal 2011 dividends of $0.70 per share or $108 million were declared of which $77 million was paid out. The Company has sufficient liquidity and expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends. On April 1, 2011, the Company announced an agreement to acquire iSoft Group Limited, a provider of advanced healthcare IT solutions at A$0.17 per share, which will compliment its healthcare integration services and software products. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 subject to various approvals. The Companys total liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents plus any borrowing availability under its credit facility. As of April 1, 2011, the Companys total liquidity was approximately $3.3 billion because as of April 1, 2011, the Company had no borrowings against the 2015 credit facility. Continued uncertainty in the global economic conditions may affect the Companys business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize, defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect operating cash flow. Liquidity Risk The Company is exposed to liquidity risk from operations and from the Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets. The Companys exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the Companys performance as well as customer acceptance. For example, the Company and the U.K. National Health Service (NHS) are parties to a 2.9 billion (approximately $5.4 billion at originally announced exchange rate) contract under which the Company is developing and deploying an integrated electronic patient records system. The NHS contract was amended in April 2009 and the parties have entered into variation agreements subsequent to the 2009 amendment agreeing to various operational terms and conditions. The 2009 amendment included mutual releases of all claims existing at the time of the amendment. Since 2010, as part of the U.K. governments austerity program and to address delays in development and deployments, the Company and NHS have discussed modification of the contract scope in order to reduce the total contract value by 500 million or $800 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, additional scope modification and total contract value reduction were discussed, bringing the combined total contract value reduction to 764 million or $1,222 million which would reduce the total contract value to approximately 2.1 billion or $3.4 billion at current exchange rate. Terms related to this scope modification and contract value reduction are included in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) described below. Since signing the 2009 contract amendment various disputes have arisen between the parties, primarily related to delays in development and deployment of the Lorenzo software product, the principal software product under the contract owned and licensed by the Companys subcontractor, iSoft Group Limited. NHS has notified the Company of various alleged events of default under the contract related to these delays and other alleged operational issues. In response, the Company has cured or is preparing to cure the alleged events of default, asserted that failures and breaches of contract on the part of NHS have caused these delays and issues, paid certain immaterial amounts as delay deductions into escrow under the contract for final resolution as part of the expected contract amendment, or otherwise disputed these allegations. Except as described below with regard to NHS allegations related to Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust (Pennine), when NHS has notified the Company of alleged events of default it has generally reserved its rights without demanding, pursuing or otherwise asserting further remedies. On February 4, 2011, NHS formally notified the Company that it believes the Companys failure to achieve a key milestone related to the Pennine Lorenzo deployment by January 28, 2011, constitutes a breach of contract and NHS is considering its position on termination of all or parts of the contract; however, NHS subsequently clarified that its notice was not intended to suggest that termination is the only option which it is considering and, in fact, NHS is considering the full range of options it believes are available to NHS. The Company has disputed the alleged breach. NHS is not at this time actively pursuing this claim under the dispute resolution procedures of the contract. Pennine subsequently elected not to continue with the Lorenzo deployment; however, NHS and the Company are jointly working to replace Pennine with another mental health care trust which would implement the Lorenzo system. Notwithstanding this dispute, both NHS and the Company have continued discussions with the intention of finalizing the terms of the MOU. 31 As described above, NHS and the Company have been in discussions since 2010 regarding an MOU which would set forth an agreement in principle to the key terms of a reduction. Beginning in the second half of fiscal year 2011, the MOU discussions have also included negotiation of terms and conditions which would form the basis for the parties future obligations under the contract and final resolution of all claims and disputes between the parties. Negotiation of the terms of the MOU are substantially complete and are subject to final government review and approvals. The MOU generally represents a non binding agreement in principle; however, it includes a legally binding standstill agreement which provides that while the parties are negotiating a contract amendment to implement the terms of the MOU, neither party will pursue any claims against the other party. As of April 1, 2011, the Company had a net investment in the contract of approximately $1.03 billion, which includes $240 million of receivables, $1,130 million of contractual work in progress recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, $320 million of advance contract payments recorded in deferred revenue, and $60 million of dedicated computer equipment. As a result of the expected contract amendment, the Company estimates that total contract value will be reduced by 764 million ($1,222 million). The contract term is expected to be extended one year to June 2017 and the Company estimates revenue of 1.5 to 2.0 billion ($2.4 to $3.2 billion) over that remaining term. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, the Company recorded a contract inception to date adjustment reducing inception to date profit on the contract by $57 million and reduced the estimated margin rate for the remainder of the contract period, primarily due to increases in cost estimates for deployments, schedule delays and a reduced number of contractually required deployments under the expected contract amendment. These adjustments reflect the Companys estimated cost to complete the contract under the terms of the expected contract amendment as reflected in the MOU. With these amendments, the contract remains profitable and the Company expects to recover its investment. Future events, however, could result in a charge to reduce the contract profitability recognized to date and impair the Companys net investment in the contract, a reduction in future profitability or a material adverse impact on the Companys cash flows. On April 1, 2011, pursuant to the contract, NHS made an advance payment to the Company of 200 million ($320 million) related to the forecasted charges expected by the Company during fiscal year 2012. The advance payment is secured by performance bonds obtained by the Company. The advance payment arrangement provides, as one of its conditions, that the Company could be required to repay the advance payment upon NHS demand on September 30, 2011, if the parties are not progressing satisfactorily toward completion of the expected contract amendment. NHS has the right to terminate the contract for convenience, in which case NHS would owe significant termination fees to the Company and the Company would have claims against NHS for compensation due to delays and excess costs caused by NHS or for contractual deployment delay remedies. The Company believes that NHS, when considering its alternatives of maintaining or terminating the contract, will consider costs and risks that NHS may incur over and above those related to termination fees or damages payable to the Company and the associated legal processes, including the cost of initiating and managing a public tender procedure to obtain one or more suitable replacement suppliers, the operational risk of switching suppliers at this stage in the contract with the Company, the cost of alternative suppliers, and the cost of obtaining exit management services from the Company to ensure an orderly transition to one or more replacement suppliers. If NHS elected to terminate the contract for convenience, the total amount recoverable by the Company from termination fees payable by NHS and from claims by the Company is uncertain and it is possible the Companys total recovery would be materially less than the net asset value associated with the contract. Future deployment delays caused by the Company could increase this shortfall materially until a contract amendment is signed. There can be no assurance that the Company and NHS will successfully conclude negotiations and enter into a contract amendment or, if a contract amendment is negotiated and entered into, that the contract amendment as finally negotiated will reflect the terms of the MOU. The time required to complete a contract amendment is uncertain and while the Company expects completion, signing and approval of a contract amendment in fiscal year 2012, further unexpected delays could occur. The final terms of any contract amendment, a significant delay in completing a contract amendment, failure to conclude a contract amendment, or a termination of the contract by NHS for convenience could result in an impairment of the Companys net investment in the contract and have an material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, these events could result in a goodwill impairment charge (see Note 9). If the parties do not successfully conclude a contract amendment, either or both parties could elect to assert claims against the other for breach of contract or similar claims. Subject to a legal obligation to mitigate its damages and subject to contractual limits of the Companys liability, NHS could elect in this event to seek delay damages under the contract or terminate the contract and seek damages from the Company, including alleged damages for the cost of a replacement system and for unrealized savings and benefits under the contract. The Company could assert claims against NHS for breach of contract and seek damages from NHS, including compensation due to delays and excess costs caused by NHS or for contractual deployment delay remedies. If NHS wrongfully seeks to terminate the contract and refuses to withdraw its termination notice following the Companys demand, the Company could assert a claim for wrongful termination and seek damages for repudiatory breach of contract. Although the parties have not asserted claims formally in any arbitration or other legal proceeding, there can be no assurance that in any such proceeding NHS will not assert claims against the Company for damages in a material amount. The Company believes that the NHS contract is enforceable and that NHS has no existing right to terminate the contract. However, contractual disputes and litigation of this nature are complex and inherently uncertain and the Companys position is subject to the ongoing review and evaluation of new facts and information which may come to the Companys attention. If a contractual dispute or litigation ensues, the outcome is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the Company would prevail or that the NHS would not obtain a judgment and a material reward of damages against the Company which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial statements. 32 The Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the Companys financial position. On March 18, 2011, the Company entered into a new committed line of credit providing $1.5 billion of long term commercial paper backup which replaced an existing $1.5 billion line of credit that would have expired on July 12, 2012. The new line of credit expires on March 18, 2015. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company was able to borrow against commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs. As of April 1, 2011, there are no borrowings outstanding against commercial paper. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities and current cash balances. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of April 1, 2011: (Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2014 & Thereafter Total Performance guarantees: Surety bonds $ 29 $ $ $ 29 Letters of credit 494 1 19 514 Standby letters of credit 64 5 69 Foreign subsidiary debt guarantees 625 625 Total $ 1,212 $ 1 $ 24 $ 1,237 See Note 16 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The following table summarizes the Companys payments on contractual obligations by period as of April 1, 2011: (Amounts in millions) 1 Year or Less 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Total Long term debt $ $ 998 $ $ 997 $ 1,995 Interest on fixed rate debt 119 184 130 130 563 Capital lease obligations 104 187 92 62 445 Bank debt 29 29 Operating leases 277 369 164 89 899 Minimum purchase obligations 271 329 102 5 707 Other long term liabilities 35 49 26 110 Liability related to unrecognized tax benefits 38 16 54 Total $ 873 $ 2,132 $ 514 $ 1,283 $ 4,802 The liability related to unrecognized tax benefits of $54 million included in the table above is associated with expected tax audit settlements for fiscal years 2005 through 2007. Additional liability has been excluded from the table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined. Regarding minimum purchase obligations included above, the Company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software, hardware, telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing, committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities. The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or the entire shortfall. During fiscal 2012, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $179 million to pension and $11 million to postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal 2012 because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations. During fiscal 2011, pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to $239 million, a decrease of $106 million from $345 million in fiscal 2010. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 33 Dividends In fiscal 2011, CSCs Board of Directors instituted payment of cash dividends to common stockholders. During the year, quarterly dividends were declared which for the full fiscal year aggregated to $0.70 per share or $108 million. Of the total dividends declared, $77 million was paid in fiscal 2011 and the balance of $31 million was paid on April 15, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues. Changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. We have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates relate to: revenue recognition, cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill; assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition The majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates. Revenue from our fixed unit price contracts, time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time. However, for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting, which is less than nine percent of the Companys revenues, the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation. Under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved. Costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved. The method requires estimates of revenues, costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. Modifications to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. We routinely negotiate such contract modifications. Many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers. The total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value. These relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value. Once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements, revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered. Estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception. Revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization If significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results. 34 Capitalization of outsourcing contract costs Certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set up costs, and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of assets acquired (i.e., premiums). Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of assets acquired from a customer in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion, to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Capitalization of software development costs We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations. Estimates used to determine income tax expense We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We also must analyze income tax reserves, as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination. Assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments in determination of acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining their fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations can be based on significant estimates provided by the Company, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual results versus estimates, could result in material impacts to earnings. 35 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 (FAS No. 142) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and reductions in growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting units fair value to its carrying value. If a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment of goodwill may exist. The Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of income approach and market approach. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method. In applying the discounted cash flow method, the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a weighted average cost of capital. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, a discount rate is applied based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit and its underlying forecast. Cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of economic and market conditions including revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting units operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. If the fair value of the reporting unit derived using the market approach were significantly different from the fair value estimated in the income approach, the Company would reevaluate assumptions used in the two models. The fair values determined by the market approach and income approach as described above, were weighted to determine the fair value for each reporting unit. The weightings assigned to each reporting unit were primarily driven by two factors: 1) the number of comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach, and 2) the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step of the impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss. The amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal growth rates, capital expenditures, as well as discount rates. Estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. In addition, judgments and assumptions are required for allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit. Although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain and can vary from actual results. Future events relating to the NHS contract negotiations could adversely impact the Companys estimates and assumptions relating to future cash flows and determination of fair value of the related reporting units, which may result in a goodwill impairment charge (see Notes 9 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements). Assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities We offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits (SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. We consider current market conditions such as changes in interest rates, in determining discount rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions. 36 The expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the asset mix of the plan and other factors. Please see Note 12 for more details. The weighted average of the expected long term rate of return, for all plans, on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2011 and 2010 pension plan valuations was 7.5% and 7.8%, respectively. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percentage increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the fiscal 2011 net periodic pension cost by approximately $19 million. An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal 2011 net periodic pension cost was 5.8% compared to 7.4% used for fiscal 2010. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the fiscal 2011 net periodic pension cost by approximately $14 million, or increased it by approximately $7 million, respectively. Some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts. The accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year. Such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time. For CSC, market returns in fiscal 2011 caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. However, declining discount rates in fiscal 2011, which resulted in higher benefit obligation growth, served to offset some of the positive impact of favorable asset returns in fiscal 2011. Pension assets as a percentage of projected benefit obligations increased during the fiscal year. Declining discount rates in fiscal 2010, which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligation growth, served to partially offset the impact of positive asset returns in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, a number of U.K. pension plans were frozen. And as a result, lower pension obligations were recognized in 2011 than in 2010. The effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal 2011 was to decrease pension liability by $180 million, increase non current assets by $7 million, and decrease accumulated comprehensive loss by $86 million ($62 million, net of taxes). At the end of fiscal 2010, a number of our pension plans had PBOs in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets, due mostly to declining discount rates, and as a result, higher pension obligations were recognized in 2010 than in 2009. The effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement in fiscal 2010 was to increase pension liability by $180 million, increase non current asset by $7 million, and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by $384 million ($264 million, net of taxes). Assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation We are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results. 37 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. For the year ended April 1, 2011, a hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial conditions. Foreign Currency As a large global organization the Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenue is received, and any related short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. Thus, by generally matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company is able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings. However, as the Company has increased its use of offshore support in recent years, it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations. The Company has policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. For accounting purposes, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and thus all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other (income) expense. The Company also uses foreign currency options to manage its exposure to economic risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. These financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year. They are used to offset existing foreign currency positions or as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes. During fiscal 2011, approximately 37% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. The Company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings. For the year ended April 1, 2011, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would have impacted revenue by approximately 4% or $591 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by approximately $24 million for the year ended April 1, 2011. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. As of April 1, 2011, the Company had approximately $1,537 million of non U.S. dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $29 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 38
