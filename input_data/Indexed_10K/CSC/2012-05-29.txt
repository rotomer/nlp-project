Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Companys consolidated financial statements and associated notes as of and for the year ended March 30, 2012. There are three primary objectives of this discussion: 1.Provide a narrative on the consolidated financial statements, as presented through the eyes of management;2.Enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes by providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed; and3.Provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results. To achieve these objectives, the management discussion and analysis is presented in the following sections: Overview includes a description of the Companys business, how it earns revenue and generates cash, as well as a discussion of the economic and industry factors, key business drivers, key performance indicators and fiscal 2012 highlights. Results of Operations discusses year over year changes to operating results for fiscal 2010 to 2012, describing the factors affecting revenue on a consolidated and reportable segment basis, including new contracts, acquisitions and divestitures and currency impacts, and also by describing the factors affecting changes in the major cost and expense categories. Financial Condition discusses causes of changes in cash flows and describes the Companys liquidity and available capital resources. Critical Accounting Estimates discusses the significant accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. OverviewCSC provides information technology and business process outsourcing, consulting, systems integration and other information technology services to its customers. The Company targets the delivery of these services within three broad lines of business or sectors: North American Public Sector (NPS), Managed Services Sector (MSS), and Business Solutions and Services (BSS). The Companys reportable segments are as follows:The NPS segment provides services to the U.S. federal government and its agencies, civil departments and branches of military, and operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements, including Federal Acquisition Regulations, Cost Accounting Standards and audits by various U.S. federal agencies. The MSS segment provides large scale infrastructure and application outsourcing solutions offerings as well as mid size services delivery to customers globally.The BSS segment provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services, business process outsourcing, and intellectual property based software solutions. For additional information regarding our business segments, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.21Economic and Industry Factors The Companys results of operations are impacted by economic conditions generally, including macroeconomic conditions. We are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us. A severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate. This may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations. Particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty, we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations. Our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve, as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients. The ability to identify and capitalize on these market and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance. Revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients. Our ability to add value to clients, and therefore generate revenues, depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis. The BSS and MSS segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors. The economic environment in the regions CSC serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on information technology (IT) projects. CSC is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors, including service offerings and flexibility. Management monitors industry factors including relative market shares, growth rates, billing rates, staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates and foreign currency rates. Outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships. Long term, complex outsourcing contracts, including their consulting components, require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work, in order to meet clients evolving business needs and our performance expectations. More recently, the Company has implemented a strategy of promoting and selling defined solutions that require less customization and benefit from leveraged delivery at scale. Such solutions include our portfolio of Cloud based Infrastructure as a Service offerings, managed applications services and a range of discrete offerings for computing, storage, mobility and networking services. The NPS segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics. All U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be modified, curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change. In the event that a contract is terminated for convenience, the Company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed. Shifting priorities of the U.S. government can also impact the future of projects. Management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts, legislative activity, budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations. Business Drivers Revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more. Factors affecting revenue include the Companys ability to successfully: bid on and win new contract awards, satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes, compete on services offered, delivery models offered, technical ability and innovation, quality, flexibility, global reach, experience, and results created, andidentify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues. Earnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and, in addition, the Companys ability to: control costs, particularly labor costs, subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare, pension 22and general and administrative costs, anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses, accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals, develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore, and manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations.Cash flows are affected by the above earnings factors and, in addition, by the following factors: timely management of receivables and payables, investment opportunities available, particularly related to business acquisitions, dispositions and large outsourcing contracts, andthe ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments.Key Performance Indicators The Company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means, with the primary financial measures including new contract wins, revenue growth, margins, and cash flow. New contract wins: In addition to being a primary driver of future revenue, new contract wins also provide management an assessment of the Companys ability to compete. The total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or re competed contracts, as well as numerous external factors. Revenue growth: Year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins, and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts. With a wide array of services offered, the Company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers. In addition, incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs, particularly overhead and other indirect costs, thus potentially improving profit margins. Foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth. Margins: Margins reflect the Companys performance on contracts and ability to control costs. While the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles, a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability. Although the majority of the Companys costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues, increased use of offshore support also exposes CSC to additional margin fluctuations.Cash flow: Primary drivers of the Companys cash flow are earnings provided by the Companys operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings. Also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances. The Company also regularly reviews the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) cash flow measurements of operating, investing and financing cash flows, as well as the non GAAP measure free cash flow. 23Fiscal 2012 HighlightsFiscal 2012 results were adversely impacted by certain large adjustments that reduced revenue and increased costs. These significant adjustments are listed below and described in detail later in this section and also in the Results of Operations section. Impact of Adjustment(Amounts in millions) Favorable/(Unfavorable) Revenues Costs Loss from continuing operations before taxesSpecified contract charge $(204) $(1,281) $(1,485)Settlement charge (42) (227) (269)Restructuring costs (140) (140)Goodwill impairment (2,745) (2,745)Asset impairments (156) (156)Net adjustments on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method (83) (148) (231)Legal and other fees on SEC and Audit Committee investigations (67) (67)Transaction and transition costs associated with acquisition of iSOFT (23) (23)The key operating results for fiscal 2012 include: Revenues decreased $165 million or 1.0%, and decreased 2.9% on a constant currency basis(1). Of the 2.9% constant currency decrease, 1.5% was due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the charge associated with a U.K.s National Health Service (NHS) contract and the settlement of claims associated with a U.S. Government contract. The revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue of 1.7% from the fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 acquisitions. Loss from continuing operations before taxes was $4,347 million, compared to income from continuing operations before taxes of $968 million in fiscal 2011, a decrease of $5,315 million, or 549.1%.Operating income(2) decreased 202.8% to a loss of $1,251 million as compared to operating income of $1,217 million in fiscal 2011, and operating income margins decreased to (7.9)% from 7.6% in the fiscal 2011.Net loss attributable to CSC common shareholders was $4,242 million, a decrease of $4,982 million, or 673.2%, as compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) was $(27.37) for fiscal 2012, a decrease of $32.10 as compared to the prior year. For fiscal 2012, diluted EPS was comprised of $(27.38) from continuing operations and $0.01 from discontinued operations, as compared to $4.51 and $0.22, respectively, in the prior year. During the second quarter, the Company reached a definitive settlement agreement with the U.S. government in its contract claims asserted under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), and recorded a pre tax charge of $269 million, which included a $42 million reduction of revenue. The charge reflected the write down of claim related assets (unbilled receivables and deferred costs), offset by cash received of $277 million and the estimated fair value of a contract extension of $45 million. During the third quarter, the Company recorded a charge associated with the U.K. NHS contract of $1,485 million, which included a $204 million reduction of revenue.The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2,745 million during fiscal 2012. In the second quarter, the Company recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $2,685 million, of which $2,074 million related to the MSS segment and $611 million related to the BSS segment. During the third quarter, the Company recorded a $60 million goodwill impairment, all of which related to the BSS segment.24During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $140 million, of which $108 million is related to the MSS segment, $31 million is related to the BSS segment, and $1 million is related to the NPS segment.During fiscal 2012, the Company recorded $231 million of net adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and $156 million of impairments of assets related primarily to outsourcing contracts with service delivery issues.The Company announced contract awards of $19.3 billion, including new MSS segment awards of $9.5 billion, NPS segment awards of $6.0 billion, and BSS segment awards of $3.8 billion. Total backlog(3) at the end of fiscal 2012 was $36.4 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion as compared to the backlog at the end of fiscal 2011 of $36.0 billion. Of the total $36.4 billion backlog, $10.2 billion is expected to be realized as revenue in fiscal 2013. Of the total $36.4 billion, $12.3 billion is not yet funded. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)(4) was 70 days at March 30, 2012, an improvement from 79 days at April 1, 2011. Debt to total capitalization ratio(5) was 49.2% at year end, an increase of 23.8% points from 25.4% at fiscal 2011 year end, reflecting the current year net loss attributable to CSC common shareholders of $4,242 million with corresponding impact on CSC stockholders equity.Cash provided by operating activities was $1,176 million, as compared to $1,564 million during fiscal 2011. Cash used in investing activities was $1,308 million, as compared to $892 million during fiscal 2011. Cash used in financing activities was $581 million, as compared to $1,676 million during fiscal 2011. Free cash flow(6) of $59 million in fiscal 2012 was down from $629 million in fiscal 2011, driven primarily by the Companys operating performance and net cash outflows associated with a U.K. NHS contract, partially offset by cash received from the U.S. government upon settlement of contract claims. (1) Selected references are made on a constant currency basis so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates, thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period. Financial results on a constant currency basis are calculated by translating current period activity into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior periods currency conversion rates. This approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. (2) Operating income is a non U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure used by management to assess performance at the segments and on a consolidated basis. The Companys definition of such measure may differ from other companies. We define operating income as revenue less costs of services, depreciation and amortization expense, and segment general and administrative (G&A) expense, excluding corporate G&A. Management compensates for the limitations of this non GAAP measure by also reviewing income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes, which includes costs excluded from the operating income definition such as goodwill impairment, corporate G&A, interest and other income. A reconciliation of consolidated operating (loss) income to (loss) income from continuing operations before taxes is as follows: Twelve Months Ended(Amounts in millions) March 30, 2012 April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010Operating (loss) income $(1,251) $1,217 $1,395Corporate G&A (219) (138) (168)Interest expense (176) (168) (252)Interest Income 38 37 27Goodwill impairment (2,745) Other income (expense), net 6 20 20(Loss) income from continuing operations before taxes $(4,347) $968 $1,022(3) Backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly long term contracts, based on customer commitments that the Company believes to be firm. Backlog value is based on contract commitments, managements judgment and assumptions about volume of services, availability of customer funding and other factors. Backlog estimates for government contracts include both the funded and unfunded portions 25and all of the option periods. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements.For NPS, announced award values for competitive indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity (IDIQ) awards represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract. Announced values for non competitive IDIQ awards represent managements estimate at the award date. Business awards for MSS are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates, and include option years. BSS award values are based on firm commitments. Beginning in fiscal 2012, we revised our estimation of BSS awards to account for larger business solution and service awards. Prior period awards and backlog have been revised to conform to the current year presentation. (4) DSO is calculated as total receivables at the fiscal period end divided by revenue per day. Revenue per day equals total revenues divided by the number of days in the fiscal period. Total receivables includes unbilled receivables but excludes tax receivables and long term receivables.(5) Debt to total capitalization ratio is defined as total current and long term debt divided by total debt and equity, including noncontrolling interest. (6) Free cash flow is a non GAAP measure and the Companys definition of such measure may differ from that of other companies. We define free cash flow as equal to the sum of (1) operating cash flows, (2) investing cash flows, excluding business acquisitions, dispositions and investments (including short term investments and purchase or sale of available for sale securities) and (3) payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings. CSCs free cash flow measure does not distinguish operating cash flows from investing cash flows as they are required to be presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for operating and investing cash flows as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is one of the factors CSC management uses in reviewing the overall performance of the business. Management compensates for the limitations of this non GAAP measure by also reviewing the GAAP measures of operating, investing and financing cash flows as well as debt levels measured by the debt to total capitalization ratio.A reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is presented below: Twelve Months Ended(Amounts in millions) March 30, 2012 April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010Free cash flow $59 $629 $811Net cash used in investing activities 1,308 892 790Acquisitions, net of cash acquired (374) (158) (5)Business dispositions 2 119 14Short term investments 4 (9) Payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings 177 91 33Net cash provided by operating activities $1,176 $1,564 $1,643Net cash used in investing activities $(1,308) $(892) $(790)Net cash used in provided by financing activities $(581) $(1,676) $(487)The Company has developed a broad, long term revenue base which includes customers spread across multiple industries and geographic regions as well as service lines. A significant amount of CSCs revenue is derived from long term contracts including information technology outsourcing, build and maintain engagements and U.S. federal government engagements. This provides the Company with a base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens. The Companys significant wins and scope extensions during fiscal 2012 included the following: NPS: U.S. Army ($1.0 billion)State of Maryland ($297 million)U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ($291 million)MSS:BAE Systems ($800 million)Educational Testing Service (over $200 million)BSS:Financial services industry clients ($1.6 billion)Technology and consumer services industry clients ($863 million)26Health services industry clients ($497 million)Cash and cash equivalents at March 30, 2012, was approximately $1.1 billion, down from $1.8 billion at April 1, 2011, a $744 million decrease. The decrease was a result of financing and investing cash outflows of $581 million and $1,308 million, respectively, during fiscal 2012, offset by operating cash inflows of $1,176 million. Net loss adjusted for non cash charges drove the operating cash inflows, higher purchases of property and equipment and business acquisitions drove the investing cash outflows, and a repayment on the Companys credit facility drove the financing outflows.Cash and cash equivalents at April 1, 2011, was approximately $1.8 billion, down from $2.8 billion at April 2, 2010, a $947 million decrease. The decrease was a result of financing and investing cash outflows of $1.7 billion cash and $892 million, respectively, during fiscal 2011, offset by operating cash inflows of $1.6 billion. Net income drove the operating cash inflows, higher purchases of property and equipment and business acquisitions drove the investing cash outflows, and a repayment on the Companys credit facility drove the financing outflows. Results of Operations Revenues Revenues for the NPS, MSS, and BSS segments for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010 are as follows: Twelve Months Ended March 30, 2012 April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010(Amounts in millions) Amount PercentChange Amount Percent Change AmountNPS $5,703 (5.0)% $6,002 (1.5)% $6,095MSS 6,618 0.5 6,583 2.0 6,451BSS 3,677 3.0 3,570 2.5 3,483Corporate 13 14 17Subtotal 16,011 (1.0) 16,169 0.8 16,046Eliminations (134) (127) (125)Total Revenue $15,877 (1.0)% $16,042 0.8 % $15,921The major factors affecting the percent change in revenues are presented as follows: Twelve Months EndedMarch 30, 2012 vs. April 1, 2011 Acquisitions ApproximateImpact ofCurrencyFluctuations Net InternalGrowth TotalNPS 0.6% (5.6)% (5.0)%MSS 0.9 2.7 % (3.1) 0.5BSS 4.8 3.5 (5.3) 3.0Cumulative Net Percentage 1.7% 1.9 % (4.6)% (1.0)% Twelve Months EndedApril 1, 2011 vs. April 2, 2010 Acquisitions ApproximateImpact ofCurrency Fluctuations Net InternalGrowth TotalNPS 0.2% (1.7)% (1.5)%MSS (0.1)% 2.1 2.0BSS 0.9 (0.2) 1.8 2.5Cumulative Net Percentage 0.3% (0.1)% 0.6 % 0.8 %27North American Public Sector The Companys North American Public Sector segment revenues were derived from the following sources: Twelve Months Ended March 30, 2012 April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010Dollars in millions Amount Percent Change Amount PercentChange AmountDepartment of Defense(1) $3,863 (10.0)% $4,290 (2.8)% $4,414Civil agencies(1) 1,618 7.3 1,508 2.4 1,473Other (2) 222 8.8 204 (1.9) 208Total $5,703 (5.0)% $6,002 (1.5)% $6,095(1) Certain fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 amounts were reclassified from Department of Defense to Civil Agencies to conform to the current year presentation.(2) Other revenues consist of foreign, state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the NPS segment. Fiscal 2012NPS segment revenue decreased $299 million, or 5.0% as compared to fiscal 2011. This decrease was due to its Department of Defense group (DOD) contracts, which had a $427 million, or 10.0% decrease. Partially offsetting the decline in revenue on DOD contracts were increases in revenue from contracts with Civil Agencies (Civil), which had a $110 million, or 7.3% increase, and increases in revenue from Other contracts, which had a $18 million, or 8.8% increase. Fiscal 2012 NPS revenue was adversely impacted by net $29 million of adjustments on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Of such adjustments, $39 million reduced revenue and $10 million increased revenue. The decreases in revenue on DOD contracts, primarily with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force, were due to a combination of completion of existing task orders, a contract termination and net reduction in scope and tasking on other existing contracts. In addition, revenue was adversely impacted by the contract claims settlement with the U.S. Federal Government in the second quarter of $42 million (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and by a $14 million adjustment on a contract with the U.S. Air Force accounted for under the percentage of completion method due to a stop work order.The increase in revenue from Civil Agencies was primarily due to contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Human and Health Services (DHHS) and the Social Security Administration that commenced during the second half of fiscal 2011. These increases were partially offset by revenue that did not recur due to contract completions, primarily the U.S. Census support contract, as well as reduced scope on certain other contracts, primarily with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Transportation, Department of Energy and the Internal Revenue Service.The increase in revenue from Other contracts was primarily due to higher revenue on a contract with a state agency for the development of a healthcare administration system. The higher revenue on this contract was partially offset by a $25 million adverse adjustment resulting from revised estimates under the percentage of completion accounting method. Of the $25 million revenue reduction, $16 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.Many of our government customers continue to experience uncertainty about their fiscal budgets due to the Budget Control Act of 2011. As a result, large program awards are delayed and customers are shifting to smaller and shorter term contracts.NPS won new contracts of $6.0 billion during fiscal 2012 compared to $5.5 billion during fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011NPS segment revenue decreased 1.5%, or $93 million, for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Excluding two small acquisitions made at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2011, revenue decreased 1.7%. DOD revenue 28declined slightly despite higher revenues on several programs. The increases were offset by contract completions, the adverse effects from reduced tasking on two U.S. Army contracts, as well as from the impact of a one time, $65 million revenue benefit in fiscal 2010 from a claim settlement that did not repeat in fiscal 2011. Civil declines came primarily from contracts with the DHHS, the Department of Transportation and the EPA that either ended or experienced reductions in customer spending. One factor affecting the overall year over year revenue decline was an ongoing uncertainty among many government customers about their fiscal budgets and potential budget cuts due to ongoing congressional debates and temporary continuing resolutions on the current budget. Also impacting the year over year change is the increasing trend in contested awards, thereby slowing the ultimate start date of many contracts. For example, CSC won a significant award with the Transportation Security Administration in fiscal 2010 but protests resulted in numerous delays of up to ten months. Another factor affecting many government contractors is the recent renewed government initiative to insource personnel rather than use external providers. The impact was not significant on CSCs results given the nature of the types of services we provide, and we expect a diminished impact in the future as government agencies revisit the costs and benefits of such an initiative. During fiscal 2011, the Company announced federal contract awards with a total value of $5.5 billion compared to $7.1 billion during fiscal 2010. Managed Services SectorFiscal 2012MSS segment revenue increased $35 million, or 0.5% as compared to fiscal 2011. In constant currency, revenue decreased $140 million, or 2.2%. The foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar, the British Pound, the Euro and the Swiss Franc. MSS second quarter acquisition of AppLabs (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) provided revenue of $60 million, or 0.9% of the revenue growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency effects and the acquisition, fiscal 2012 net internal revenue decreased $200 million, or 3.1% as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to net volume and scope reductions of approximately $140 million and contract conclusions and terminations of approximately $270 million, partially offset by revenue from new contracts of approximately $200 million. In addition, revenue was impacted by certain one time adjustments, including adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of $48 million and missed service level metrics of $10 million due to delays on certain outsourcing contracts, partially offset by a favorable adjustment on termination of a contract of $15 million. The MSS year over year revenue trend was also adversely impacted by out of period adjustments. The out of period revenue decreases recorded in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were $7 million and $33 million, respectively (see Notes 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).During fiscal 2012, the Company announced contract awards with a total value of $9.5 billion compared to $5.0 billion during fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 new contracts awards include $5.1 billion of successful recompetes.Fiscal 2011MSS segment revenue grew $132 million, or 2.0% in fiscal 2011, and increased 2.1% excluding foreign currency effects. The overall MSS growth was primarily from a combination of new client engagements won in fiscal 2010 and 2011, which generated approximately $521 million revenue in fiscal 2011, as well as growth on existing accounts which contributed $297 million in year over year growth. Partly offsetting the increases were contract conclusions and terminations of $272 million plus volume and scope reductions on existing accounts totaling $384 million. During fiscal 2011, the Company announced contract awards with a total value of $5.0 billion compared to $8.7 billion during fiscal 2010. 29Business Solutions & Services Fiscal 2012BSS segment revenue increased $107 million, or 3.0% as compared to fiscal 2011. In constant currency, revenue decreased $18 million, or 0.5%. The foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the U.S. dollar against the Australian Dollar, the British Pound and the Euro. The acquisition of iSOFT and the other fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 acquisitions provided $171 million, or 4.8% of the year over year revenue increase. Excluding the effect of foreign currency movements and acquisitions, BSS fiscal 2012 revenue decreased $189 million, or 5.3% over the prior year.The lower net internal fiscal 2012 revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue on the U.K. NHS contract of $233 million, which was adversely impacted by the third quarter $204 million revenue write down (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and by fiscal 2011 milestone revenue of $23 million that did not recur in fiscal 2012. BSS health vertical also had reduced revenue due to continuing softness in the life sciences market and certain project completions in North America. Both of these revenue decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in the other verticals of BSS consulting group. The consulting groups growth was primarily in North America, which offset revenue shortfalls in other regions. The BSS year over year revenue trend was also adversely impacted by out of period adjustments. The out of period revenue adjustments recorded in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were revenue decreases of $15 million and revenue increases of $15 million, respectively (see Notes 2 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).During fiscal 2012, BSS had contract awards of $3.8 billion compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2011.Fiscal 2011BSS segment revenue increased $87 million, or 2.5% in fiscal 2011, and increased 2.7% excluding foreign currency effects. Acquisitions accounted for approximately $29 million or 0.9% of the year over year increase. The remaining growth resulted primarily from increases in the BSS consulting business in financial services, which grew $58 million year over year, and from other consulting operations which were up $30 million, excluding acquisitions. Additional growth came from an Asia hardware resale business and an Australian IT staffing operation which contributed $23 million. Offsetting the increases was a revenue decline on the NHS by $46 million due to delays in milestone deliverables. The financial services group benefited from increased business process outsourcing services as well as from higher software and project related services. Other than healthcare related operations, other consulting operations grew $60 million and were up by double digit rates in select regions, including Europes western region, Brazil and Australia, and were also up slightly in the U.S., while down in other regions across Europe. Healthcare related consulting operations were down $30 million, however, primarily due to the conclusion of a major contract with a large insurance company and continued uncertainty in the U.S. marketplace regarding healthcare reform. During fiscal 2011, BSS had contract awards of $3.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2010.30Costs and Expenses The Companys total costs and expenses were as follows: Twelve Months Ended Percentage of RevenueDollars in millions 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010Costs of services (excludes depreciation and amortization, specified contract charge, settlement charge and restructuring costs of $137 (2012)) $13,406 $12,925 $12,618 84.4 % 80.6 % 79.2 %Cost of services specified contract charge (excludes amount charged to revenue of $204) 1,281 8.1 Cost of services settlement charge (excludes amount charged to revenue of $42) 227 1.4 Selling, general and administrative (excludes restructuring costs of $3 (2012)) 1,141 965 981 7.2 6.0 6.2Depreciation and amortization 1,152 1,073 1,095 7.3 6.7 6.9Restructuring costs 140 0.9 Goodwill impairment 2,745 17.2 Interest expense, net 138 131 225 0.9 0.8 1.4Other (income) expense, net (6) (20) (20) (0.1) (0.1)Total $20,224 $15,074 $14,899 127.4 % 94.0 % 93.6 %Fiscal 2012Total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2012 were 127.4%, up from 94.0% in fiscal 2011. The increase in the total costs and expenses ratio was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge, the specified contract charge and the settlement charge, all of which were recorded prior to the fourth quarter, and the restructuring costs recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The total costs and expenses ratio was also impacted by certain out of period adjustments recorded during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, as described below. Cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization, the specified contract charge, the settlement charge and the fourth quarter restructuring costs of $137 million, as a percentage of revenue increased 3.8% points to 84.4% from 80.6% in fiscal 2011, primarily as a result of certain adverse fourth quarter adjustments recorded by MSS as further discussed below. Selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding restructuring charges of $3 million, as a percentage of revenue increased 1.2 percentage points primarily due to the legal fees associated with the SEC and the Audit Committees investigations of $67 million. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue increased 0.6 percentage points primarily due to higher capital expenditures on existing and new contracts. Fiscal 2011Costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2011 was 94.0%, up from 93.6% in fiscal 2010. Cost of services rose 1.4 percentage points as a result of adverse adjustments in MSS and BSS including out of period adjustments primarily in MSS as further discussed below. Selling, general and administrative expense ratio and depreciation and amortization ratio both improved 0.2 percentage points as a result of ongoing cost and capital expenditure reduction initiatives. Other income of $20 million was primarily due to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and other miscellaneous gains.31Investigations and Out of Period Adjustments Summary of Audit Committee and SEC Investigations Related to the Out of Period AdjustmentsBackgroundAs previously disclosed in fiscal 2011, the Company initiated an investigation into out of period adjustments resulting from certain accounting errors in our MSS segment, primarily involving accounting irregularities in the Nordic region. Initially, the investigation was conducted by Company personnel, but outside Company counsel and forensic accountants retained by such counsel later assisted in the Companys investigation. On January 28, 2011, the Company was notified by the SECs Division of Enforcement that it had commenced a formal civil investigation relating to these matters, which investigation has subsequently been expanded to other matters subsequently identified by the SEC, including matters specified in subpoenas issued to the Company from time to time by the SECs Division of Enforcement as well as matters under investigation by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, as further described below. The Company is cooperating in the SECs investigation. On May 2, 2011, the Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation into the matters relating to the MSS segment and the Nordic region, matters identified by subpoenas issued by the SECs Division of Enforcement, and certain other accounting matters identified by the Audit Committee and retained independent counsel to represent CSC on behalf of, and under the exclusive direction of, the Audit Committee in connection with such independent investigation. Independent counsel has retained forensic accountants to assist their work. Independent counsel also represents CSC on behalf of, and under the exclusive direction of, the Audit Committee in connection with the investigation by the SECs Division of Enforcement.The Audit Committees investigation has been expanded to encompass (i) the Companys operations in Australia, (ii) certain aspects of the Companys accounting practices within its Americas Outsourcing operation, and (iii) certain of the Companys accounting practices that involve the percentage of completion accounting method, including the Companys contract with NHS. In the course of the Audit Committees expanded investigation, accounting errors and irregularities have been identified. As a result, certain personnel have been reprimanded, suspended, terminated and or resigned. All of these investigative activities are ongoing. Any out of period adjustments identified, including items that self corrected within a fiscal year, by the Company to date are hereinafter identified in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes the SEC also has expanded its investigation into the foregoing areas as well as into certain related disclosure matters. The SECs investigative activities are ongoing. In addition, the SECs Division of Corporation Finance has issued comment letters to the Company requesting, among other things, additional information regarding its previously disclosed adjustments in connection with the above referenced accounting errors, the Companys conclusions relating to materiality of such adjustments, and the Companys analysis of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting. The Division of Corporation Finances comment letter process is ongoing, and the Company is continuing to cooperate with that process.The investigations being conducted by the SECs Division of Enforcement and the Audit Committee as well as the review of our financial disclosures by the SECs Division of Corporation Finance are continuing and could identify other accounting errors, irregularities or other areas of review. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal and accounting expenditures, and a significant amount of time of our senior management has been focused on these matters that otherwise would have been focused on the growth of the Company. We are unable to predict how long the Division of Enforcements and Audit Committees investigations will continue or whether, at the conclusion of its investigation, the SEC will seek to impose fines or take other actions against us. In addition, we are unable to predict the timing of the completion of the Division of Corporation Finances review of our financial disclosures or the outcome of such review. Publicity surrounding the foregoing or any enforcement action as a result of the SECs investigation, even if ultimately resolved favorably for us, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded $52 million of pre tax adjustments that should have been recorded in prior fiscal years. The total out of period adjustments recorded in fiscal 2011 were comprised of $92 million of charges reducing income from continuing operations before taxes originating out of the Companys MSS operations in the Nordic region, 32and $40 million of adjustments increasing income from continuing operations before taxes, with $36 million of the $40 million within MSS.The Company recorded $79 million of out of period adjustments in fiscal 2012, which included $13 million of charges in the Nordic region, $23 million of charges in the Companys operations in Australia, and $25 million of charges originating from the NHS contract in the Companys BSS segment. Additionally, $16 million and $2 million of charges were recorded in the NPS segment and other operations of the Company, respectively. The fiscal 2012 out of period adjustments primarily related to the Companys MSS and BSS segments, with $37 million and $26 million within MSS and BSS, respectively.Certain additional items have been identified but not yet recorded related to the NHS contract that could have an effect on the amount and the allocation of the out of period adjustments for fiscal 2012 and prior fiscal years. Management does not believe that the effect of these additional items is material to the Companys financial statements. However, the investigation into these additional items is ongoing, and the amount could change and the allocation across years is likely to change. The rollover impact on income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes of the recorded out of period adjustments is attributable to the following prior fiscal years: Increase/(Decrease)(Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2011 Adjustments Fiscal 2012 Adjustments Total AdjustmentsFiscal 2012 $ $79 $79Fiscal 2011 52 (29) 23Fiscal 2010 (48) (9) (57)Fiscal 2009 (unaudited) (3) (27) (30)Prior fiscal years (unaudited) (1) (14) (15)Nordic RegionAs noted above, during fiscal 2011, the Company commenced an investigation into accounting irregularities in the Nordic Region. Based upon the Companys investigation, review of the underlying documentation for certain transactions and balances, review of contract documentation and discussions with Nordic personnel, the Company attributes the majority of the $92 million pre tax adjustments recorded in the Nordic region in fiscal 2011 to accounting irregularities arising from suspected intentional misconduct by certain former employees in our Danish subsidiaries. The Company attributes the $13 million in pre tax adjustments recorded in the Nordic region in fiscal 2012 to miscellaneous errors and not to any accounting irregularities or intentional misconduct other than a $1 million operating lease adjustment noted in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 which was a refinement of an error previously corrected and reported in fiscal 2011.AustraliaIn the course of the Australia investigation initiated in fiscal 2012, accounting errors and irregularities have been identified. As a result, certain personnel in Australia have been reprimanded, suspended, terminated and or resigned. Based upon the information developed to date, and the Companys assessment of the same, the Company has identified and recorded during fiscal 2012, $23 million of adjustments reducing income from continuing operations before taxes relating to its operations in Australia. Such adjustments have been categorized as either intentional accounting irregularities (intentional irregularities) or other accounting errors (Other Errors). Other accounting errors include both unintentional errors and errors for which the categorization is unclear. The categorizations were provided to the Company through the independent investigation. The impact of the adjustments on income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes is attributable to the following prior fiscal years:33 Increase/(Decrease)(Amounts in millions) FY08 &Prior (unaudited) FY09 (unaudited) FY10 FY11 TotalIntentional irregularities $10 $(7) $(4) $1 $Other Errors (7) (16) 3 (3) (23) $3 $(23) $(1) $(2) $(23)Americas OutsourcingIn the course of the independent investigation of Americas Outsourcing accounting practices, accounting conventions used by Americas Outsourcing relating to intraperiod cost allocations were determined to be unintentional accounting errors. The errors did not have an impact on a fiscal year basis. The Company also determined that other operating units employed similar practices and made necessary corrections. The Company has determined that the impact of these corrections was not material on any fiscal year.In addition to the adjustments discussed above, a $1 million out of period adjustment related to an understatement of a fiscal 2011 management incentive compensation expense disclosed in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 has been determined by the Company to be a $3 million out of period adjustment as a result of the investigation. This item included multiple components, a portion of which the Company previously considered not to be related to out of period errors. Based on the results of the independent investigation, the Company now attributes these adjustments to Other Errors, which include both unintentional errors and errors for which the categorization is unclear. NHSIn fiscal 2012, $25 million of out of period adjustments reducing income from continuing operations related to the Companys NHS contract were identified and recorded. During the course of the investigation in fiscal 2012 of the percentage of completion accounting method used on the Companys NHS contract, certain accounting errors were identified related to costs incurred under the contract, which resulted in errors in the recognition of income from continuing operations that would have reduced by approximately $24 million the $1.5 billion write off recorded by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Although the Company has concluded that these errors do not appear to have any impact on amounts charged to the NHS, the errors have impacted the operating income recognized on the NHS contract. The exclusion of certain costs incurred under the contract caused the estimated margin at completion, which determines the operating income that is booked when revenue milestones are achieved, to be overstated. Although the Company has concluded that there is no cumulative impact as a result of the $1.5 billion charge relating to the NHS contract recorded as of December 30, 2011, operating income from fiscal year 2007 through and including fiscal 2011 has been overstated by a total of approximately $24 million and, therefore, the charge taken by the Company as of December 30, 2011 was overstated by approximately the same amount. Certain additional items have been identified but not yet recorded related to the NHS contract that could have an effect on the amount and the allocation of the out of period adjustments for fiscal 2012 and prior fiscal years. Management does not believe that the effect of these additional items is material to the Companys financial statements. However, the investigation into these additional items is ongoing, and the amount could change and the allocation across years is likely to change.Certain CSC finance employees based in the United Kingdom were aware prior to fiscal 2012 of the aforementioned errors, but those employees failed to appropriately correct the errors. Therefore, the Company has classified these errors as intentional. Such categorization was provided to the Company through the independent investigation. As a result, certain personnel have been suspended and additional disciplinary actions are being considered.In addition to the NHS accounting errors discussed above, the Company identified and recorded a $1 million adjustment in fiscal 2012 to write off contract acquisition costs that were inappropriately capitalized in fiscal year 2008. The Company has classified this error as unintentional.The investigation also identified a transaction which was treated as a cost item but should have been treated as a reduction in revenue. This has resulted in an overstatement of revenue and an overstatement of operating costs from 34fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2012 of $6 million. The impact on income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes of the $25 million of out of period adjustments identified in fiscal 2012 related to the Companys NHS contract is attributable to the following prior fiscal years:(Amounts in millions) Increase/(Decrease)Fiscal 2011 $(8)Fiscal 2010 (4)Fiscal 2009 (unaudited) (3)Prior fiscal years (unaudited) (10)Fiscal 2012 Financial Impact SummaryAs noted above, during fiscal 2012, the Company recorded various pre tax adjustments reducing income from continuing operations before taxes by $79 million ($63 million, net of tax), that should have been recorded in prior fiscal years. The out of period adjustments recorded in fiscal 2012 were comprised principally of $13 million of charges in the Nordic region, $23 million of charges in the Companys operations in Australia, $25 million of charges originating from the NHS contract in the Companys BSS segment and $16 million in the NPS segment. The NPS adjustments were identified by the Company and were primarily related to percentage of completion accounting adjustments.Certain additional items have been identified but not yet recorded related to the NHS contract that could have an effect on the amount and the allocation of the out of period adjustments for fiscal 2012 and prior years. Management does not believe that the effect of these additional items is material to the Companys financial statements. However, the investigation into these additional items is ongoing, and the amount could change and the allocation across years is likely to change.The following table summarizes the cumulative effect on net income (loss) attributable to CSC common shareholders of the consolidated out of period adjustments recorded during fiscal 2012.

Consequently, the cumulative effect of these adjustments was recorded during fiscal 2012.Effect of Adjustments on Prior Year Financial StatementsAs noted above, during fiscal 2011, the Company recorded $52 million of pre tax adjustments that should have been recorded in prior fiscal years. The total out of period adjustments recorded in fiscal 2011 were comprised of $92 million of charges reducing income from continuing operations before taxes originating out of the Companys MSS operations in the Nordic region, and $40 million of adjustments increasing income from continuing operations before taxes, with $36 million of the $40 million within MSS. Based upon the Companys investigation, review of the underlying documentation for certain transactions and balances, review of contract documentation and discussions with Nordic personnel, the Company attributes the majority of the out of period adjustments identified and recorded in the Nordic region in fiscal 2011 to accounting irregularities arising from suspected intentional misconduct by certain former employees in our Danish subsidiaries. These accounting irregularities included the inappropriate capitalization of operating costs, the misapplication of US GAAP and miscellaneous errors. The following table summarizes the cumulative effect on fiscal 2011 of the net income attributable to CSC common shareholders of the consolidated out of period adjustments recorded during fiscal 2011 and 2012.

Consequently, the cumulative effect of these adjustments was recorded during fiscal 2011. Goodwill Impairment The Company initiated its annual goodwill impairment analysis at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2012 and concluded that fair value was below carrying value for three reporting units: Managed Services Sector (MSS), Global Business Solutions (BSS GBS) and the Healthcare Group (BSS Health). Furthermore, at the end of the second quarter, 38sufficient indicators existed to require performance of an additional, interim goodwill impairment analysis, and the BSS GBS reporting unit again had a fair value that was below carrying value. Management believed that the decline in the estimated fair values of these reporting units was a result of several factors, including uncertainty about the Companys overall value as reflected in CSCs stock price decline over the first half of fiscal 2012, overall decline in the broader stock market as indicated by reduced performance metric multiples at comparable public companies, and decline in forecasted operating performance of these reporting units. The September 30, 2011 interim goodwill testing also indicated that the fair values of two reporting units BSS Health and BSS iSOFT passed step one but were not considered to be substantially in excess of carrying values. BSS Health had a fair value estimated to be approximately 6% in excess of its carrying value. For BSS iSOFT, which was acquired during the second quarter and was a new reporting unit, fair value approximated carrying value due to the proximity of its acquisition to the second quarter interim goodwill impairment test. For the remaining reporting units with goodwill, fair values substantially exceeded carrying values. During the process of conducting the second steps of the annual and the interim goodwill impairment tests, the Company identified significant unrecognized intangible assets (primarily customer relationship and technology assets) which, along with fair value changes to the carrying values of other assets and liabilities as well as the lower reporting unit fair values calculated in step one, resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of goodwill for the MSS, BSS GBS and BSS Health reporting units. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $2,685 million of which $2,074 million related to the MSS reporting unit, $453 million related to the BSS GBS reporting unit, and $158 million related to the BSS Health reporting unit. By the end of the second quarter, the Company was not able to complete all the analyses associated with the annual and the interim impairment goodwill impairment tests primarily because of the complexity and the effort required to fair value all the assets and liabilities of the three reporting units which are spread across the globe; consequently, the amount of goodwill impairment recorded at the end of the second quarter represented managements best estimate.During the third quarter, the Company completed all analyses related to the annual and interim goodwill impairment tests, and identified adjustments that reduced the impairment loss recorded in the second quarter by $3 million. The entire adjustment was associated with the BSS Health reporting unit, and resulted from finalizing tax estimates and customer/technology asset fair values. Thus, the total second quarter goodwill impairment loss was adjusted to $2,682 million.At the end of the third quarter, the Company assessed whether there were any events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company concluded that such indicators were present for two of its reporting units, BSS Health and BSS iSOFT. With respect to BSS Health, the loss of a significant customer, the failure to win some major bids for new business, and reduction in forecasted earnings was considered a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test. For BSS iSOFT, the recent developments on the NHS contract were considered a triggering event (see Note 16). There were no triggering events for the remaining reporting units with goodwill.In conducting the first step of the third quarter interim goodwill impairment test for the BSS Health reporting unit, the factors stated above resulted in a reassessment of forecasted cash flow assumptions under an income approach, as well as a revised valuation using a market multiples fair value approach, which led the weighted average fair value of the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value, thus triggering the need to proceed to step two. For the BSS iSOFT reporting unit however, the weighted average fair value was estimated to be greater than its carrying value due to better than forecast performance on the core iSOFT business (not related to the NHS contract). During the process of conducting the second step of the third quarter interim goodwill impairment test for BSS Health, the Company estimated the fair value of its tangible assets and identified unrecognized intangible assets, primarily customer relationship and technology assets, and recorded an impairment charge of $63 million. After recording the third quarter charge of $63 million, the BSS Health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as of December 30, 2011 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At the end of the fourth quarter, the Company assessed if there were events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below their carrying amounts. There were no such indicators for any of the reporting units with goodwill and therefore an interim goodwill test was not required to be performed. 39Any further significant declines in CSCs stock price or any further significant adverse changes in the business climate or operating results could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis of goodwill in future periods prior to the next annual test.Cost of Services Specified Contract ChargeAs more fully discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, CSC and NHS are parties to a 2.9 billion (approximately $5.4 billion at originally announced exchange rates) contract under which the Company is developing and deploying an integrated electronic patient records system. The contract has been accounted for using the percentage of completion method based on managements best estimates of total contract revenue and costs. As described more fully below, the Company recorded a charge of $1,485 million in the fiscal 2012 third quarter, with $204 million recorded as a reduction of revenue, in connection with the Companys ongoing negotiations with the NHS.On February 4, 2011, NHS formally notified the Company that it believed the Companys failure to achieve a key milestone constituted a breach of contract and NHS was considering its position on termination of all or parts of the contract; however, NHS subsequently clarified that its notice was not intended to suggest that termination is the only option which it was considering and, in fact, NHS was considering the full range of options it believed were available to NHS. Notwithstanding this dispute, both NHS and the Company continued discussions leading to agreement on the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), the terms of which would ultimately be reflected in a contract amendment. Negotiation of the terms of the MOU were substantially completed in May 2011. Subsequent government reviews of the MOU occurred. In November 2011, the Company, the NHS and Cabinet officials resumed discussions on the MOU and the way forward, which included discussions regarding a proposed contract amendment with different scope modifications and contract value reductions than those contemplated by the MOU. In late December 2011, CSC was informed that neither the MOU nor the contract amendment then under discussion would be approved by the government. Notwithstanding the failure to reach agreement, CSC and the NHS continued discussions in 2012 regarding proposals advanced by both parties reflecting scope modifications and contract value reductions that differed materially from those contemplated by the MOU. As a result of these discussions, CSC and the NHS entered into a non binding letter of intent on March 2, 2012. Under the letter of intent, the NHS and CSC have agreed to a set of high level principles, which are intended to be reflected in a binding interim agreement to be entered into by the parties. The non binding letter of intent contemplates that under the interim agreement, NHS will provide a commitment of a certain number of trusts, some to be named in the interim agreement and the remainder within six months, to receive the Lorenzo software product, which has been redefined into deployment units categorized as base product and additional product for pricing purposes. In addition to the amounts committed by NHS for the base product, additional amounts will be available from centrally available funds for additional products, supplemental trust activity and local configuration. The letter of intent also contemplates that the interim agreement will provide for a structured set of payments following certain product deliveries, as well as additional payments to CSC, which would cover, among other items, various deployments for the named trusts and payments for work already performed. Any payments would be made only if the binding interim agreement is entered into by the parties. The letter of intent provides that the interim agreement will contain an optional purchase arrangement for those additional trusts (other than the committed named trusts) that choose to take a deployment of Lorenzo. Pricing will be the same as that applicable to the committed named trusts. The letter of intent provides for an interim Lorenzo related standstill arrangement and contemplates that a mutual release of all accrued claims with respect to the Lorenzo deployments will be included as part of the interim agreement. The interim agreement, if agreed, will form the basis of an amendment and restatement of the existing NHS contract to be negotiated by the parties. Entry into the interim agreement, and ultimately the amendment, will require U.K. government approvals. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained. While the parties intended to conclude a binding interim agreement by March 30, 2012, as previously disclosed, no agreement has yet been reached. The parties have continued discussions concerning the interim agreement. The previously disclosed Lorenzo related standstill agreement remains in effect through June 1, 2012.There can be no assurance that CSC and NHS will enter into the interim agreement or any amendment to the existing agreement or if the parties do not enter into the interim agreement or an amendment by June 1, 2012 that the Lorenzo 40related standstill arrangement will be extended. Likewise, there can be no assurance that if the interim agreement or any amendment are negotiated and entered into, that such documents as finally negotiated will be on terms favorable to CSC or as provided in the letter of intent. The contract has been accounted for using the percentage of completion method based on managements best estimates of total contract revenue and costs. While software development and deployment activities continue in cooperation with the NHS, because of the December 2011 communication rejecting the MOU referred to above, the proposals to significantly reduce the scope and value of the Lorenzo deployments, and the uncertainty over the results of these negotiations, CSC has revised its estimate of revenues and costs at completion under the percentage of completion method to include only those revenues reasonably assured of collection. As a result of this change in estimate, the Company recorded a $1,485 million contract charge as of December 30, 2011, including a $204 million reduction of revenue. This charge included the write off of its work in process balance of $1,263 million, billed and unbilled receivables of $204 million and net other assets and liabilities of $18 million, resulting in no material remaining net assets. While the contract is in a cumulative loss position as of December 30, 2011, an additional forward loss is not evident and has not been accrued, but further losses could be incurred by CSC depending on the outcome of negotiations, the terms of any potential agreement, or if no agreement is concluded. The Company is unable to estimate the amount of such additional costs; however, such costs could be material. In addition, depending on the outcome of the negotiations, it is also reasonably possible that an agreement amending the terms of the NHS contract, if concluded, could result in a payment for the recovery of a portion of the amounts that have been written off as of March 30, 2012 and therefore generate a gain in the near term. However, there can be no assurance that an agreement with NHS will be concluded, that the terms of any such agreement would be favorable to CSC or as provided in the letter of intent, that any gain will be generated in the event such an agreement is concluded or that any recovery will occur.Costs of Services Settlement Charge During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Government in its contract claims asserted under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA). Under the terms of the settlement, the Company received $277 million in cash and a five year extension (four base years plus one option year) with an estimated total contract value of $1 billion to continue to support and expand the capabilities of the systems covered by the original contract scheduled to expire in December 2011. In December 2011, the Company signed the contract modification based on the terms described above. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded a pre tax charge of $269 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 to write down its claim related assets (claim related unbilled receivables of $379 million and deferred costs of $227 million) to reflect the cash received of $277 million, the estimated fair value of the contract extension of $45 million, and previously unapplied payments of $15 million. Of the pre tax charge of $269 million, $42 million was recorded as a reduction of revenue and $227 million as a separately itemized charge to cost of services. The fair value of the contract extension was recorded as a contract asset and will be amortized as a reduction of revenue over the four year fixed contract term in proportion to the expected revenues or a straight line basis, whichever is greater. The contract extension contained a Requirements portion and an Indefinite Quantity portion (and is not subject to any minimum values). See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.Restructuring CostsIn March 2012, the Company initiated a series of restructuring actions primarily to address excess capacity issues across Europe and to align its workforce with current business needs. In addition to reducing headcount, these actions contemplate increased use of lower cost off shore resources and optimal utilization of facilities, which includes vacating and consolidating office space. Actions under these plans commenced in March 2012 and are expected to be carried out through fiscal 2013. The restructuring actions envision reduction in the Companys workforce by approximately 1,900 employees, approximately 1,550 of which are in Europe, primarily in the U.K. and in the Nordic region, 200 in the United States and the remaining spread across Latin America, Asia and Australia.A total of $140 million of restructuring costs were accrued in March 2012, which included $21 million of pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations, and which will be paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions. Of the total restructuring costs of $140 million, $108 million relates to MSS, $31 million to BSS, and $1 million to NPS. Excluding the pension liability, the remaining $119 million of restructuring liability as of March 30, 2012, includes $112 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2013 and $7 million thereafter. The Company expects to incur additional restructuring costs in fiscal 2013 of approximately $59 million.41Costs of Services Fiscal 2012Costs of services (COS), excluding the specified contract charge, the settlement charge, and the restructuring charges, as a percentage of revenue increased to 84.4% for fiscal 2012 from 80.6% for fiscal 2011. Both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 COS were adversely impacted by out of period adjustments recorded during these years but which were related to prior years. The amounts recorded in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 were $25 million and $15 million, respectively, in MSS and $15 million and $4 million, respectively, in BSS. The fiscal 2012 increase in the COS ratio was primarily driven by adverse results in the MSS and the BSS segments. The MSS COS ratio was impacted by adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of $142 million of which $48 million was recorded as a reduction of revenue, impairment of tangible and intangible assets of $144 million associated primarily with service delivery issues on certain outsourcing contracts, and start up issues on certain outsourcing contracts, including transition cost overruns of $34 million. Of these specific charges of $320 million, $171 million were recorded in the fourth quarter.BSS COS ratio was adversely impacted primarily by the NHS contract and the financial services business. Subsequent to the $1.5 billion NHS adjustment recorded in the third quarter and pending the finalization of a contract amendment, the Company recorded $29 million of operating losses in the fourth quarter (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, a year over year shift in BSS financial services revenue mix, caused by a decline in the proportion of the higher margin license revenue, adversely impacted the BSS COS ratio. BSS COS ratio was impacted by adverse adjustments of $17 million on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of which $6 million was recorded as reduction in revenue. The NPS COS ratio increased primarily as a result of recording $72 million of net adverse adjustments on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method. The net adjustments included adverse adjustments of $130 million, of which $40 million reduced revenue, and favorable adjustments of $58 million of which $10 million increased revenue. Favorable adjustments included a $48 million COS benefit on a contract that had a similar adjustment in fiscal 2011. Of the total $72 million net adverse adjustments, $44 million was recorded in the fourth quarter.Fiscal 2011Costs of services as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2011 increased to 80.6% from 79.2% for fiscal 2010, primarily driven by adverse changes in MSS EMEA and Americas operations as well as from a significant adjustment on the NHS contract within the BSS segment. As discussed above, out of period adjustments recorded in MSS increased fiscal 2011 COS by $19 million and understated the reported fiscal 2010 COS by $33 million. Additionally in the Nordics region, operational issues including excess staffing capacity, performance issues, and lower revenue also increased the COS ratio in fiscal 2011. The MSS fiscal 2011 COS ratio was further adversely impacted by higher start up and transition expenses on several contracts and a strengthening Indian rupee during fiscal 2011 which increased costs on U.S. dollar denominated contracts.Selling, General and AdministrativeFiscal 2012Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, excluding the restructuring charges, as a percentage of revenue increased to 7.2% for fiscal 2012 from 6.0% for fiscal 2011. The fiscal 2012 increase was primarily driven by an increase in corporate general & administrative (G&A) costs and a higher BSS ratio. The corporate G&A costs increased year over year primarily due to higher legal and other fees of $67 million incurred mainly related to the ongoing SEC and Audit Committee investigations into the matters surrounding the out of period adjustments discussed previously. The Company will continue to incur such fees as these investigations are ongoing. In addition, the Company expects to incur additional legal and other professional fees in connection with various putative class action lawsuits that have been filed in federal court (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Corporate G&A costs were higher also due to costs associated with the former CEOs severance of $7 million. These cost increases were partially offset by lower bonuses of $10 million and reduced stock compensation expense of $11 million, 42principally due to reduction in the probable outcome of performance based restricted stock units for certain executives. The BSS ratio increased primarily due to iSOFT. iSOFTs SG&A ratio was adversely impacted by $23 million of transaction and transition costs incurred related to its acquisition. Fiscal 2011Selling, general and administrative expense improved 0.2% points to 6% as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. This improvement was driven by reductions in Corporate G&A costs through lower legal and professional fees, and incentive compensation while the business segments maintained consistent ratios with fiscal 2010.Depreciation and AmortizationFiscal 2012Depreciation and amortization (D&A) as a percentage of revenue increased to 7.3% for fiscal 2012 from 6.7% for fiscal 2011. The increase in the fiscal 2012 ratio was driven by all three segments. The BSS ratio increased due to higher amortization expense associated with the acquired iSOFT intangible and tangible assets. The higher MSS ratio is due to higher capital expenditure on outsourcing contracts. The higher NPS ratio is due to higher fixed asset purchases on certain of its contracts, as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets from fiscal 2012 and 2011 acquisitions.Fiscal 2011D&A decreased 0.2% points to 6.7% of revenue in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Lower D&A expense in both the MSS & BSS segments were the contributors to this performance reflecting the reducing levels of capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 and 2009 in line with the Companys ongoing program.Interest Expense and Interest Income Fiscal 2012Interest expense of $176 million in fiscal 2012 increased $8 million compared to fiscal 2011 due to an increase in capital leases in MSS. Interest income increased $1 million to $38 million in fiscal 2012. Higher interest income was primarily due to higher interest earned on cash balances in India during the first two quarters of fiscal 2012.Fiscal 2011Interest expense of $168 million in fiscal 2011 decreased $84 million compared to fiscal 2010. The lower interest expense is a result of lower debt levels during fiscal 2011 primarily due to the repayment of the 7.375% $500 million term note in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, and repayment of the $1.5 billion credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. The decrease in interest expense due to repayment of term notes and credit facility was slightly offset by higher interest on increased capital lease activity and interest on borrowings for assets acquired under long term financing primarily in the MSS segment.Interest income increased $10 million to $37 million in fiscal 2011 due to the combination of increase in interest rates and in foreign cash balances, primarily in India, Australia and Asia.43Other (Income) Expense, NetThe components of other (income) expense, net for fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011, and fiscal 2010 are: Twelve Months Ended(Amounts in millions) March 30, 2012 April 1, 2011 April 2, 2010Foreign currency loss (gain) $4 $(2) $4Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates (10) (11) (14)Other gains (7) (10)Total $(6) $(20) $(20)The Company reported other income of $6 million for fiscal 2012 compared to $20 million in fiscal 2011. Foreign currency loss of $4 million for fiscal 2012 was due to the movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee, which adversely impacted the Companys foreign currency options. Reduction in other gains is due to fiscal 2011 gains on sale of an investment and non controlling interest in a business, both of which did not recur in fiscal 2012. There was no change in total other (income) expense from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010; however, there was a slightly different mix. Foreign currency net gains of $2 million were the result of the effect of currency rate movement primarily between the U.S. dollar and Indian rupee, which favorably impacted the Companys hedging program. Reduction of equity earnings reflects the disposal of a minority equity shareholding during the year, while the other gains reflect a $3 million gain from the disposal of the minority equity investment, and a gain of $4 million from other minority investments.The Company reported other income of $20 million for fiscal 2010 compared with $8 million of other expense in fiscal 2009. Other (gains) losses for fiscal 2010 primarily includes a gain of $6 million related to sale of the former corporate headquarters facility in El Segundo, California, a gain of $6 million from a positive workers compensation claim experience on a business divested in fiscal 2005, and a $3 million loss related to a building for sale in Europe. TaxesThe Companys effective tax rate (ETR) on (loss) income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was (2.8)%, 25.1%, and 18.8%, respectively. As a global enterprise, our ETR is affected by many factors, including our global mix of earnings, the extent to which those global earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, legislation, acquisitions, dispositions, and tax characteristics of our income. Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The following are the major events that had a significant impact on the ETR in fiscal years ended 2012, 2011, and 2010.In fiscal 2012, the ETR was primarily driven by:The Company recorded a $1,485 million charge related to the NHS contract. Following the write down, a full valuation allowance was established against the net operating losses in the U.K., which resulted in the Company not recording a tax benefit for the NHS charges. This charge and subsequent valuation allowance had a significant impact on the tax expense and ETR of $508 million and 12%, respectively.The Company recorded a $2,745 million goodwill impairment charge which was mostly not deductible for tax purposes. This charge resulted in an impact to the tax expense and ETR of $838 million and 19%, respectively.The Company settled various tax examinations and recognized income tax benefits related to audit settlements (and the expiration of statutes of limitations on audits) of approximately $111 million, which had a favorable impact on the ETR for the fiscal year of 3%.The Company elected to change the tax status of one of its foreign subsidiaries. This change in tax status resulted in a deemed liquidation for U.S. tax purposes and triggered various deductions which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $114 million and had a favorable impact on the ETR for the fiscal year of 3%.In fiscal 2011, the Company settled a portion of its U.S. federal income tax audit for the fiscal years 2005 through 2007 related specifically to research and development (R&D) credits. This favorable settlement of $68 million had a 7% impact 44on the ETR for the fiscal year ended 2011.In fiscal 2010, the Company reversed a valuation allowance of $53 million associated with branch net operating loss carryforwards and the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position of $18 million for foreign tax credits as a result of an audit settlement. These items had a 7% impact on the ETR for the fiscal year.As of March 30, 2012, in accordance with ASC 740 10, the Companys liability for uncertain tax positions was $257 million, including interest of $31 million, penalties of $15 million, and net of tax attributes of $76 million. During the year ended March 30, 2012, the Company had a net reduction of interest of $56 million ($36 million net of tax) and had a net reduction of penalties of $14 million. The net reduction of interest and penalties includes impacts of normal operations, audit settlements, and acquisitions.A reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the ETR, as well as other information about our income tax provision, is provided in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The India Finance Bill of 2012 (the Indian Finance Bill) has been approved by both houses of the Indian Parliament and, if signed into law, could have an adverse material impact on the Companys tax liabilities. The provisions of the Indian Finance Bill provide for the taxation of indirect foreign investment in India, and would likely be applied retroactively for a period of years prior to the date of enactment subject to the current statute of limitations for tax assessments in India, which is 6 years. This Indian Finance Bill overrides the recent Vodafone ruling by the Supreme Court of India which held that the Indian Tax Authorities cannot assess capital gains taxes on the sale of shares of non Indian companies that indirectly own shares in an Indian company. The retroactive nature of these changes in law has been strongly criticized. We expect that the Indian Finance Bill will be challenged in the Indian courts. However, there is no assurance that such a challenge will be successful.CSC has engaged in transactions that could be subject to retroactive treatment under the Indian Finance Bill, including the purchase of shares of foreign companies that indirectly own shares of an Indian company and internal reorganizations. The Indian tax authorities may seek to apply the provisions of the Indian Finance Bill to these prior transactions and seek to tax CSC directly or as a withholding agent or representative assessee of the sellers involved in prior acquisitions. The Company is in the process of determining the amount of the potential exposure, but believes that this amount could be material. It is the intention of the Company to vigorously assert its defenses against any claims raised by the Indian Tax Authorities. Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Share Base Earnings (loss) per share (EPS), on a diluted basis, decreased $32.10 to $(27.37) in fiscal 2012. This decrease in EPS was due to net loss attributable to CSC common shareholders in fiscal 2012. The net loss attributable to CSC common shareholders was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $2,745 million recorded during the second and third quarters (see Note 9), the contract charge associated with the U.K. NHS contract of $1,485 million recorded during the third quarter (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), the settlement charge of $269 million that resulted from the settlement of claims with the U.S. Federal Government during the second quarter (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and restructuring costs of $140 million recorded during the fourth quarter (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Delivery issues on certain MSS and NPS contracts resulted in recording forward losses on contracts accounted under the percentage of completion method, and asset impairments which also adversely impacted the EPS. Diluted EPS for fiscal 2011 decreased $0.55 to $4.73 from $5.28 in fiscal 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the decrease in net income attributable to CSC common shareholders of 9.4% for fiscal 2011. Net income attributable to CSC common shareholders decreased $77 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, due to a combination of lower pre tax earnings and higher taxes in fiscal 2011. The decrease in EPS was also due to an increase in the weighted average common shares and common stock equivalents during the fiscal year due to the year over year appreciation in the Companys stock price. 45Financial ConditionCash FlowsAmounts in millions Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Fiscal 2010Net cash from operations $1,176 $1,564 $1,643Net cash used in investing (1,308) (892) (790)Net cash used in from financing (581) (1,676) (487)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (31) 57 121Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (744) (947) 487Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 1,837 2,784 2,297Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $1,093 $1,837 $2,784The Companys cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by $744 million during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. Net cash from operations decreased $388 million primarily driven by net cash outflows on the NHS contract. Cash used in investing activities increased $416 million compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to acquisition of businesses and lower cash received from business dispositions and sale of assets. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to repayment of $1.5 billion related to the old credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011.Operating Cash FlowFor fiscal 2012, net cash from operating activities of $1,176 million decreased $388 million as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease is primarily due to higher payroll and related costs primarily due to the fiscal 2012 acquisitions, repayment of NHS advance contract payments (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by receipt of cash upon settlement of claims with the U.S. government (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and reduced cash taxes. In fiscal 2011, net cash from operating activities of $1,564 million decreased $79 million as compared to fiscal 2010. The decrease is primarily due to reduced cash flows from advance contract payments of approximately $370 million, mainly from NHS, offset by higher collections from customers of approximately $100 million, reduced interest and tax payments of $97 million and $126 million, respectively. The reduced NHS advance contract payments are a result of delays in achieving certain milestones for Lorenzo Regional Care, as well as ongoing contract modification negotiations. The higher collections and reduced vendor payments are due to timing. The reduction in cash taxes paid is primarily due to additional pension contributions made in March 2010, which resulted in the Company generating a significant overpayment on its fiscal 2010 tax return which reduced cash tax payments made during fiscal 2011. Additionally, the Company made a cash payment to settle a tax audit with the German tax authorities during fiscal 2010, which did not recur in fiscal 2011.Investing Cash Flow Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2012 of $1.3 billion increased $416 million compared to fiscal 2011. The increase is primarily due to an increase in payments for business acquisitions of $216 million, and higher expenditures on software of $63 million. These increases were partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment of $94 million, lower proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $94 million, and lower proceeds from two divestitures of $117 million in fiscal 2011, which did not recur in fiscal 2012.In fiscal 2011, investing cash outflows increased $102 million compared to fiscal 2010. The increase is primarily due to increase in payments for business acquisitions of $153 million, higher purchases of property and equipment and corporate assets of $85 million, partially offset by greater proceeds from two divestitures of $105 million and lower cash flow associated with outsourcing contracts of $38 million. Financing Cash Flow Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 was $581 million, a decrease of $1,095 million from fiscal 2011. This decrease is primarily due to repayment of $1.5 billion related to the old credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, partially offset by higher repayments on capital leases and other long term debt. 46In fiscal 2011, net cash used in financing activities was $1,676 million, an increase of $1,189 million from fiscal 2010. This increase is primarily due to repayment of a $1.5 billion credit facility in the third quarter, repurchase of $65 million of the Companys outstanding common stock in the fourth quarter under the previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, and payment of cash dividends of $77 million.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe balance of cash and cash equivalents was $1,093 million at March 30, 2012 and $1,837 million at April 1, 2011, and total equity decreased $4,726 million to $2,834 million during fiscal 2012. Of the total amount of cash and cash equivalents of $1,093 million at March 30, 2012, $788 million was held outside of the U.S. At the end of fiscal 2012, CSCs ratio of debt to total capitalization was 49.2%, an increase from 25.4% at the end of fiscal 2011, and from 36.5% at the end of fiscal 2010. The increase in the debt ratio for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of a decrease in total equity associated with the fiscal 2012 net loss, driven by the goodwill impairment, the specified contract charges, and other charges and results discussed above.The following table summarizes the Companys debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year end 2012 and 2011:Amount in millions March 30, 2012 April 1, 2011Debt $2,740 $2,579Equity 2,834 7,560Total capitalization $5,574 $10,139Debt to total capitalization 49.2% 25.4%At March 30, 2012, the Company had $43 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $1,211 million of current maturities and $1,486 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of March 30, 2012.At April 1, 2011, the Company had $29 million of short term borrowings under uncommitted lines of credit with foreign banks, $141 million of current maturities and $2,409 million of long term debt. The Company had no outstanding commercial paper as of April 1, 2011.On March 18, 2011, the Company entered into a new committed line of credit providing $1.5 billion of long term commercial paper backup which replaced the existing $1.5 billion line of credit that would have expired on July 12, 2012. The new line of credit expires on March 18, 2015. This line requires the Company to: (1) maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization adjusted for other non cash charges as defined by the credit agreement (EBITDA), to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to be less than 3.00 to 1.00; and (2) not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date, to exceed 3.00 to 1.00. The Company is in full compliance with these requirements.On December 13, 2010, CSCs Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $1.0 billion in share repurchases of the Companys outstanding common stock (2011 Repurchase Program). In fiscal 2011, the Company repurchased 1.4 million shares in the open market for approximately $65 million in accordance with SEC rule 10 b18. The timing, volume, and nature of future share repurchases will be at the discretion of management, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. CSCs Board has not established an end date for the 2011 Repurchase Program. The company did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2012.In fiscal 2012, the Company continued paying quarterly cash dividends to its common stockholders. During the year, cash dividends of $0.80 per share or approximately $124 million were paid out. The Company has sufficient liquidity and expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends although such payments are subject to continued approval by the Board of Directors. The Companys total liquidity is comprised of cash and cash equivalents plus any borrowing available under its credit 47facility. As of March 30, 2012, the Companys total liquidity was approximately $2.6 billion, consisting of $1.1 billion of cash and the full $1.5 billion available under the 2015 credit facility. The Company may fund its short term debt obligations through a combination of internally available cash balances, use of its existing $1.5 billion credit facility and or new borrowings.Continued uncertainty in the global economic conditions may affect the Companys business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize, defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect operating cash flow.Liquidity RiskThe cash held by the Company outside the U.S. is not presently available to fund U.S. operations or obligations without paying taxes upon its repatriation. It is managements intent to use the foreign cash balances to fund non U.S. acquisitions, capital needs and other cash requirements. The recent acquisitions of iSOFT and AppLabs during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were made with the use of non U.S. cash. Continued uncertainty in the global economic conditions may affect the Companys business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize, defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect operating cash flow.The Companys exposure to operational liquidity risk is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash during the initial phases of the contracts. The recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the Companys performance as well as customer acceptance. The Companys ability to access the commercial paper and debt markets is dependent on liquidity in the credit markets as well as the Companys financial position. On March 18, 2011, the Company entered into a committed line of credit providing $1.5 billion of long term commercial paper backup. This line of credit expires on March 18, 2015. Beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company was able to borrow against commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs. As of March 30, 2012, there are no borrowings outstanding against commercial paper. Our credit ratings and outlooks are summarized below. On May 17, 2012, Moodys lowered our long term credit rating from Baa1 with a negative watch to Baa2 with a stable outlook. Moodys confirmed its short term rating at Prime 2. In December 2011, S&P lowered our rating from A to BBB+ with a negative credit watch. On May 22, 2012, S&P and Fitch lowered our credit rating to BBB with a negative outlook. These changes had no material impact on our current borrowing costs, and we believe they will not have a material impact on our ability to raise further debt financing in the future although the costs of such borrowing would increase. The ratings and outlooks issued by Moodys, S&P and Fitch appear in the table below:Rating AgencyRatingOutlookFitchBBBNegativeMoodysBaa2StableS&PBBBNegativeCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, our financial position, resolution of the issues relating to the NHS contract and changes in our business strategy. If further changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. In the opinion of management, CSC will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities and current cash balances. If these resources need to be augmented, major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms in the future.48Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the expiration of the Companys financial guarantees outstanding as of March 30, 2012:(Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2013 Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2015 & thereafter TotalPerformance guarantees: Surety bonds $29 $ $ $29 Letters of credit 176 2 16 194Standby letters of credit 63 2 14 79Foreign subsidiary guarantees 795 795Total $1,063 $4 $30 $1,097For additional information on off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

The Company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years. If the Company does not meet the specified service minimums, the Company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or the entire shortfall. During fiscal 2013, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $254 million to pension and $10 million to postretirement benefit plans. The Company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal 2013 because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets, which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations. During fiscal 2012, pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to $262 million, an increase of $23 million from $239 million in fiscal 2011. Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section later in this MD&A and to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. DividendsDuring fiscal 2012, quarterly dividends declared aggregated to $0.80 per share or $124 million. Of the total dividends declared, $93 million was paid in fiscal 2012 and the balance of $31 million was paid on April 16, 2012. On May 15, 2012, the Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.20 per share for the quarter ended March 30, 2012, payable on July 12, 2012 to the holders of record of the Companys common stock as of the close of business on June 14, 2012. 49CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues. Changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements. We have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting estimates relate to: revenue recognition, cost estimation and recoverability on long term, fixed price contracts; revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization; capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs; estimates used to determine deferred income taxes; assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill; assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities; and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Revenue recognition The majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates. Revenue from our fixed unit price contracts, time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time. However, for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting, which is approximately 7.8% percent of the Companys revenues, the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation. Under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other input or output based measures are achieved. Costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved. The method requires estimates of revenues, costs and profits over the entire term of the contract, including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance. Such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers, program managers and financial professionals. Key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates. Modifications to contract scope, schedule, and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery. If recovery is deemed probable, we may, as appropriate, either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance. We routinely negotiate such contract modifications. Many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers. The total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), third party evidence (TPE) or managements best estimate of selling price for the deliverables when VSOE or TPE are not available. Once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements, revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered. Estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume differences, changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception. 50Revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization If significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product, and VSOE is available to support accounting for the software as a separate unit of account, revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above. Thus, cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project, and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results. Capitalization of outsourcing contract costs Certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life. These costs consist of contract acquisition and transition/set up costs, costs associated with installation of systems and processes, and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of assets acquired (i.e., premiums). Finance staff, working with program management, review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of assets acquired from a customer in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs. We utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management, operations, procurement and finance areas, as well as third parties on occasion, to determine fair values of assets acquired. To assess recoverability, undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets, including the unamortized deferred cost balance. Such estimates require judgment and assumptions, which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel. Key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies. A significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations. Amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction of revenue.Capitalization of software development costs We capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software. Significant estimates and assumptions include: determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. For commercial software products, determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete. For internal use software, the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis. To assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs, we must estimate future revenue, costs and cash flows. Such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows, and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff. A significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations. Estimates used to determine income tax expenseWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We also must analyze income tax reserves, as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. The calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination.Assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill 51We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments in determination of acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition, and require judgment in ascertaining their fair values. Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations can be based on significant estimates provided by the Company, such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Additional information obtained during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the recorded values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired. Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual results versus estimates, could result in material impacts to earnings.Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350 (FAS No. 142) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and reductions in growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill. The goodwill impairment test involves a two step process. The first step is a comparison of each reporting units fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting units fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. In this step, the reporting units fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business acquisition. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference.The Company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a discount rate. Cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of economic and market conditions which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. The discount rate in turn is based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit, the weighted average cost of capital and its underlying forecast. The market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting units prior and expected operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit derived using the income approach is significantly different from the fair value estimate using the market approach, the Company reevaluates its assumptions used in the two models. The fair values determined by the market approach and income approach, as described above, are weighted to determine the fair value for each reporting unit. The weighted values assigned to each reporting unit are primarily driven by two factors: 1) the number of comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach, and 2) the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, the Company also compares the sum of the reporting units fair values to its market capitalization (per share stock price times shares outstanding) and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization). The Company evaluates the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions, the Company will reevaluate its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and or other assumptions. As a result, when CSCs stock price is low, this reevaluation can result in lower estimated fair values of the reporting units.52Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal growth rates, capital expenditures, as well as discount rates. Estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. In addition, judgments and assumptions are required for allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit. Although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations, such estimates are uncertain and can vary from actual results. Assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities We offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans. CSC utilizes actuarial methods required by ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans, respectively. The actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates. We consider current market conditions such as changes in interest rates, in determining discount rates. Changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns on pension and postretirement plan assets. The assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the asset mix of the plan and other factors. Please see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. The weighted average of the expected long term rate of return, for all pension plans, on plan assets utilized for the fiscal 2012 and 2011 pension plan valuations was 6.8% and 7.5%, respectively. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percentage increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased, respectively, the fiscal 2012 net periodic pension cost by approximately $20 million. An assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension and postretirement plan actuarial valuation. The discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality, fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year. The weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal 2012 net periodic pension cost was 5.5% compared to 5.8% used for fiscal 2011. Holding all other assumptions constant, a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the fiscal 2012 net periodic pension cost by approximately $13 million, or increased it by approximately $14 million, respectively. Some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts.The accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year. Such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized into earnings over time. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, the actual return on assets exceeded the expected return on assets, producing an actuarial gain. However, offsetting this actuarial gain was an actuarial loss increasing the projected benefit obligation of the Companys pension plans primarily due to the decline in discount rates. As a result, pension assets as a percentage of projected benefit obligations decreased during the fiscal year. Assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation We are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits, insurance, tax and other issues arising in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on managements view of the expected outcome. CSC consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. If the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. Significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results. 53Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rates The Company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations, short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments. For the year ended March 30, 2012, a hypothetical 10% movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial conditions. Foreign CurrencyAs a large global organization the Company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. During the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. Potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process. The Company generally manages these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenue is received, and any related short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency. Thus, by generally matching revenues, costs and borrowings to the same currency, the Company is able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings. However, as the Company has increased its use of offshore support in recent years, it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations. The Company has policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. For accounting purposes, these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and thus all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other (income) expense. The Company also uses foreign currency options to manage its exposure to economic risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations. These financial instruments are generally short term in nature with typical maturities of less than one year. They are used to offset existing foreign currency positions or as economic hedges and not for speculative or trading purposes. During fiscal 2012, approximately 38% of the Companys revenue was generated outside of the United States. The Company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of movement in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings. For the year ended March 30, 2012, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would have impacted revenue by approximately 4% or $604 million, while a hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 4% or $604 million. In the opinion of management, a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency. As a result, a hypothetical 10% movement of the value of the U.S. dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the Companys earnings before interest and taxes by approximately $36 million for the year ended March 30, 2012. This amount would be offset, in part, from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense. As of March 30, 2012, the Company had approximately $788 million of cash and cash equivalents outside of the U.S. and approximately $43 million of non U.S. dollar borrowings. 54
