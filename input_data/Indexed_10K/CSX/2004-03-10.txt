Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General CSX Corporation (CSX or the Company) operates one of the largest rail networks in the United States and also arranges for and provides integrated rail and truck (intermodal) transportation services across the United States and key markets in Canada and Mexico. Surface Transportation, which includes CSXs rail and intermodal units, generated revenue of $7.4 billion in 2003 compared to $7.2 billion in 2002. Operating income for Surface Transportation was $651 million in 2003 compared to $995 million in 2002. CSXs marine operations include an international terminal services company, which operates and develops container terminals, 9 distribution facilities and related terminal activities. In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its domestic container shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group. CSX also owns and operates the Greenbrier, a AAA Five Diamond resort located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. In 2003, revenue and volume grew in response to strategies to persuade new customers to ship via a combination of rail and truck, the introduction of new customer services, and the economic recovery. However, as discussed below increased costs and operating inefficiency in the rail network decreased CSXs overall profitability. Surface Transportation CSXs rail system is a network, defined by its more than 23,000 route miles, through which goods and services flow. The inefficiency of any one element in that network can have an effect on other components, and ultimately affect the operating efficiency of the entire network. The decline in CSXs operating efficiency, coupled with the increased price of fuel and other higher costs, reduced CSXs profit in 2003. In addition to reviewing various financial measures, CSX management uses non financial indicators to monitor performance and operating efficiency of its network. Those include: % Improvement Key Non Financial Performance Indicators 2003 2002 (Decline) Personal Injury Frequency Index (Per 100 Employees) 2.20 1.98 (11 )% FRA Train Accidents Frequency (Per Million Train Miles) 4.37 3.34 (31 ) Average Velocity, All Trains (Miles Per Hour) 21.1 22.5 (6 ) Average System Dwell Time (Hours) 25.3 23.2 (9 ) Average Total Cars On Line 229,926 229,609 On Time Originations 62.0 % 76.4 % (19 ) On Time Arrivals 56.9 % 76.9 % (26 ) Average Recrews (Per Day) 50 26 (92 )% The decline in these non financial performance measures contributed to higher operating expenses and resulted in a higher operating ratio for Surface Transportation, which increased to 91.2% in 2003 from 86.1% in 2002. The number of injuries per 100 employees increased by 11%, while the number of FRA reportable train accidents per million train miles showed a 31% increase from 2002 to 2003. Average train velocity, which is a measure of efficiency, decreased 6% from 22.5 miles per hour in 2002 to 21.1 miles per hour in 2003. The average system dwell time, which measures the amount of time between car arrival and departure from yards, increased 9% from 2002 to 2003. The percent of scheduled trains departing the origin station at or prior to the scheduled departure time and the percent of scheduled trains arriving at the destination station within two hours of the scheduled arrival time both showed year over year declines. The number of relief crews called per day on average, which is an indicator of efficiency in the use of crews, showed the largest percent decline, increasing from 26 to 50. CSX management is taking steps to identify the source of operating inefficiencies and reduce operating expenses. Management also is evaluating ways to restore the network operating efficiency, while maintaining volume. This includes reducing both gross ton miles and the number of times a railcar is handled, or switched, en route to its final destination. Because American industry has changed significantly in recent years. Management believes there are portions of CSXs non core network that could be more efficiently used by third parties. The Company is currently evaluating the lease or sale of up to 3,000 miles of its non core network. This would allow CSX to return approximately 50 locomotives to the core network, reduce capital outlays and decrease operating expenses. 10 These changes will allow for and require organizational improvements. CSX is undertaking a major management restructuring that began in November 2003 and is expected to conclude near the end of the first quarter of 2004. Management believes that the conveyance of CSX Lines in February of 2003 and the resolution of the disputes with Maersk relating to the 1999 sale of the international container shipping assets will allow management to focus on its core surface transportation segment. International Terminals CSX World Terminals (CSXWT) Hong Kong terminal accounted for approximately 67% of CSXWTs revenues and 62% of operating income in 2003. The Hong Kong terminal showed a year over year volume decrease of 7.2%, which corresponded with a 5.8% decrease in revenue versus 2002. Competitive pressures are rising as customers are shifting their traffic from facilities in Hong Kong to newly opened terminals in South Chinas Guangdong region. This shift will also translate into reduced volumes and revenue. A significant customer of CSXWT announced that it would terminate its marine terminal services contract during the first quarter of 2004. This is expected to negatively impact CSXWTs 2004 operating income by approximately $29 million and cash flow by approximately $21 million. In December 2004, another contract is scheduled to expire. Negotiations are in process to maintain this contract, but if negotiations are unsuccessful, 2005 operating income may be negatively impacted by $20 million. CSXWT expects that it will be able to replace all or substantially all of the lost volume with new customers representing long and short term commercial commitments. However, due to the increased competitive pressures, it is possible that the profit margins achieved in the past will not be realized in the near term. Recognizing its need to diversify beyond the Hong Kong terminal, CSXWT has been expanding its capacity and market reach. During 2003, CSXs minority owned terminal operation located in the Shandong Province of the Peoples Republic of China commenced operations. CSXWT has also completed the first phase of its terminal construction in Caucedo, which is located in the Dominican Republic. The Caucedo terminal company is an unconsolidated entity of CSXWT that began operations in December 2003. In response to competition in the South China Guangdong region, CSXWT has initiatives in process to maintain and improve its productivity standards. In addition to volume, CSXWT monitors terminal productivity or lifts per hour. For the years ended December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, lifts per hour for some of the main terminals was as follows: Lifts Per Hour Ports % of CSXWT % Improvement Terminal Operating Income 2003 2002 (Decline) Hong Kong, China 62 % 40.4 39.1 3 % Adelaide, Australia 5 % 22.3 21.6 3 % Germershiem, Germany 5 % 23.7 25.2 (6 )% Rio Haina, Dominican Republic 5 % 25.8 26.1 (1 )% Overall, terminal productivity remained relatively stable in 2003 compared to 2002. Financial Results of Operations Consolidated Results CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. 11 2003 vs. 2002 Operating Revenue Operating revenue decreased $359 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 to $7.8 billion, compared to $8.2 billion for the prior year. A $627 million decline in consolidated revenue resulted from a reduction of revenue in the domestic container shipping segment as a majority of CSXs interest in CSX Lines was conveyed during the first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures). Excluding revenue from this conveyance, revenue increased $268 million primarily due to an increase in Surface Transportation revenue. Operating Income Operating income for the year ended December 26, 2003 was down $501 million to $626 million, compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. The prior year included $38 million of operating income of CSX Lines, which was conveyed to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group in the first quarter of 2003. Excluding operating income from this conveyance, 2003 operating income decreased $463 million. The decrease in operating income is primarily the result of two charges taken during 2003 totaling $340 million. The Company recorded a $232 million charge in conjunction with the change in estimate for casualty reserves, which is reflected in operating expense as Provision for Casualty Claims (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves). Also, CSX entered into two settlement agreements, which together resolve all material outstanding disputes with Maersk. This decreased the Companys operating income by $108 million, and is reflected in operating expense as the additional loss on sale of international container shipping assets (See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies). The Company also recorded $34 million pretax as the initial charge for separation expenses related to the management restructuring announced in November 2003. In addition, the Company recorded a credit of $22 million pretax related to revised estimates for railroad retirement taxes and the amount of benefits that will ultimately be paid to individuals under the $1.3 billion charges for separation plans initially recorded in 1991 and 1992. For the year, the Company has recorded a net restructuring charge of $22 million that includes these items and additional separation charges that were included in the third quarter results. (See Note 4, Restructuring). Materials, supplies and other expenses decreased $62 million, or 4%, year over year, as a result of the conveyance of most of the Companys interest in its domestic container shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines. Excluding the $244 million of expenses of CSX Lines, materials, supplies and other increased $193 million year over year. Approximately $80 million of this increase relates to increased costs for personal injuries and safety issues. An additional $20 million of the expense deterioration is due to increased cost of derailments. The remaining increase results from volume increases, inflationary effects and general operational inefficiencies, as reflected by the decline in the non financial performance indicators. Fuel expense for Surface Transportation operations increased $117 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year. The expense increase is primarily due to $102 million in fuel price increases, while increased volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of fuel was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure to fuel price fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered into a series of swaps in order to fix the price on a portion of its estimated future fuel purchases. As of December 26, 2003, 18% and 21% of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel purchases were hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended December 26, 2003. 12 Favorably impacting expense was the absence of a management bonus at its Surface Transportation companies in 2003, as approximately $45 million of such expense was recorded in 2002. Other Income Other income increased $16 million to $57 million for the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to $41 million for the prior year. A decrease in discounts on sales of accounts receivable due to the discontinuance of this program and a loss on sale in 2002 that did not recur in 2003 had a favorable impact, but were partially offset by lower interest income and reduced real estate gains. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $27 million for the year ended December 26, 2003 as compared to the prior year. Lower interest rates on floating rate debt and the favorable impact of interest rate swaps (see Note 12, Derivative Financial Instruments) continued to benefit the Company. Net Earnings Net earnings were $246 million, or $1.14 per share, for the year ended December 26, 2003, compared to $424 million, or $1.99 per share for the prior year. The year ended December 26, 2003 included an after tax cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of $57 million, 26 cents per share, related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, while the year ended December 27, 2002 included an after tax cumulative effect of accounting change charge of $43 million, 20 cents per share, related to the adoption of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Earnings before the cumulative effect of accounting changes were $189 million and $467 million for the years ended December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. The $278 million year over year decrease in net earnings primarily results from a $145 million after tax charge to increase the Companys provision for casualty reserves, a $67 million after tax charge to record the loss on sale of international container shipping assets and a $21 million after tax charge to record amounts associated with the management restructuring. The remaining decrease results from the decline in operating income as discussed above, somewhat offset by the favorable impact of decreased interest expenses and income taxes. 2002 vs. 2001 Operating Revenue Fiscal year 2001 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 28, 2001. Operating revenue of $8.2 billion in 2002 was slightly higher than 2001, resulting mainly from an increase in revenues at the Companys domestic container shipping unit, CSX Lines, which offset a small decrease at the Companys Surface Transportation units. Operating Income Operating expense of $7.0 billion in 2002 was 2% lower due mainly to lower fuel and labor costs at the Companys Surface Transportation business. The effect on 2001 of the $60 million New Orleans litigation settlement contributed to the favorable year to year comparison. 13 Other Income Other income was up $32 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due mainly to reduced losses relating to equity investments and other favorable miscellaneous items, offset by lower interest income. Interest Expense Interest expense was reduced by $73 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to refinancing fixed rate maturities at lower interest rates, and to a greater percentage of outstanding debt during 2002 bearing a floating rate of interest through the use of interest rate swap agreements. Net Earnings The Company reported net earnings for 2002 of $424 million, $1.99 per share, compared to $293 million, $1.38 per share in 2001. Results for 2002 include the write down of indefinite lived intangible assets as a cumulative effect of accounting change, which reduced net earnings $43 million after tax. Results for 2001 include a provision to account for the settlement of the New Orleans tank car fire litigation, which reduced net earnings by $37 million after tax. Excluding the cumulative effect of the accounting change and the New Orleans litigation provision, net earnings were $467 million for 2002, compared with $330 million for 2001. This increase is the result of increased operating income on a consolidated basis of $110 million (excluding the pretax charge of $60 million in 2001 for the New Orleans litigation provision), higher other income of $32 million and lower interest expense of $73 million.

Merchandise, which includes the following markets: Phosphates and Fertilizers Metals Forest and Industrial Agricultural and Food Chemicals Emerging Markets 2. Automotive 3. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Merchandise Revenue Merchandise showed strength during 2003 with revenue up 5% on 4% volume growth. All markets showed year over year revenue improvement, and all except phosphates and fertilizers experienced increased volumes. Emerging markets realized the most improvement, with 18% revenue growth on 12% volume growth. Aggregates and cement traffic grew faster than average industry growth rates due to new industrial development and increased conversion of truck traffic to rail. Ammunition volumes increased throughout the year and strength continued in waste markets. The metals sector also showed strength in 2003. Revenue improved 8% on 9% volume growth, driven by strong global steel demand, particularly for scrap and sheet steel. Other factors contributing to improvement include strength in semi finish metals and continued increases in modal conversions. Demand for building products, lumber and paper products resulted in an increase in forest and industrial revenue of 5% on 2% volume growth. The agricultural and food and chemical sectors also realized revenue increases, while volumes remained consistent with 2002. Phosphates and fertilizers revenues increased slightly year over year despite decreased volume, due to domestic phosphates and ammonia strength. Automotive Revenue Volume declined largely due to a 200,000 unit year over year decrease in North American light vehicle production. Haul extensions and price increases drove improvements in revenue per car. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Revenue Coal, coke and iron ore volumes and revenue remained consistent with results in the prior year. Export moves were strong due to high European steam coal demand for electricity generation. Steel related traffic was weak throughout the year, but showed renewed strength during the fourth quarter due to consolidation in the steel industry and shifts in scrap metal demands that resulted in increased traffic and revenue for CSX. Utility revenue was favorable due to pricing initiatives and higher average length of haul. Improvements in these areas were offset by abnormally harsh winter weather during the first quarter which adversely affected lake loadings, as lakes were frozen. 17 Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses increased $492 million, or 10% in 2003 as compared to 2002. Increases in most expense categories were somewhat offset by decreases in building and equipment rent. The primary component of the expense increase was a charge of $229 million recorded in conjunction with the Companys change in estimate for its casualty reserves to include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received over the next seven years. This charge is reflected as Provision for Casualty Claims in the financial statements. (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves.) Labor and fringe expense remained relatively consistent year over year. The cost of labor inflation was offset by December over December reductions in staff of approximately 1,200 and the favorable impact of the absence of a management bonus in 2003, as approximately $45 million of such expense was recorded in 2002. Materials, supplies and other expenses increased $117 million, or 10%, year over year. One of the primary drivers was approximately $80 million of increased cost for personal injury and related safety issues. An additional $20 million of the expense deterioration is due to increased cost of derailments. Additionally, due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, as discussed below, depreciation expense has been decreased and materials, supplies and other increased to account for the discontinuation of the accrual of cross tie removal as a component of depreciation expense. The remaining increase results from volume increases, inflationary effects and general operational inefficiencies. Conrail rents, fees & services expense increased $20 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year, as a result of increased usage of Shared Asset Areas, a contractual increase in the rental fee for Shared Area facilities, and a favorable tax adjustment in the prior year. (See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations With Conrail.) Building and equipment rent decreased $7 million in 2003 compared to the prior year principally as a result of reduced car rentals from other railroads. Inland transportation, which represents CSXIs use of the CSXT rail networks, remained relatively consistent year over year. The offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in CSXIs operating expense, and thus eliminates on a Surface Transportation level. Depreciation remained consistent year over year. The rail segment had capital additions of approximately $1 billion, but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. In conjunction with the group life method of accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. The effect is to decrease depreciation expense and increase material, supplies and other expense. Fuel expense increased $117 million in 2003, as compared to the prior year. The expense increase is primarily due to $102 million in fuel price increases, while increased volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of fuel was 96 cents per gallon for 2003 compared to 78 cents per gallon for 2002. In order to minimize future exposure to fuel price fluctuation risk, during 2003 the Company entered into a series of swaps in order to fix the price of a portion of its estimated future fuel purchases. As of December 26, 2003, 18% and 21% of 2004 and 2005, respectively, estimated fuel purchases were hedged. Fuel swaps did not have an effect on fuel expense for the year ended December 26, 2003. The net $22 million restructuring charge in 2003 represents the cost of CSXs reorganization charges offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. (See Note 4, Restructuring.) 18 Operating Income Operating income decreased $313 million to $541 million in 2003, compared to $854 million in 2002 primarily due to the $229 million provision for casualty claims, the $22 million net restructuring charge and other expense increases as previously discussed. Excluding the provision for casualty claims and net restructuring charge, operating income would have been $792 million. 2002 vs. 2001 Operating Revenue Overall rail revenues were down $79 million to $6.0 billion in 2002, with increases in merchandise and automotive revenues being offset by lower coal revenues. CSXs pricing programs and product mix helped overcome a 3% decrease in carloads in 2002. Merchandise Revenue Overall merchandise revenues were up 1%, or $47 million in 2002 over 2001. Improvements in phosphates and fertilizers, chemicals, emerging markets, metals and paper and forest products more than offset decreases in minerals, agricultural products and food and consumer products. Pricing programs and favorable mix helped the Company offset the effect of a small decrease in merchandise carloads in 2002 as compared to 2001. Automotive Revenue Automotive revenues improved 6%, or $51 million in 2002 as a result of yield improvement driven by favorable mix and extended linehauls. Year over year volume increases were driven by higher light truck production levels and aggressive manufacturer incentives that stimulated automobile sales during 2002. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Revenue Coal revenues had a significant impact on the rail segments 2002 financial results. Coal revenue was down 9%, or $143 million from 2001s strong performance due to reduced volumes. Export carloads were down significantly as a result of the reduced competitive standing of U.S. coal in the international market, while metallurgical and industrial markets were down in the second half of 2002. Other Revenue Other revenue decreased $35 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily because there were lower fuel surcharges billed to customers. Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses decreased $190 million, or 4% in 2002 as compared to 2001. Reductions in most expense categories were somewhat offset by increases in depreciation and reduced intercompany volume with CSX Intermodal. Also, 2001 included $60 million relating to the New Orleans litigation settlement. Fuel costs decreased $76 million in 2002, of which $69 million is attributable to lower fuel prices. The net impact on operating income of reduced fuel price was $44 million since $25 million of fuel surcharge revenue was discontinued. Labor and fringe costs decreased $44 million year over year including savings from reductions in overall employment. These savings were offset by increased labor costs relating to cost of living wage increases. Employee count was approximately 950 lower at the end of 2002 as compared to 2001. 19 Building and equipment costs were down $17 million mainly due to continued reduction in car hire as the railroad took cars offline and ran more efficiently. Conrail operating fees, rents and services decreased $14 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. Decreased costs in operating the shared asset areas, tax settlements, efficiency improvements and adjustments to reflect lower reserve requirements for car hire, overcharges, interline and other claims all reduced this expense. Materials, supplies and other costs at the rail unit were down $11 million in 2002, as compared to 2001, due to reduced transportation costs, fewer accidents and adjustments to estimated state and local tax liabilities to reflect actual assessments. These decreases were offset by higher legal fees and maintenance costs, and $40 million in favorable insurance settlements received in 2001 that were not repeated in 2002. Depreciation expense increased $26 million as compared to 2001, as a result of a higher depreciable asset base. Operating Income Rail operating income increased by $111 million to $854 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to operating expense decreases noted previously and the New Orleans litigation provision. Excluding the 2001 charge for the New Orleans litigation provision, operating income was up $51 million or 6% for the year. Intermodal 2003 vs. 2002 CSX Intermodal domestic revenue improved 13% on 8% volume increase due to increased unloading and loading (transloading) of international containers into domestic containers and new programs. Strength in truck brokerage continued due to the rollout of the new Pegasus information management system, which provides real time information regarding driver availability and location, service quality tracking and financial performance. The parcel sector also showed year over year strength. International strength in general import growth was partially offset by continued international import/export diversions of freight carried entirely via water routes from west coast ports to east coast ports. These diversions have resulted in volume declines, shorter hauls and lower per unit revenue. Intermodal operating expense increased $108 million compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarily to traffic mix and inflationary factors. Additionally, the Company recognized a $15 million positive contract settlement in 2002. Operating income decreased to $110 million in 2003, compared to $141 million in the prior year. 2002 vs. 2001 CSXI reported operating revenue of $1.2 billion in 2002, as compared to $1.1 billion in 2001. The increase was primarily due to continued success in efforts to convert truck traffic onto the intermodal network. CSXI operating expense increased $31 million in 2002. This increase was the result of $32 million in higher inland transportation costs due to increased volumes handled during 2002. Also, due to volume increases, building and equipment rent increased $8 million, and materials, supplies and other increased $6 million. The increase was partially offset by a $15 million positive contract settlement. Other costs were relatively flat year over year. CSXI operating income was up $37 million in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to the $68 million increase in revenues, offset by a $31 million increase in operating expenses. These results were also impacted by the $15 million positive contract settlement noted above. 20 International Terminals 2003 vs. 2002 CSXWTs revenue decreased $10 million, or 4% to $226 million for 2003, compared to $236 million in the prior year, primarily due to weakness in the Hong Kong market. Expense decreased to $157 million for the year, compared to $167 million for 2002, partially attributable to reduced labor and fringe costs associated with reduced volume at its Hong Kong operations and a $6 million gain related to the divestiture of a portion of the Caucedo terminal ownership interest, which offset other miscellaneous expenses in 2002. Operating income remained consistent at $69 million in 2003 and 2002. During 2003, a significant customer of CSXWT announced that it would terminate its marine terminal services contract during the first quarter of 2004. This is expected to negatively impact CSXWTs 2004 operating income by approximately $29 million and cash flow by approximately $21 million. In December 2004, another contract is scheduled to expire. Negotiations are in process to maintain this contract, but if negotiations are unsuccessful, 2005 operating income may be negatively impacted by $20 million. CSXWT expects that it will be able to replace all or substantially all of the lost volume with new customers representing long and short term commercial commitments. However, due to the increased competitive pressures, it is possible that the profit margins achieved in the past will not be realized in the near term. Under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, companies are required to review their assets for potential impairment losses if there are certain impairment indicators present. Given these indicators, the Company evaluated the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by this terminal, whose long lived assets are recorded at $59 million, and concluded that the forecasted future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the book value of the assets; therefore no impairment write down is necessary at this time. 2002 vs. 2001 CSX World Terminals operating revenues were flat at $236 million in 2002 and 2001. Operating expenses were up $2 million in 2002 over 2001 due to lower earnings from equity investments. Miscellaneous operating expenses in 2002 and 2001 include $6 million and $3 million gains, respectively, from transactions relating to equity investments. Operating income was $69 million for 2002, a $2 million decrease from $71 million in 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources Operating Activities Cash provided by operations for 2003 was $804 million, compared to $1.1 billion for 2002, and $827 million in 2001. The $323 million decrease in 2003, as compared to the prior year, reflects the $380 million termination of the accounts receivable facility. (See Note 8, Accounts Receivable). Excluding that, cash provided by operating activities was slightly higher than 2002, at $1.2 billion. Real estate activities contributed $122 million to operating cash flow, as compared to $137 million provided in 2002. In 2002 cash provided from operations was $1.1 billion, a $300 million increase over 2001. Higher operating income, lower interest expense and significant cash flow relating to real estate activities contributed to the increase, while there was a $85 million negative effect attributable to the New Orleans tank car fire settlement payment. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was $807 million in 2003 compared to $775 million in 2002 and $965 million in 2001. While 2003 capital expenditures approximated 2002 levels, 21 reduced proceeds from maturities of short term investments led to the increase in cash used for investing activities. Proceeds of $214 million from the sale of CSX Lines in the first quarter of 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures) helped to offset the impact of reduced short term investment proceeds. Property additions totaled $1.1 billion in 2003 and 2002 and $930 million in 2001. The 2003 and 2002 increases over 2001 were related to replacement of cars and locomotives. Of Surface Transportations $1 billion in 2003 capital expenditures, substantially all related to replacing track, locomotives and other costs necessary to maintain the Companys rail system. 2004 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $1 billion. Financing Activities Financing activities provided cash of $172 million during 2003 and $15 million in 2001, compared to a $362 million use of cash during 2002. In 2003, net issuances of $419 million in long term debt were principally used to repay short term obligations incurred as a result of the termination of the Companys accounts receivable sales program. Debt Issuances and Credit Facilities In December 2003, CSX executed a $75 million revolving loan facility that matures in 2005. Borrowings under the facility will bear interest at a rate that fluctuates with LIBOR. In addition, the Company pays an annual commitment fee of 0.15% for the period the facility is not drawn. This debt may be redeemed at any time after May 2004, with additional borrowings allowed through the maturity of the facility. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had $75 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under this borrowing. In November 2003, CSX issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys Notes due 2014 and $200 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys Notes due 2006. The 2014 Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.30% per year and mature on February 15, 2014. The 2006 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.75% per year and mature on February 15, 2006. The 2014 Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time, but the 2006 Notes cannot be redeemed before maturity. In August 2003, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount Notes due 2013. These Notes bear interest at the rate of 5.50% and mature on August 1, 2013. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company at any time. CSX increased its borrowings from Conrail by approximately $144 million year over year in 2003 in addition to the $146 million increase in 2002. Also, during 2002 the Conrail note was extended to a five year term. During 2002, CSX issued $200 million of 4.88% notes due in 2009 and $400 million of 6.30% notes due in 2012. The Company has a $1 billion five year revolving credit facility and a $345 million 364 day revolving credit facility. Generally, these facilities may be used to support the Companys commercial paper, working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the 364 day facility, the Company pays an annual fee to the participating banks of .125% of total commitment. Under the five year facility, the Company pays annual fees to the participating banks that may range from 0.08% to 0.23% of total commitment, depending on the Companys credit rating. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. CSX had commercial paper borrowings supported by these credit facilities of approximately $140 million at the end of 2002. 22 Debt Repayments CSX repaid long term debt of $500 million in 2003, $1.2 billion in 2002, and $266 million in 2001. The Company also paid a net $141 million in short term debt during 2003. The primary sources of 2003 repayments were the $214 million of proceeds from the conveyance of CSX Lines (see Note 3, Divestitures) and the issuance of new debt. Long term and short term debt at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, totaled $7.3 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The ratio of debt to total capitalization was 51% at the end of 2003, and 52% at the end of 2002 and 2001. Convertible Debentures In October 2001, CSX issued $564 million aggregate principal amount at maturity in unsubordinated zero coupon convertible debentures (the debentures) due October 30, 2021 for an initial offering price of approximately $462 million. At December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, outstanding debentures are included in long term debt, at a carrying value of $447 million and $467 million, respectively. These debentures accrete (increase) in value at a yield to maturity of 1% per year. The accretion rate may be reset on October 30, 2007, October 30, 2011, and October 30, 2016 to a rate based on five year United States Treasury Notes minus 2.8%. In no event, however, will the yield to maturity be reset below 1% or above 3% per annum. Accretion in value on the debentures is recorded for each period, but will not be paid prior to maturity. Under the terms of the debentures, holders had the option to require the Company to purchase their debentures at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the debentures in October 2003. CSX purchased $15 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures at an aggregate cost of $13 million. In November 2003, the Company made a one time cash payment of $23.00 per $1,000 aggregate principal amount at maturity to holders who did not require the Company to purchase their debentures. This resulted in a $13 million cash payment, which will be amortized over the remaining term of the debentures. In addition, the terms of the debentures were amended to permit holders to cause the Company to purchase the debentures on October 30, 2005, at their accreted value of $852.48 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, in addition to the purchase dates provided under the terms of the debentures. Similarly, the debentures allow holders to require the Company to purchase their debentures in October 2006, October 2008, October 2011, and October 2016, at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the debentures. In 2005, 2006 and 2008, CSX may elect to pay the purchase price in cash and or shares of common stock, while CSX may pay the purchase price only in cash on the last two purchase dates. CSX may redeem the debentures for cash at any time on or after October 30, 2008, at a redemption price equal to the accreted value of the debentures. Holders may convert debentures into CSX common stock if certain requirements defined in the debentures and the related indenture are met. Holders may convert if the closing sale price of CSX common stock for at least 20 of the 30 preceding trading days is more than the applicable percentage (which is initially 120% and will decline over the life of the debentures to 110%) of the accreted conversion price per share of the Companys common stock. The accreted conversion price per share of common stock is the quotient of the accreted value of a debenture divided by the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of that debenture. Holders may also convert if the Companys senior long term unsecured credit ratings are downgraded by Moodys Investors Service Inc. to below Ba1 and by Standard & Poors Rating Services to below BB+, if the debentures have been called for redemption, if the Company makes specified distributions to holders of CSX common stock, or if the company is a party to specified consolidations, mergers, or transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the Companys assets. For each debenture surrendered for conversion, a holder will initially receive 17.75 shares of CSX common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $46.16 23 per share. The initial conversion rate will be adjusted for reasons specified in the indenture, but will not be adjusted for accretion. Instead, accretion on the debentures will be deemed paid by the common stock received by the holder on conversion. Shelf Registration Statements CSX has $600 million of remaining capacity under a shelf registration that may be used, subject to market conditions, to issue debt or other securities at the Companys discretion. The Company presently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under its shelf registration statements to finance cash requirements, including refinancing existing debt as it matures. While the Company seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting such needs, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit the Company to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. Dividends In mid year 2001, the board of directors announced that the regular quarterly dividend payable would be reduced to 10 cents per share. CSX had paid a regular quarterly dividend of 30 cents per share since the fourth quarter of 1997 and did so through June of 2001. Dividends paid in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 Dividend Per Share $ 0.40 $ 0.40 $ 0.80 Total Cash Paid for Dividends (In Millions) $ 86 $ 86 $ 171 Working Capital The Companys working capital deficit at December 26, 2003, was $307 million, as compared to $665 million at December 27, 2002. A working capital deficit is not unusual for the Company and other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day to day cash requirements and any obligations arising from legal, tax and other regulatory rulings. Credit Ratings As of December 26, 2003, CSX Corporations long term unsecured debt obligations were rated BBB and Baa2 by Standard and Poors and by Moodys Investor Service, respectively. In the event CSXs long term unsecured bond ratings were reduced to BBB and Baa3, the Companys drawn and undrawn borrowing costs under the $1.0 billion and $345 million revolving credit facilities would not materially increase. However, at year end 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. The Companys short term commercial paper program is rated A 2 and P 2 by Standard and Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. Should these ratings decline to A 3 and P 3, the companys cost and access to the commercial paper markets could be adversely affected. At year end 2003, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 24 Schedule of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth maturities of the Companys contractual obligations: Type of Obligation 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total (Millions of Dollars) Long term Debt (see Note 11)(a) $ 426 $ 247 $ 598 $ 1,080 $ 615 $ 4,291 $ 7,257 Operating Leases Net (see Note 18)(b) 150 138 112 117 98 516 1,131 Agreements with Conrail (see Note 2)(c) 260 247 236 229 224 3,118 4,314 Purchase Obligations (see Note 18)(d) 132 138 166 171 171 1,866 2,644 Total Contractual Obligations $ 968 $ 770 $ 1,112 $ 1,597 $ 1,108 $ 9,791 $ 15,346 The following table sets forth the maturities of the Companys other commitments: Type of Commitment 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Unused Lines of Credit (see Note 11) $ 345 $ $ 1,000 $ $ $ $ 1,345 Guarantees (see Note 18)(e) 140 122 98 140 102 240 842 Other 99 14 8 36 157 Total Other Commitments $ 584 $ 136 $ 1,106 $ 140 $ 102 $ 276 $ 2,344 (a) The fair market value of the interest rate swap agreements of $55 million, which is included in long term debt on the balance sheet, is not included on the debt maturity schedule. Capital leases of $206 million are included in long term debt. (b) CSX has entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for rail transportation equipment. (c) Agreements with Conrail represents commitments to pay Conrail per various agreements. (d) Commercial commitments consists of a $2.6 billion maintenance program which expires in 2026 relating to CSXs fleet of locomotives. This program replaced an internal maintenance program. (e) Approximately $440 million of these guarantees relate to certain lease obligations that CSX remains contingently liable for that were assumed by Maersk. Accordingly, CSX has collateral liens on the assets relating to these leases and indemnities provided by Maersk that it will fulfill the commitments. CSX believes that Maersk will fulfill its contractual commitments with respect to such leases and that CSX will have no further liabilities relating to these obligations. Approximately $97 million relates to construction and cash deficiency support guarantees at one of the Companys equity investments. CSX guarantees approximately $300 million relating to leases assumed as part of CSXs conveyance of its interest in CSX Lines. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off balance sheet arrangements, except as noted above, that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Market Risk CSX addresses market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company addresses its exposure to interest rate market risk through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of interest rate swap agreements. As of December 26, 2003, the Company had various interest rate swap agreements on $1.3 billion of its outstanding notes payable. In the event of a 1% increase or decrease in the LIBOR interest rate, the interest expense related to these agreements would increase or decrease approximately $13 million on an annual basis. 25 During 2003, the Company began a program to hedge its exposure to fuel price volatility through swap transactions. As of December 26, 2003, CSX has hedged approximately 18% and 21% of expected requirements for 2004 and 2005, respectively. The Company expects that by the end of 2004 the programs will result in an increase in the amount of fuel hedged to approximately 76% of 2005 annual purchases. At December 26, 2003, a 1% change in fuel prices would result in an increase or decrease in the asset related to the swaps of approximately $1 million. The Company is subject to risk relating to changes in the price of diesel fuel. At the end of 2003, the Company had not entered into any long term commitments for forward fuel purchases. The Companys rail unit average annual fuel consumption is approximately 570 million gallons. A one cent change in the price per gallon of fuel would impact fuel expense by approximately $6 million. The Company is exposed to loss in the event of non performance by any counter party to the interest rate swap or fuel hedging agreements. The Company does not anticipate non performance by such counter parties, and no material loss would be expected from non performance. Exclusive of derivative contracts that swap fixed rate notes to floating interest rates, at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, CSX had approximately $714 million and $709 million, respectively, of floating rate debt outstanding. A 1% variance in interest rates would on average effect annual interest expense by approximately $7 million. While the Companys international terminals segment does business in several foreign countries, a substantial portion of its revenue and expenses are transacted in U.S. dollars, or currencies with little fluctuation against the U.S. dollar. For this reason, CSX does not believe its foreign currency market risk is significant. A substantial increase in the fair market value of the Companys stock price could negatively impact earnings per share due to the dilutive effect of stock options and convertible debt. Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail See background, accounting and financial reporting effects and summary financial information in Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail. Conrails Results of Operations 2003 vs. 2002 Conrail Inc. (Conrail) reported net income of $203 million in 2003, which included a cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of $40 million. Excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change, net income was $163 million, as compared with $180 million in 2002. Operating revenues were up $25 million to $918 million from the prior year. However, operating expenses were up 6% to $659 million. In June 2003, CSX, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NS) and Conrail jointly filed a petition with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to establish direct ownership and control by CSXs and NS respective subsidiaries, CSX Transportation Inc. (CSXT) and Norfolk Southern Railway (NSR) of their portions of the Conrail system already operated by them separately and independently under various agreements. These portions of the Conrail system are currently owned by Conrails subsidiaries, New York Central Lines LLC (NYC) and Pennsylvania Lines LLC (PRR). The ownership of NYC and PRR would be transferred (spun off) to CSXT and NSR, respectively. Conrail would continue to own, manage and operate the Shared Asset Areas as previously approved by the STB. STB approval to proceed with the spin off transaction and a favorable ruling from the IRS qualifying the 26 transaction as a non taxable disposition were received in November 2003. The transaction remains subject to a number of other conditions. If all necessary conditions are satisfied, unsecured debt securities of newly formed subsidiaries of CSXT and NSR would be offered in a 42%/58% ratio in exchange for Conrails unsecured debentures. The debt securities issued by its respective subsidiary would be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CSXT or NSR. Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the subsidiaries would be merged into CSXT and NSR, respectively, and the new debt securities thus would become direct unsecured obligations of CSXT or NSR. Conrails secured debt and lease obligations will remain obligations of Conrail and are expected to be supported by new leases and subleases which, upon completion of the proposed transaction, would be the direct lease and sublease obligations, also on a 42%/58% ratio, of CSXT and NSR. CSX will record the proposed transaction at fair value based on the results of an independent valuation of NYC, with any difference from carrying value resulting in a gain or loss. The Company can not predict the outcome of the valuation and the impact on the Companys financial statements. CSX, NS and Conrail are working to complete the spin off transaction in 2004. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, CSXs investment in Conrail will no longer include the amounts related to NYC and PRR. Instead the assets and liabilities of NYC will be reflected in their respective line items in CSXs consolidated balance sheet. Conrail will continue to own, manage and operate the Shared Asset Areas. 2002 vs. 2001 Conrail reported net income of $180 million in 2002, compared with $174 million in 2001. Operating revenues were down $10 million to $893 million in 2002, while operating expenses were favorable $16 million year over year. Lower costs in the Shared Asset Areas, tax settlements and lower reserve requirements for car hire, overcharges, interline and other claims helped improve 2002 results. Financial Condition and Liquidity Conrails operating activities provided cash of $412 million in 2003, compared with $423 million in 2002 and $502 million in 2001. The decrease in cash provided by operations in 2003 is a result of decreased operating income. The decrease in cash provided by operations in 2002 compared to 2001 reflected large payments of casualty claims. Cash generated from operations is the principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures. Debt repayments totaled $57 million, $59 million and $61 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital expenditures were $35 million, $23 million and $47 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total cash used for financing activities was $360 million, most of which results from an increase in the amount receivable from CSX and Norfolk Southern under their respective notes (See Note 2, Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail). Conrail had working capital deficits of $22 million and $29 million at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. A working capital deficit is not unusual for the Company and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day to day cash requirements and any obligations arising from legal, tax and other regulatory rulings. Divestitures In February 2003, CSX conveyed most of its interest in its domestic container shipping subsidiary, CSX Lines LLC (CSX Lines), to a new venture formed with the Carlyle Group for approximately $300 million (gross cash proceeds of approximately $240 million, $214 million net of transaction costs, and $60 million of securities). CSX Lines was subsequently renamed 27 Horizon Lines LLC (Horizon). Horizon has subleased equipment and or assigned vessel leases from certain affiliates of CSX covering the primary financial obligations related to $300 million of leases under which CSX or one of its affiliates will remain a lessee/ sublessor or guarantor. A deferred pretax gain of approximately $127 million as a result of the transaction will be recognized over the 12 year sub lease term. Approximately $9 million of this gain was recognized during 2003. The securities have a term of 7 years and a preferred return feature. During the third quarter, CSX received a $15 million payment from Horizon Lines, which included $3 million of interest, in return of a portion of its investment in Horizon and now holds $48 million of securities. Other Matters Matters Arising out of Sale of International Container Shipping Assets In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of two major disputes. The first dispute involved a post closing working capital adjustment to the sale price for which the Company had recorded a receivable of approximately $70 million. The second dispute involved a claim of 425 million Dutch Guilders (approximately $180 million at then prevailing currency exchange rates) plus interest by Europe Container Terminals BV (ECT) alleging breaches of contract by the Company at the Rotterdam container terminal facility owned by ECT. Also in 2003, CSX entered into a final settlement agreement with Maersk allocating responsibility between the two companies for third party claims and litigation relating to the assets acquired by Maersk. The two settlements reduced the Companys 2003 earnings by $108 million pretax, $67 million after tax. This charge is reflected in the financial statements as an additional loss on the sale of the international container shipping assets. Neither settlement has a material impact on cash flows. Restructuring In November 2003, the Company announced a management restructuring plan to streamline the structure at a number of its companies, eliminate organizational layers and realign certain functions. The initiative will reduce the non union workforce by 800 to 1,000 positions over the last quarter of 2003 and the first half of 2004. As of December 26, 2003, 20 employees have been terminated under this program. The Company recorded an initial charge related to this reduction of $34 million pretax, in 2003, to record the lowest amount of expense to be incurred under this program. The total estimated cost of the program is expected to be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. The majority of separation benefits will be paid from CSXs qualified pension plans, with the remainder being paid from general corporate funds. Also in 2003, the Company recorded a $10 million restructuring charge related to another workforce reduction program. Substantially all of this amount had been paid out at December 27, 2003. In 2003, the Company recorded a $22 million pretax credit related to a favorable change in estimate related to the 1991 and 1992 separation plans. These plans provided for workforce reductions, improvements in productivity and other cost reductions. The reduction in estimate for these plans results from lower railroad retirement taxes and other benefits than had been built into the initial $1.3 billion charge. A net $22 million restructuring charge was recorded representing the cost of the restructuring initiatives offset by reductions in 1991/1992 separation reserves. The associated expense is included in operating expense on the Income Statement as Restructuring Charge Net. 28 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: 1. Casualty, legal and environmental reserves 2. Pension and postretirement medical plan accounting 3. Depreciation policies for its assets under the group life method These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. 1. Casualty, Legal and Environmental Reserves Casualty Reserve Management Casualty reserves represent accruals for the uninsured portion of occupational injury and personal injury claims. These reserves are recorded upon the first reporting of a claim, and estimates are updated as information develops. The amount of liability accrued is based on the type and severity of the claim, and an estimate of future claims development based on current trends and historical data. The Company believes it has recorded liabilities in sufficient amounts to cover all identified claims and estimates of incurred but not reported personal injury claims for the next seven years. During 2003, the Company retained third party professionals to work with it to project the number of asbestos and other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years and the related costs. Based on this analysis the Company established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable asbestos and other occupational injury liabilities. Other occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place, such as solvents and diesel fuel, or alleged physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss. In conjunction with the change in estimate, in 2003 the Company recorded a charge of $206 million to increase its provision for these claims. Approximately $141 million of this amount relates to asbestos claims. Additionally, the provision for personal injury claims was increased by $26 million as a result of a change in estimate. Estimates for all of these claims are subject to significant uncertainty relating to the outcomes of negotiated settlements and other developments and are not suited to subjecting to a sensitivity analysis. As facts and circumstances change, the Company may have to change its estimates, and changes could have a material impact on the Companys financial results. Events such as adverse verdicts, catastrophic accidents and legal settlements will cause the Company to revise its estimated liabilities, which the Company reviews and appropriately adjusts quarterly. Personal and occupational injury liabilities amount to $864 million and $605 million at December 26, 2003 and December 27, 2002, respectively. (See Note 10, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves). Legal Reserves In accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is (1) probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the 29 contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities on an ongoing basis and records reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. In 2003, CSX finalized a settlement agreement with Maersk resolving all remaining material disputes pending directly between the two companies, consisting predominantly of two major disputes. The two settlements reduced the Companys 2003 earnings by $108 million pretax, $67 million after tax. This charge is reflected in the financial statements as an additional loss on the sale of the international container shipping assets. Neither settlement has a material impact on cash flows. In 2001 Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) filed a complaint before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board alleging that certain CSXT common carrier coal rates are unreasonably high. In February 2004, the STB issued a decision finding that the CSXT common carrier rates were reasonable. While approving the rate levels, the STB also invited Duke to request a phase in of rate increases over some time period. The nature and amount of any such phase in is uncertain, and would only apply to billings subsequent to December 2001. CSXT will continue to consider and pursue all available legal defenses in this matter. Administrative and legal appeals are possible, and could take several years to resolve. An unfavorable outcome to this complaint would not have a material effect on the Company. The Company increased a reserve in 2001 to account for the impact of the negotiated settlement of the New Orleans tank car fire. This negotiation resulted in the Company recording an additional charge of $60 million pretax, $37 million after tax in 2001. Environmental Management CSXT is a party to various proceedings, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues. CSXT has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 260 environmentally impaired sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Superfund statute (Superfund) or similar state statutes. A number of these proceedings are based on allegations that CSXT, or its railroad predecessors, sent hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal. Some of the proceedings involve property formerly or currently owned by CSXT or its railroad predecessors. Proceedings arising under Superfund or similar state statutes can involve numerous other companies who generated the waste or owned or operated the property and involve the allocation of liability for costs associated with site investigation and cleanup, which could be substantial. At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role with respect to each such location, giving consideration to a number of factors, including: the type of cleanup required, the nature of CSXTs alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site, or owner or operator of the site), the extent of CSXTs alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors), the accuracy and strength of evidence connecting CSXT to the location, and the number, connection, and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRPs at the location. Based on the review process, CSXT has recorded reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental costs with respect to such sites. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs at December 26, 2003, and December 27, 2002 were $45 million and 30 $35 million, respectively. These liabilities, which are undiscounted, include amounts representing CSXTs estimate of unasserted claims, which CSXT believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for all sites where the Companys obligation is (1) deemed probable and (2) can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. During 2003, the Company increased its estimate for environmental liabilities by a net $10 million due to continuing evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve. The majority of the December 26, 2003 environmental liability is expected to be paid out over the next seven years. The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. Also, changes in federal and state laws and regulations may impact, favorably or unfavorably, the effort required to remediate sites. In addition, latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations and financial condition. 2. Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans, principally for salaried personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based principally on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company sponsors three plans that provide medical and life insurance benefits to most full time salaried employees upon their retirement. The postretirement medical plans are contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non contributory. The benefit obligation for these plans represents the liability of the Company for current and retired employees and is affected primarily by the following: 1. Service cost (benefits attributed to employee service during the period) 2. Interest cost (interest on the liability due to the passage of time) 3. Actuarial gains/losses (experience during the year different from that assumed and changes in plan assumptions) 4. Benefits paid to participants Plan assets are amounts that have been segregated and restricted to provide benefits, and include amounts contributed by the Company and amounts earned from investing contributions, less benefits paid. The pension plans are funded at not less than the minimum funding standards set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Plan assets consist primarily of common stocks, corporate bonds and cash and cash equivalents. The Company funds the cost of the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits on a pay as you go basis. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the following: 1. Long term rate of return of plan assets 2. Discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense 3. Salary scale inflation rates 4. Health care cost trend rates and other assumptions 31 All of these assumptions and estimates can have a significant impact on the Companys accounting for these plans and the amount of expense recorded in a reporting period. These assumptions are made as of the beginning of the year. The Company uses a plan year of Oct. 1 through Sept. 30 to value its pension and postretirement plans on an actuarial basis. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use this fiscal year as it provides for more timely analysis. The Company engages third party actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects for its plans. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Additionally, as CSX expects a curtailment (event that impacts the future service, and therefore benefits, to be earned by employees under the plan), to occur in the first quarter of 2004 as a result of the Management Restructuring, and accordingly, will review actuarial assumptions as required by SFAS 88 and SFAS 106. The impact of the curtailment is expected to be immaterial. Currently, the Company does not expect any significant changes to its assumptions. Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected return on the Companys pension plan assets is based on the Companys expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds (based on a composite yield of AA rated corporate bonds), which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds. As this estimate is long term, it is not adjusted as frequently as other assumptions used in pension accounting. However, the impact of the last few years overall market returns did cause CSX to reevaluate the rate used in calculating its liability at September 30, 2002 (the end of the measurement period for 2002) and adjust it from 9.5% to 8.9%. This change will increase the amount of pension expense reported in future periods. The Company evaluated the investment performance during 2003 as well as future expectations and determined that an adjustment to the long term rate of return is not warranted. CSX will continue to evaluate its performance on an ongoing basis and if appropriate will adjust the long term rate of return. A 1% change in the rate of return assumption would change pension expense by $15 million. Discount Rates Discount rates are based on comparable rates for long term liabilities that reflect a similar time horizon to payments that the Company will make for pension and postretirement medical payments. These rates are analyzed every year and adjusted accordingly. As such, management has minimal discretion with respect to the discount rates used. The discount rate impacts the amount of liability recorded and also the amount of the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense. CSXs assumed discount rates used in calculating the liability at September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, respectively, were 6.0% and 6.5% for the pension liabilities and 5.0% and 5.5% for postretirement medical benefits. The difference between the rate used for pension vs. postretirement is due to the different time horizon of future payments. Salary Scale Inflation Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews this assumption on a regular basis and makes adjustments when appropriate. CSX lowered this rate from 4.5% in 2001 to 3.3% for 2002 and 2003. Health Care Cost Trend Rates The health care cost trend rate is based on current trends and historical data. Due to the increasing costs of providing health care benefits, the Company increased the inflation assumption for health care costs for the 2002 year. No changes were deemed necessary to the health care cost trend rate in 2003. The current assumed rate is 11% decreasing gradually until 32 reaching 4.5% in 2012. A 1% change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would effect expense by $2 million. Summary Pension Assumptions Postretirement Pension Benefits Benefits 2003 2002 2003 2002 (Dollars in Millions) Expected Long term Return on Plan Assets: Benefit Cost for Plan Year 8.90% 9.50% n/a n/a Benefit Obligation at End of Plan Year 8.90% 8.90% n/a n/a Discount Rates: Benefit Cost for Plan Year 6.50% 7.25% 5.50% 7.25% Benefit Obligation at End of Plan Year 6.00% 6.50% 5.00% 5.50% Salary Scale Inflation 3.30% 3.30% 3.30% 3.30% Other Assumptions Relating to Pensions and Postretirement Benefits The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, and retirement age. These assumptions are based on historical data and are approved by management. As a result of changes in assumptions for fiscal year 2004, net periodic pension benefit cost and postretirement benefit costs for 2004 are expected to increase approximately $7 million. In December 2003, the President of the United States signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act), which introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. SFAS 106 requires that changes in the law that take effect in the future and affect future benefit coverage shall be considered in current period benefit measurements. However, as significant uncertainties exist for how to account for the subsidy a plan sponsor may not have sufficient information available to measure effects of the Act, prepare related actuarial valuations, and ensure proper accounting. Therefore, FASB has issued staff position No. FAS 106 1 which allows a plan sponsor to elect to defer recognizing the effects of the Act until authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued, or until certain other events occur. When the guidance is issued, it may cause CSX to revise previously reported information. CSX is currently evaluating how this legislation may impact its postretirement benefit plans. (See Note 17, Employee Benefit Plans.) 3. Depreciation Policies Under the Group Life Method The Company accounts for its rail assets, including main line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group life method. This method pools similar assets by road and equipment type and then depreciates each group as a whole. These assets represent 94% of the Companys total fixed assets and amounted to $12.9 billion on a net basis at December 26, 2003. Under the group life method, the useful lives of rail assets are determined by the performance of a life study which includes: statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property evaluation of the current operations previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. 33 The results of the life study process determine the service lives for each asset group. These studies are conducted by a third party expert and analyzed by the Companys management. Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and thus the Companys results of operations. Events that could cause the Company to change its estimates relating to the lives of its asset groups could be changes in historical results, technological improvements and changes in specific assets. In 2003, the Company completed life studies for all of its rail assets. The effect of theses studies was to increase the average useful lives on its equipment and track assets, while decreasing the average useful lives on many of the roadway assets. These changes in average useful lives of the assets will have minimal net reduction on depreciation expense in the future. As a result, the net increase in depreciation expense was $1 million in 2003, while the impact will be a decrease of approximately $13 million in 2004 and thereafter. Additionally, with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations in 2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million, $57 million after tax as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, representing the reversal of the accrued liability for crosstie removal costs. On an ongoing basis, depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by approximately $12 million annually. In 2003, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants voted to approve the Statement of Position (SOP) Accounting for Certain Costs and Activities related to Property, Plant and Equipment and presented it to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for approval. If the FASB causes the SOP to be applicable, certain costs and activities that are currently capitalized may require immediate recognition and alternatively, some costs and activities that are currently expensed may require capitalization. In addition, the SOP will require additional refinement in asset componentization, potentially altering the amount of depreciation expense recognized. While the Company is evaluating the proposal, it has not yet determined what effect it may have if passed by the FASB. However, the effect could be material. New Accounting Pronouncements and Change In Accounting Policy SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations was issued in 2001. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs. In conjunction with the group life method of accounting for asset costs, the Company historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. As noted above, with the adoption of SFAS 143 in fiscal year 2003, CSX recorded pretax income of $93 million, $57 million after tax as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, representing the reversal of the accrued liability for crosstie removal costs. The adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on prior reporting periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a material effect on future earnings. On an ongoing basis, depreciation expense will be reduced, while labor and fringe and materials, supplies and other expense will be increased by approximately $12 million annually. SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure was issued in December 2002. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition to Statement 123s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and require disclosure of the effects of an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation. Effective beginning with fiscal year 2003, CSX has voluntarily adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS 123. In accordance with the prospective method of 34 adoption permitted under SFAS 148, stock based awards issued subsequent to fiscal year 2002 are accounted for under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 utilizing the Black Scholes valuation method and, accordingly, are expensed. (See Note 15, Stock Plans.) In 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which requires a variable interest entity (VIE) to be consolidated by a company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns, or both. Interpretation No. 46 also requires disclosures about VIEs that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. Also in 2003, Interpretation 46 (46R), a revision to FASB Interpretation No. 46 was issued, to clarify some of the provisions of, and to exempt certain entities from Interpretation 46 requirements. Under the new guidance, CSX will consolidate Four Rivers Transportation, Inc. (FRT), a shortline railroad, into its financial statements at the beginning of fiscal 2004. Presently, FRT is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 will not have a material impact on results of operations in future reporting periods. In 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard Interpretation (FASI) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This statement requires that certain guarantees be recorded at fair value on the statement of financial position and additional disclosures be made about guarantees. CSX did not realize a financial statement impact with the adoption of the accounting provisions of this statement in fiscal year 2003 and does not anticipate a future impact. (See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies.) In 2001, SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, was issued. Under the provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. The Company adopted this standard for fiscal 2002, and incurred a pretax charge of $83 million, $43 million after tax and minority interest as a cumulative effect of an accounting change, which represents the difference between book value and the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets. These indefinite lived intangible assets are permits and licenses that the Company holds relating to a proposed pipeline to transfer natural gas from Alaskas North Slope to the port in Valdez, Alaska. The fair value was determined using a discount method of projected future cash flows relating to these assets. The carrying value of these assets is now approximately $3 million. The adoption of SFAS 142 did not have a material effect on prior reporting periods, and the Company does not believe it will have a material effect on future earnings. The Company does not have any other significant indefinite lived intangible assets. In 2002, SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, was issued. This statement requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis, and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur. In addition, this statement modifies the reporting requirements for discontinued operations. Long lived assets, whether to be held for disposition or held and used, should be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to dispose. The Company applied the provisions of this statement relating to the accounting for the conveyance of its wholly owned subsidiary, CSX Lines, to a third party in 2003 (See Note 3, Divestitures). In addition, another of the Companys subsidiaries, CSX World Terminals, was notified of a significant customer loss for 2004 and possible customer loss for 2005. Given these indicators, the Company evaluated the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by this terminal, whose long lived assets are recorded at $59 million and concluded that the forecasted future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the book value of its long lived assets, therefore no impairment write down is necessary at this time. 35 Regulation and Legislation Rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Railroad Administration of DOT and other state and regulatory agencies. The regulation and legislation passed by these organization can significantly affect the costs and profitability of the Companys business. In response to the heightened threat of terrorism in the wake of the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon and airline infrastructure, federal, state and local regulatory agencies are evaluating various proposals with respect to the transportation industry. Some of these proposals relate to the transport of hazardous material. Certain metropolitan areas considered at high risk for a terrorist attack may be the subject of future regulation. The ultimate legislation passed by federal, state and local regulators related to issues of security has the potential to severely affect CSXs operations and costs. Factors Expected to Influence 2004 During the upcoming year, there are several key areas which continue to affect the operations and profitability of CSX. Management believes that the Company must remain focused on improving the efficiency of its rail network, reducing its operating expense and restoring higher service levels. General economic factors, including the cost of fuel, may also influence 2004 operating results. Improving operating efficiency in Surface Transportation while maintaining volume is critical to success in lowering the operating ratio, and in turn improving financial performance. To do so, management believes that CSX must optimize its network routing, including a reduction in both gross ton miles and the number of times a car is handled or switched en route to the final destination. CSX is utilizing internal and external consultants to assist with the network optimization effort. Fuel represents a significant expense of CSX Surface Transportation operations and was a factor in 2003 expense increases. Fuel prices can vary significantly from period to period and significantly impact future results. Although CSX has implemented a fuel price hedging program, it will remain subject to fuel price fluctuations for the majority of 2004 fuel purchases. Approximately 18% of 2004 fuel purchases are currently hedged at an average cost of 70 cents per gallon, exclusive of taxes and transportation costs. Each month, the Company is systematically increasing its hedged amount so that in July of 2005, 76% of the estimated fuel purchases should be hedged for a 24 month period. CSX faces inherent business risk of exposure to property damage and personal injury claims in the event of train accidents, including derailments. The Company is also subject to exposure to occupational injury claims. While CSX is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company cannot ensure that it will not experience any material property damage, personal or occupational claims in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. Additionally, the Company cannot ensure that existing claims will not suffer adverse development not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors which are outside of CSXs control. CSX engages outside parties to assist with the evaluation of certain of the occupational and personal injury claims, and believes that it is adequately reserved to cover all potential claims. However, final amounts determined to be due to any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves. The ability of the Company to effectively implement the management restructuring will be an important factor in future success. Once complete, the organization of the Company should be conducive to enhanced accountability, faster, more reliable communication, better decision 36 making and a more competitive cost structure. Executing the restructuring while minimizing the impact of the possible disruption associated with the elimination of a significant portion of the Companys existing management will be critical to the Companys short term success. The ability of the Company to replace, in both the long and short term, the business lost due to competitive pressures in the Hong Kong terminals market will have a direct impact on the profitability of the Companys International Terminals segment. While management is diligently working to attract new customers, there can be no guarantee that new customers will be gained. Also, it is likely that the margins experienced in the past at the Companys Hong Kong terminal operations will not continue for the near term, even if the lost volume is replaced. The International Terminals segments revenue and operating income represented approximately 3% and 11% of the Companys consolidated revenues and operating income, respectively for 2003.
