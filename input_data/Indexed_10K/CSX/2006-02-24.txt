Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. 4 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties CSXs properties primarily consist of track and its related infrastructure, locomotives and freight cars and each category is described below. Track and Infrastructure Serving 23 states, the District of Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the CSXT rail network extends from New York, Philadelphia and Boston to the Southeast markets of Atlanta, Miami and New Orleans and to the Midwestern cities of East St. Louis, Memphis and Chicago. The Companys track structure includes main thoroughfares connecting terminals and yards (referred to as mainline track); track within terminals and switching yards; track adjacent to the mainlines used for passing trains; and track connecting the mainline track to customer locations. As of December 30, 2005, the breakdown of these track miles is as follows: Track Miles Mainline Track 26,865 Terminals and Switching Yards 9,774 Passing Sidings and Turnouts 1,031 Total 37,670 In addition to its physical track structure, CSXT operates 36 major yards and terminals, plus a number of smaller facilities. These sites serve as the links between the Company and its local customers and as sorting facilities where shipments are classified and routed to other areas around the nation. CSXTs train operations are focused around four major transportation networks: the Coal Network, the Southeastern Corridor, the Interstate 90 Corridor, and the Interstate 95 Corridor. Coal Network Coal is used to generate more than half of the electricity in the United States. The CSX coal network connects mining operations in nine states with industrial areas in the Northeast as well as many river, lake and seaport facilities. These routes also support CSXTs strong and growing utility market in the Southeast. Southeastern Corridor This section of the network runs on the western side of CSXTs system from Chicago and the Western gateways, through the cities of Atlanta, Nashville and Birmingham to markets throughout the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is a vital route for CSXTs merchandise and Intermodals traffic as well as automotive services. Interstate 90 (I 90) Corridor Chicago and metropolitan areas in New York and New England are linked by CSXs I 90 corridor. Much of this route has two lanes of track side by side (referred to as double mainline track) supporting high speed intermodal and automotive services. The I 90 corridor is also a primary route for import traffic moving across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. Interstate 95 (I 95) Corridor Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout the growing Southeast are connected to the heavily populated northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York 5 Table of Contents along CSXTs I 95 corridor. This route is used for certain CSX merchandise business, which primarily includes food and consumer products along with metals and chemicals. Locomotives CSXT operates more than 3,700 locomotives, of which approximately 500 are under short term lease arrangements. Freight locomotives are the power used primarily to pull trains. Switching locomotives are used in yards to sort rail cars so that the right rail car gets attached to the right train in order to get it to its final destination. Auxiliary units are typically used to provide extra traction for heavy trains in hilly terrain.

Open top hoppers handle heavy dry bulk commodities that are impervious to weather conditions such as coal, coke, stone, sand, ores and gravel. Flat Cars for shipping intermodal containers and trailers. Box Cars transport commodities that must be protected from the weather, such as paper products, appliances and building materials. Insulated boxcars deliver food products, canned goods, and certain beverages. Covered hoppers have a permanent roof. Lighter bulk commodities such as grain, fertilizer, flour, salt, sugar, clay and lime are shipped in large cars called jumbo covered hoppers. Heavier commodities like cement, ground limestone and glass sand are shipped in small cube covered hoppers. Other cars on the network include but are not limited to center beam cars for transporting lumber and building products.

Examples of these are railcars owned by other railroads, which are interchanged to CSXT; shipper furnished (private) cars, which are generally used only in that shippers services; and multi level railcars. These multi level railcars are used to transport finished motor vehicles, such as sport utility vehicles and light trucks in bi level cars, while sedans and smaller automobiles are shipped in try level cars. Multi level railcars are used jointly by participating railroads, and the fleet is managed as a nationwide pool to serve the automobile industry. As noted, in certain markets, CSXT uses railcars supplied by railroad customers. For example, chemical shippers typically supply tank cars for the transportation of hazardous and non hazardous material. The information set forth in Item 7.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 2005 Surface Transportation Highlights and Challenges Operating Results CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. This fiscal calendar allows every quarter to consistently end on a Friday and to be of equal duration (13 weeks). However, in order to maintain this type of reporting calendar, every sixth or seventh year (depending on the Gregorian calendar and when leap year falls), an extra week will be included in one quarter (a 14 week quarter) and, therefore, the full year will have 53 weeks. Fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks while fiscal year 2005 had 52 weeks. All comparisons below utilize these respective years reported results. Revenue Surface Transportations revenue in 2005 increased by 7% or $578 million to a record $8.6 billion while volume decreased by 2%, or 180,000 units. A portion of this volume decrease was due to the additional week included in fiscal year 2004. Revenue per unit increased by 10%, or $105, of which approximately 50% was due to continued pricing efforts and 50% was due to the Companys fuel surcharge program and traffic mix. Revenue increased across all commodities. A strong industrial economy, coupled with a shortage of rail, truck and barge capacity allowed for substantial price increases within all merchandise groups. While North American automotive production was relatively flat compared to the prior year, automotive revenue and revenue per unit benefited from contractual price escalations and higher fuel surcharges recoveries. Coal volumes and revenue improved significantly due to both increased electrical generation by CSXT served utilities and price increases. The overall competitive position of Intermodal improved compared to the trucking industry due to shortage of truck capacity and higher fuel prices creating a stronger pricing environment for Intermodal services. 14 Table of Contents A detailed discussion of significant factors driving changes in volume and revenue is provided under the caption, Results of Operations.

NM not meaningful Fuel Costs and Fuel Surcharge Program Fuel expenses increased 19% to $783 million in 2005, net of $249 million of fuel hedging benefits, due principally to the rising price per gallon of diesel fuel. Fuel hedging activity had a $63 million favorable impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel, including benefits from CSXs fuel hedging program, was $1.31 in 2005 versus $1.10 in 2004. Fuel cost recovery programs are commonly used within the transportation industry. When the cost of fuel exceeds certain thresholds, CSX shares a portion of the increase with its customers through its fuel surcharge program. In 2005, approximately 50% and 31% of CSXs revenue was subject to fuel surcharges and cost escalation clauses (which include a fuel element), respectively. As existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are executed, CSX is increasing the number of contracts which include fuel surcharge mechanisms. Operations As illustrated in the table below, key service measures show mixed results in 2005. Average train velocity, system dwell and recrew performance declined, while on time train originations improved compared to the prior year. Cars on line remained essentially flat, indicating that CSXTs network remained relatively fluid through 2005. The Companys Surface Transportation businesses remained focused on producing continuous improvement through several key initiatives. In 2004, CSXT instituted a new network operating plan called the ONE Plan, which defines CSXTs scheduled train network and is designed to improve service reliability and efficiency. Although anticipated benefits have not been realized on a sustained 15 Table of Contents basis, CSXT believes the ONE Plan benefits will be attained and remains committed to this initiative. Efforts are ongoing to improve plan execution and to refine the operating plan to reflect changing traffic volumes, operating capabilities, and service requirements. CSXT is investing to ensure that adequate resources are in place to achieve higher levels of plan execution. CSXT acquired 100 additional locomotives and started implementing a new locomotive plan in late 2005. Locomotive availability and reliability are critical to plan execution. CSXT also hired and trained approximately 2,000 train and engine employees to keep pace with high attrition rates, particularly conductors and engineers. Finally, a two year program to expand capacity in key corridors commenced in 2005. This expanded capacity will accommodate future growth, improve service reliability and improve efficiency on the targeted corridors. Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in late August, had a significant impact on operations in the latter part of 2005. Approximately 100 miles of CSXTs infrastructure was destroyed by the storm, effectively severing CSXTs route to and from the New Orleans gateway. CSXT continued service to customers outside of the storm affected area by rerouting rail traffic through alternative western gateways, including East St. Louis, IL, Memphis, TN, Birmingham, AL, Mobile, AL, and Montgomery, AL. Rerouted traffic added volume to busy corridors and resulted in additional network congestion, which adversely affected overall train velocity and system dwell. Service to local businesses on the Gulf Coast has been restored and previously rerouted Merchandise trains have returned to the New Orleans gateway. Operations should be normalized to pre hurricane conditions by the end of the first quarter of 2006. A description of the corresponding financial statement implications is presented below under the caption Hurricane Katrina.

(b) Beginning in October 2005, the American Association of Railroads adopted a new dwell calculation in an effort to standardize reporting across U.S. railroads. Beginning in 2006 and forward, CSX will adopt this new method. Safety CSXTs continued efforts to reduce the frequency of personal injuries and train accidents produced significant positive results in 2005. Continued focus on CSXTs safety leadership and train accident prevention processes produced improvements in both its FRA personal injury frequency index and FRA train accident frequency compared to 2004 results. Both processes use training, awareness, compliance measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work environment. 16 Table of Contents RAIL OPERATING STATISTICS(a) Fiscal Years Ended 2005 2004 % Change Service Measurements FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index (Per 200,000 Man Hours) 1.71 2.29 25 % FRA Train Accidents Frequency (Per Million Train Miles) 3.99 4.79 17 % (a) Amounts for 2005 are estimated.

See tables in Note 6. Hurricane Katrina As of December 30, 2005, The Company has collected insurance payments of $70 million. Through February 2006, the Company has collected an additional $50 million in insurance recoveries for a total of $120 million. Capital Investments Surface Transportation capital expenditures totaled $1.1 billion and $960 million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively. 2005 CSX Corporation Other Items International Terminals Disposal In February 2005, CSX sold its International Terminals business for net cash proceeds of $1,108 billion. CSX recognized a gain of $683 million pretax, $428 million after tax, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2005. (See Note 4. Discontinued Operations.) Debt Repurchase In June 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of its publicly traded notes. The consideration paid for these notes totaled $1.2 billion, including a pretax charge of $192 million for costs to repurchase the debt which primarily reflected the market value above original issue value. CSX used cash on hand to finance this repurchase. During 2005, CSX improved its overall financial position by reducing debt balances from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2004 to $6.0 billion as of December 30, 17 Table of Contents 2005. Corresponding interest expense benefits associated with lower outstanding debt helped offset rising variable interest rates. See Note 12. Debt and Credit Agreements. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G. Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating its financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings. Free cash flow is calculated by taking cash provided by operating activities less property additions, other investing activities, and dividends paid plus Conrail free cash flow and proceeds from sale of businesses. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles free cash flow (non GAAP measure) to cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure): Fiscal Years Ended December 30, December 31, 2005 2004 (Dollars in millions) Free Cash Flow(a) $ 1,030 $ 461 Add (Deduct) Items from Consolidated Cash Flow Statements: Short term Investments Net(b) 33 (247 ) Dividends Paid 93 86 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities(c) 36 1,240 Add (Deduct) Items Not Included in Consolidated Free Cash Flow: Conrail Free Cash Flow(d) (103 ) (115 ) Other Deposits(e) 21 21 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 1,110 $ 1,446 (a) Free cash flow as of December 30, 2005 includes net cash proceeds (net of taxes paid) from the International Terminals disposition of $640 million and net debt repurchase costs of $123 million. (b) Short term Investments Net represents the net source or (use) of cash resulting from sales and purchases of short term investments included in the investing section of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statements. (c) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities includes property additions offset by net cash proceeds (before taxes paid) from the International Terminals disposition of $998 million and other investing items. (d) Conrail Free Cash Flow represents CSXs 42% economic interest which is not consolidated in the CSX amounts. (e) Other Deposits are not included in the Companys Free Cash Flow as these deposits represent assets that are set aside for certain future debt payments. 2006 Expectations Revenue During 2006, CSX expects revenue growth, based in part on continuance of the robust pricing environment experienced in 2005. In addition, the Company expects volume increases of 2 3%. Longer term, CSX expects average annual revenue growth of 4 6% over the next five years due to 18 Table of Contents continued strong transportation demand, the Companys emphasis on price, and volume growth. Lower contributory traffic will continue to be re priced or replaced by longer haul, more profitable business. The amount of any revenue and volume increase will depend on several factors: Economy: Favorable economic conditions are expected to continue based on the forecasts for key economic indicators such as the gross domestic product, industrial production and overall import levels. Generally, the Companys revenue is fairly diversified and a large portion is relatively insensitive to significant fluctuations in the general economy. Changes, however, in the macroeconomic environment can impact overall revenue growth. Operational Performance: Service is expected to improve with more consistent execution of the network operating plan, which should result in improved average velocity and more reliable service. Consequently, additional volume may be captured as freight car availability increases due to improved asset utilization and reduced transit times. Fuel Prices: Because of the fuel surcharge program and cost escalation clauses in long term contracts, which include a fuel element, a portion of the Companys revenue varies with the price of fuel. In 2004, CSX suspended entering into new swaps in its fuel hedge program and fuel surcharges became the primary vehicle through which CSX manages fuel price volatility. Consequently, CSX anticipates increases in estimated fuel expenses to approach $100 million in 2006, depending on fluctuations in fuel prices. Operations CSXT expects key operating measurements to improve in 2006 versus the prior year as the initiatives mentioned previously gain momentum, and the emphasis on plan execution continues. Management believes current resource plans are adequate to handle anticipated business levels and to keep the network fluid. CSXT plans to hire approximately 1,860 new train and engine employees, which include locomotive engineers and conductors, to offset anticipated attrition. In addition, CSXT will acquire 100 new high horsepower locomotives in 2006. Planned capacity and infrastructure investments will also support improved service reliability and volume growth as they are completed throughout the year. Capital Investments The Company continues to invest in its rail infrastructure, locomotives, freight cars and technology to accommodate safe, efficient and reliable train operations. In anticipation of future volume growth in key corridors, the Company plans to make strategic infrastructure investments as profitability targets are met. Investments include locomotives mentioned previously, track and terminal infrastructure expansion such as the Southeastern corridor between Chicago and Florida and the River Line from Albany to New York City. Investments in the Southeastern corridor are intended, among other things, to support Western coal sourcing from the Colorado, Illinois and Powder River basins, consumer goods shipments from West Coast ports and merchandise and automobile shipments. Investments in the River Line are designed to increase long term capacity for the I 90 corridor between Chicago and New York. As a result of these investments and the ongoing needs of the business, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $1.4 billion in 2006 and between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in 2007, excluding the impact of Hurricane Katrina. Free Cash Flow CSX will continue to focus on free cash flow in 2006, with a target of approximately $300 million, including approximately $100 million in anticipated insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina. 19 Table of Contents Risk Factors Enterprise Risk Management In the provision of transportation services, the Company must identify, manage and mitigate the inherent business risks that are an integral component of the Companys business activities. Financial risk, legal, regulatory, and compliance issues, operational risk, and workforce planning are primary risks to the Companys business. In 2005, the Company began implementation of a formal Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program in order to identify, quantify, monitor, and potentially mitigate these risks. ERM is a systematic and ongoing process used to help recognize and manage the critical risks that could impact the Company. ERM assists managements allocation of financial resources and mitigation efforts and enhances risk oversight by the Board of Directors with oversight by the Board or Board Committees, management is responsible for the development and implementation of risk mitigation policies and directing day to day risk management. The following important risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Companys forward looking statements. Competition The Company experiences competition in the form of pricing, service, reliability and other factors from other transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area, and to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Transportation providers such as motor carriers and barges utilize public rights of way that are built and maintained by governmental entities while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks using largely internal resources. The Company could be negatively impacted if the scope and quality of these alternative methods of transportation materially increase, or if legislation is passed providing materially greater opportunities for motor carriers with respect to size or weight restrictions. Operations and Workforce Planning In an environment of continued high demand for rail services, CSXT has experienced some network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity on its rail system. In addition, changes in demographics, training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel, could each have a negative impact on CSXTs ability to meet demand for rail service. To meet these challenges, CSXT started implementation of the new network operating plan referred to as the ONE Plan, acquired additional locomotives, started implementing a new locomotive plan, and is hiring and training significant numbers of employees to keep pace with high attrition rates. In 2005, the Company also commenced a two year program to expand capacity in key corridors. Though these steps have been taken, CSXT cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address the operational issues. The Company also cannot be sure that it will not experience other difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned increases in demand for rail service in one or more of our commodity groups, or other events that could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Employees and Labor Union Relationships CSXT considers relations with its unions and union employees generally to be good. Most of CSXTs employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The bargaining agreements contain a moratorium clause that precludes serving new bargaining demands until a certain date. Generally speaking, these agreements are bargained nationally by the National Railway Labor Conference, so all bargaining on agreement changes 20 Table of Contents begins at the same time. The round of bargaining that started in 2000 was recently concluded when agreements were reached with all of the unions. Most of the moratoriums negotiated in the 2000 round have expired and in November 2004 the parties were free under the collective bargaining agreements to serve new bargaining demands and start a new round of national bargaining. The current status of 2004 negotiations is that CSXT and the other railroads participating in national bargaining are in mediation with eight unions, are bargaining with four other unions and have not started bargaining with one union. The railroads had asked the National Mediation Board for a release from mediation with respect to seven of the eight unions in mediation, but now have informed the National Mediation Board that they are voluntarily withdrawing that request pending a decision in the lawsuit brought by the United Transportation Union which challenges certain aspects of the railroads bargaining demands. The outcome of the 2004 round of negotiations is uncertain at this time. In the rail industry, negotiations have generally taken place over a number of years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. The agreements reached in the 2000 round of bargaining will continue to remain in effect until new agreements are reached. The parties are not permitted to either strike or lockout until the Railway Labor Acts lengthy procedures (which include mediation, cooling off periods, and the possibility of Presidential intervention) are exhausted. Environmental Laws and Regulation The Companys operations are subject to wide ranging federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to water, the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials, and cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases. The Company generates and transports hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials in its current operations, and it has done so in its former operations. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third parties in toxic tort litigation. The Company has been and may be subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Companys incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long term liabilities for known future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination. Fuel Costs Fuel costs represent a significant expense of the Companys Surface Transportation operations. Fuel prices can vary significantly from period to period and significant increases may have a material adverse effect on results of operations. Furthermore, fuel prices and supply are influenced considerably by international political and economic circumstances. A fuel surcharge recovery program is in place with a considerable number of customers. This program has historically permitted the Companys Surface Transportation businesses to recover a significant portion of increased fuel costs. Despite the fuel surcharge program, the Company could be negatively impacted if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, whether due to OPEC or other production restrictions, lower refinery outputs, a disruption of oil imports or otherwise, and any subsequent price increases could further increase the potential impact. 21 Table of Contents Future Acts of Terrorism or War Terrorist attacks, such as those that occurred in the United States in September 2001, in Spain in March 2004, or in England in July 2005, and any government response thereto or war may adversely affect results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The Companys rail lines and physical plant may be direct targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war, which could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues and have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically or the coverage may no longer be available. Regulation and Legislation The Company is subject to various regulatory jurisdictions, including the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Railroad Administration of DOT and other state and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal and other matters. Legislation passed by Congress or regulations issued by these agencies can significantly affect the revenues, costs and profitability of the Companys business. Moreover, the Company could be negatively affected by failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Congressional efforts to reduce or eliminate funding for Amtrak, if successful, could result in significant costs to CSXT, including, but not limited to: loss of revenue from trackage rights; uncertainty relating to operating agreements; loss of other contractual rights, such as indemnification; adverse network implications, such as potential coordination with numerous state commuter rail agencies; and increased payments into the Railroad Retirement system to supplement lost contributions from Amtrak and its employees. In response to the heightened threat of terrorism in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and beginning to adopt various legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry, including rules and regulations that affect the transportation of hazardous materials. For instance, the District of Columbia enacted legislation that prohibits rail carriers, including CSXT, from transporting certain hazardous materials through the District. CSXT, supported by the United States, is currently challenging the validity of this legislation in the federal courts. Although CSXT and the Federal Government have secured favorable rulings from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the STB, legal proceedings continue, and the ultimate outcome is uncertain. The extent to which other governmental bodies will ultimately take similar or related steps is also uncertain. The Company could be negatively impacted by any legislation, regulations, or rules enacted by federal, state or local governmental bodies relating to security issues that affect rail and intermodal transportation. Safety The Company faces inherent business risk from exposure to property damage and personal injury claims resulting from train accidents, including derailments. The Company is also subject to exposure to occupational injury claims. While the Company is working diligently to enhance its safety programs and to continue to raise the awareness levels of its employees concerning safety, the Company cannot ensure that it will not experience any material property damage or personal injury or occupational claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. Additionally, the Company cannot ensure that existing claims will not suffer adverse development not currently reflected in reserve estimates, as the ultimate outcome of existing claims is subject to numerous factors outside of the Companys control. The Company engages outside parties to assist with the evaluation of certain of the occupational and personal injury claims, and believes that it is adequately reserved to cover all potential claims. Final amounts determined to be due, however, on any outstanding matters may differ materially from the recorded reserves. 22 Table of Contents Severe Weather The Company may face severe weather conditions and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes which may cause significant disruptions to the Companys operations, and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. For information on insurance issues resulting from the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the Companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see Note 6. Hurricane Katrina. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the SEC, as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Financial Results of Operations 2005 vs. 2004 Consolidated Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal year 2005 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 30, 2005. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks ending on December 31, 2004.

NM not meaningful 24 Table of Contents Operating Revenue Operating Revenue increased $578 million for the year ended December 30, 2005 to $8.6 billion, compared to $8.0 billion for the prior year as continued yield management efforts coupled with the Companys fuel surcharge program drove revenue per unit improvements across all major markets. Operating Income Operating Income for the year ended December 30, 2005 increased $550 million to $1.6 billion as a result of increased operating revenue. Operating expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Other Income Despite the absence of the $16 million net gain after tax related to the Conrail spin off transaction, Other Income increased $29 million to $101 million for the year ended December 30, 2005, primarily as a result of gains from real estate sales. Interest Expense Interest Expense decreased $12 million to $423 million for the year ended December 30, 2005 compared to the prior year comparable period. In June 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of its publicly traded notes. As a result of the debt repurchase, interest expense was reduced. The savings (from June through December) were mostly offset by rising variable interest rates. Net Earnings Earnings from Continuing Operations were $720 million, or $3.17 per diluted share, for the year ended December 30, 2005 compared to $418 million, or $1.87 per diluted share for the prior year. Income tax expense increased $97 million to $316 million for the year ended December 30, 2005 as a result of higher Earnings from Continuing Operations. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased from 34% in 2004 to 30% in 2005 primarily attributable to legislative changes in Ohio that will gradually eliminate the Ohio corporate franchise tax. Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, was $425 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 30, 2005 compared to a loss of $79 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, for the prior year. CSX recognized income of $683 million pretax, $428 million after tax, for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2005 as a result of the sale of its International Terminals business. Discontinued Operations for the period ended December 31, 2004, includes International Terminals net earnings as well as additional income tax expense of $97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings. Net Earnings were $1.1 billion, or $5.04 per diluted share, for the year ended December 30, 2005, compared to $339 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, for the prior year. 25 Table of Contents 2004 vs. 2003 Consolidated Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.

NM not meaningful Operating Revenue Operating Revenue increased $467 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $8.0 billion, compared to $7.6 billion for the prior year primarily due to continued yield management strategies as all major markets showed year over year improvement in revenue per unit coupled with the Companys fuel surcharge program. Operating Income Operating Income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $480 million to $1.0 billion, compared to $520 million in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased principally due to the absence of charges totaling $340 million taken in 2003 for (1) the Provision for Casualty Claims, and (2) the Additional Loss on Sale. Other Income Other Income decreased $21 million to $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $93 million for the prior year primarily due to a decline in income from real estate and resort operations. This decrease was partially offset by the net gain of $16 million, after tax, related to the Conrail spin off transaction. 26 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest Expense increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the prior year comparable period due to decreased benefits from interest rate swaps and the exchange of Conrail debt as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction. Net Earnings Earnings from Continuing Operations were $418 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $137 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, for the prior year. Losses from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, were $79 million, or 35 cents per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to earnings of $52 million, or 23 cents per diluted share, for the prior year. Discontinued Operations for the period ended December 31, 2004, include International Terminals net earnings as well as additional tax expense of $97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings. The year ended December 26, 2003 includes an after tax cumulative effect of accounting change benefit of $57 million, related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). Net Earnings were $339 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $246 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, for the prior year. The increase in the 2004 effective income tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to a larger percentage of total pretax earnings being attributable to Conrail equity earnings in 2004 than in 2003. Additionally, 2003 income tax expense was favorably impacted by the cumulative effect of changes in the Companys deferred effective state income tax rates. 2005 vs. 2004 Rail Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.

Operating Revenue CSX categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business: merchandise, automotive and coal, coke and iron ore. Overall revenue increased $562 million, or 8%, to $7.3 billion in 2005 from $6.7 billion in 2004. Merchandise All merchandise markets experienced revenue growth primarily driven by yield improvement efforts and the Companys fuel surcharge program. Overall merchandise revenue grew 6% to a record $4.2 billion while revenue per unit also achieved record levels increasing 9%. Volume declined 3% due to several factors including an additional week included in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, impacts of Hurricane Katrina and shedding of low margin traffic. Food and consumer experienced volume growth due to a continued shift of traffic previously handled by trucks to rail and the acquisition of newly finished railcars to other shippers. Despite strong soybean and corn harvests and increased export demand for grain, volume in agricultural products was flat due to declines in processed products such as flour, sweeteners, and vegetable oils. Emerging markets volumes and revenue were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in shipments of high revenue per unit military traffic. While metals volumes decreased by 5%, the pricing environment remained very favorable and resulted in the highest revenue per unit growth within merchandise at 17%. Forest products also experienced high revenue per unit increases because of both a favorable pricing environment and a favorable mix shift from short haul low margin traffic towards longer haul more profitable traffic. In addition to production disruption from both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, chemical volumes were negatively impacted by high natural gas prices and generally high raw materials inventories. Phosphate and fertilizer volumes were down due to high international inventories of phosphates during the first half of the year and several CSX served plant curtailments 28 Table of Contents or closures during 2005. Both the chemicals and phosphate and fertilizer groups experienced high revenue per unit increases of 8% and 9%, respectively. Automotive Overall volume was down 4% as North American light vehicle production was flat compared to the prior year. However, vehicle production for the Big 3 was unfavorable 6%, including permanent closures of three General Motors plants served by the Company. Growth in new shipments from the newly opened Hyundai plant in Montgomery, AL continued to partially offset these declines. Revenue per unit grew 5% on strong yield management and increases in fuel surcharge rates and coverage resulting in record revenue per unit levels. Revenue per unit gains more than offset volume weakness and drove overall revenue growth of 1% compared to the prior year. Coal, Coke & Iron Ore Revenues increased by 17% to a record $2.1 billion due to both strong volume growth of 5%, and revenue per unit improvements of 12% driven by a favorable pricing environment and the Companys fuel surcharge program. Most markets experienced strong demand as utility inventory levels remained below target levels. CSXT also reached a settlement agreement in a rate case that resulted in an additional $17 million of revenue in 2005. Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses increased $102 million, or 2% for the year ended December 30, 2005, compared to 2004. Labor and Fringe Expense increased $114 million or 4% compared to the prior year primarily attributable to increases in incentive compensation and the effects of inflation. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses increased $82 million, or 5%, primarily due to the effects of inflation, higher reserve requirements for uncollectible accounts, and increased legal fees resulting from the litigation and resolution of certain matters. Depreciation expense increased $115 million or 17% compared to the prior year primarily attributable to additional assets received as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction. The rail segment had property additions of approximately $1.1 billion. Fuel expense increased $127 million or 19% in 2005, net of $249 million of fuel hedging benefits, compared to the prior year primarily due to fuel price increases. Fuel hedging activity had a $63 million favorable impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel, including benefits from CSXs fuel hedging program, was $1.31 in 2005 versus $1.10 in 2004. In addition, the fuel surcharge programs and contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multi year customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases. Building and Equipment Rent decreased $28 million or 7% in 2005, compared to the prior year, as a result of decreased overall volume and lower locomotive lease expense. Inland transportation, which represents Intermodals use of the CSXT rail network, decreased $12 million compared to the prior year. The offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in Intermodals operating expense, and is thus eliminated at the consolidated level. Conrail Rents, Fees & Services expense decreased $191 million or 75% in 2005, compared to the prior year, as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction, which decreased rents paid to Conrail as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSXT. Additionally, Conrail received a tax benefit from the resolution of various federal income tax audit adjustments during 2005, which increases CSXs equity earnings and offsets Conrail Rents, Fees & Services. (See Note 2. Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail.) 29 Table of Contents Rail operating expense for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2005, included net favorable reserve adjustments of $38 million related to decreasing claim trends. This adjustment is reflected as Provision for Casualty Claims in the operating expense detail above. (See Note 11. Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves.) For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, the rail business segment recorded expense of $67 million for separation expense, pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges, stock compensation expense and other related expenses. (See Note 5. Management Restructuring.) Operating Income Operating income increased $460 million to $1.3 billion in 2005, compared to $841 million in 2004 primarily due to an 8% increase in revenue. 2004 vs. 2003 Rail Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks ending on December 31, 2004. Fiscal year 2003 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003.

Operating Revenue CSXT categorizes revenues in three main areas: merchandise, automotive and coal, coke and iron ore. Overall revenues were up $512 million to $6.7 billion in 2004 from $6.2 billion in 2003. Merchandise Merchandise showed strength during 2004 with revenue up 8% on 3% volume growth. All markets showed year over year revenue improvement due to pricing, yield management strategies and the Companys fuel surcharge program. All markets, except agricultural products, experienced increased volumes. Metals realized the most improvement, with 17% revenue growth on 9% volume growth. Strong demand existed across all steel commodity lines as steel production and mill utilization rates were at high levels. Forest products revenue grew 9% on 1% volume growth as a result of strength in panel and lumber markets driven by strong residential construction. Food and consumer revenues grew 7% on 1% volume growth. Food and consumer and forest products volumes were favorable year over year primarily due to the 53 week fiscal reporting calendar in 2004. Chemicals revenue grew 8% on 4% volume growth driven by strong customer demand and a rebound in U.S. chemical exports. Emerging markets revenues grew 7% on 6% volume growth, largely driven by strength in aggregates, cement, lime and fly ash. New industrial development is helping serve off rail markets. Phosphate and fertilizer revenues grew 4% on 2% volume growth. Fertilizer production levels were mixed as high fertilizer prices and hurricane disruptions caused curtailments in production. Although ethanol shipments contributed to growth in agricultural products, revenue increased 3% on declining volume due to a decline in export and bean markets. 31 Table of Contents Automotive Volumes declined largely due to a 100,000 unit year over year decrease in North American light vehicle production. Downtime at CSXT served plants also contributed to volume weakness. Price increases drove improvements in revenue per unit. Coal, Coke and Iron Ore Coal, coke and iron ore revenue increased 11% on 6% volume growth. All lines of business reflect year over year revenue per unit improvements. Volume growth was driven by gains in export, metallurgical and utility markets. Strength in exports was due to high demand primarily related to Asian steel market needs. Other Other revenue for the fiscal year 2004 includes $63 million for FRT, a short line railroad consolidated in 2004 pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Prior to 2004, FRT was accounted for under the equity method. Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses increased $212 million, or 4% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to 2003. Labor and Fringe Expense increased $141 million or 6% compared to the prior year primarily attributable to the effects of inflation, consolidation of FRT and increases in incentive compensation plan and pension costs. These costs were partially offset by benefits realized from reduced staffing levels. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses increased $182 million, or 13%, year over year primarily due to increased maintenance and crew travel costs, property and sales taxes, coupled with higher track, locomotive, car repair and other costs. Additionally, due to the adoption of SFAS 143 as discussed below, depreciation expense has been decreased and materials, supplies and other expense increased to account for the discontinuance of the accrual of cross tie removal as a component of depreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased $85 million or 15% compared to the prior year primarily attributable to assets received as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction. The rail segment had property additions of approximately $1 billion, but the additional depreciation was offset by the reduction in depreciation associated with the adoption of SFAS 143. In conjunction with the group life method of accounting for asset costs, CSXT historically accrued crosstie removal costs as a component of depreciation, which is not permitted under SFAS 143. The effect is to decrease depreciation expense and increase Materials, Supplies and Other expense. Fuel expense increased $90 million or 16% in 2004, net of $63 million of fuel hedging benefits, compared to the prior year primarily due to fuel price increases, while increased volumes were also a factor. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel, including benefits from CSXs fuel hedging program, was $1.10 in 2004 versus $0.96 in 2003. In addition, the fuel surcharge programs and contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multi year customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases. Building and Equipment Rent remained relatively consistent year over year with the slight increase in 2004 resulting from unfavorable asset utilization. Inland transportation, which represents Intermodals use of the CSXT rail network, reduced operating expense by $22 million or 6% year over year. The offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in Intermodals operating expense, and thus eliminates at the consolidated level. 32 Table of Contents Conrail Rents, Fees & Services expense decreased $86 million or 25% in 2004, compared to the prior year, as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction, which decreased rents paid to Conrail as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSXT. (See Note 2. Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail.) For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, the rail business segment recorded expense of $67 million for separation expense, pension and postretirement benefit curtailment charges, stock compensation expense and other related expenses. (See Note 5. Management Restructuring.) Rail operating expense for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2003, included a charge of $229 million recorded in conjunction with CSXTs change in estimate for its casualty reserves to include an estimate of incurred but not reported claims for asbestos and other occupational injuries that could be received over the next seven years. This charge is reflected as Provision for Casualty Claims in the operating expense detail above. (See Note 11. Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves.) Operating Income Operating income increased $300 million to $841 million in 2004, compared to $541 million in 2003 primarily due to an 8% increase in revenue coupled with the absence of $229 million provision for casualty claims, offset by $67 million of management restructuring charges and other expense increases as previously discussed. 2005 vs. 2004 Intermodal Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal year 2005 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 30, 2005. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks ending on December 31, 2004.

Operating Revenue Intermodal revenue improved 1% due to higher fuel surcharge rates, customer coverage and continued emphasis on multiple ancillary charges, including premise use and per diem charges related to asset utilization. In the domestic market, continued focus on longer hauls in higher density lanes coupled with sustained strength in pricing increased revenue per unit by 7%. Overall, domestic volumes were down compared to the prior year due to ongoing yield management efforts. Strong demand from the parcel sector partially offset volume declines and increased revenue. International volumes and revenue remained flat compared to the prior year. Pricing initiatives were offset by a reduction in long haul shipments from the west coast. The shift of traffic to east coast ports caused an increase in shorter haul moves, which negatively impacted revenue per unit. Operating Expense Intermodal expenses decreased 7% compared to the prior year due to continued service improvements, an emphasis on equipment utilization, and decrease in volume as discussed above. A decline in trucking expenses associated with line haul moves led to a significant decrease in operating costs associated with a reduction in services. Several productivity initiatives within terminal operations generated efficiencies driving per unit cost reductions compared to the prior year. 34 Table of Contents 2004 vs. 2003 Intermodal Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks ending on December 31, 2004. Fiscal year 2003 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 26, 2003.

Operating Revenue Intermodal revenue improved 6% on a 3% volume increase due to strength in most business commodities. Strong gains in truck brokerage continued with the implementation of deal space technology, which is incorporated into the broader Pegasus system. Deal space technology is designed as a pricing, scheduling and capacity reservation system and provides CSX Trucking solicitors real time information on costs, competitive prices, preferred routes and service. The parcel and international sectors also continued to show year over year strength. The parcel group showed improvement in most markets while international volume gains were based on general import growth. The domestic channel did not experience year over year growth due to Intermodals Network Simplification Initiative which led to overall service improvements across the network, limited some terminals to containers only and improved the profitability of the traffic. 35 Table of Contents Operating Expense Intermodal operating expense increased $40 million compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in volume and inflationary factors. Operating income increased to $152 million in 2004, compared to $110 million in the prior year, a 38% improvement. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased $213 million to $309 million at December 30, 2005, from $522 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in cash is primarily due to the net effect of total consolidated debt repaid of $1.3 billion (see Debt Repurchase below) offset by the net cash proceeds from the sale of CSXs International Terminals business of $1.1 billion. Debt Repurchase In June 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of its publicly traded notes. The total consideration paid for these notes totaled $1.2 billion, which includes a pretax charge of $192 million for costs to repurchase the debt which primarily reflects the market value above original issue value. CSX used cash proceeds from the disposition of CSXs International Terminals business to finance this repurchase. During 2005, CSX improved its overall financial position by reducing debt balances from $7.2 billion at December 31, 2004 to $6.0 billion as of December 30, 2005. As a result of the debt repurchase, CSX expects interest expense savings of approximately $68 million per year. However, these savings will be offset by rising short term interest rates associated with $1.1 billion of variable rate debt which terms are based on LIBOR. (See Note 12. Debt and Credit Agreements.) Convertible Debentures In October 2005, holders had the option to require CSX to purchase their debentures at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of $852.48 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. As a result, CSX purchased an immaterial aggregate principal amount at maturity of the debentures with cash on hand. The debentures allow holders to require CSX to purchase their debentures in October 2006, October 2008, October 2011, and October 2016, at a purchase price equal to the accreted value of the debentures at the time. The debentures are classified in Current Maturities of Long term Debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Issuances In August 2004, CSX issued $300 million of floating rate notes with a maturity date of August 3, 2006. The notes bear interest at a rate that varies with LIBOR plus an applicable spread. These notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. Operating Activities Cash provided by operations in 2005 was $1.1 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for 2004. Earnings from Continuing Operations were substantially higher than the previous year. However, the Company made significant tax payments attributable to these higher earnings as well as related taxes paid on the sale of CSXs International Terminals business in 2005. Investing Activities Net cash used by investing activities was $36 million in 2005 compared to $1.2 billion in 2004. Included in investing activities is cash spent for capital additions of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in 2005 and 2004 respectively. Offsetting the cash spent in 2005, are the net cash proceeds from the disposition of CSXs International Terminals business. 36 Table of Contents Financing Activities Financing activities used cash of $1.3 billion during 2005 compared to providing cash of $20 million during 2004 primarily as a result of the debt repurchase completed in June 2005, and an increase in dividends paid, which was partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Dividends CSX paid $93 million, $86 million, and $86 million in dividends in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in 2005 is a result of the Company increasing dividends by 30%, in the fourth quarter, from 10 cents to 13 cents per share. Working Capital The Companys working capital at December 30, 2005 was a deficit of $607 million, compared to a deficit of $314 million at December 31, 2004, primarily driven by reductions in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments combined with the absence of net assets from CSXs former International Terminals business. A working capital deficit is not unusual for the Company and other railroads and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due and has sufficient financial capacity to manage its day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations arising from legal, tax and other regulatory rulings. Credit Facilities CSX has a $1.2 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in May 2009 and a $400 million 364 day unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in May 2006. The facilities were entered into in May 2004 and May 2005, respectively, on terms substantially similar to the facilities they replaced. Generally, these facilities may be used for general corporate purposes, to support CSXs commercial paper, and for working capital. Neither of the credit facilities was drawn on as of December 30, 2005. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facilities are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated investment grade borrowers. In 2005, CSX paid approximately $2 million for total fees associated with the undrawn facility. These credit facilities allow for borrowings at floating (LIBOR based) rates, plus a spread, depending upon CSXs senior unsecured debt ratings. At December 30, 2005, CSX was in compliance with all covenant requirements under the facilities. Stock Repurchases The Board of Directors has authorized CSX to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time in an amount up to approximately $150 million in any fiscal year. Pursuant to this authority, CSX intends to purchase shares of CSX common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Credit Ratings As of December 30, 2005, CSXs long term unsecured debt obligations were rated BBB and Baa2 by Standard and Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. In May 2005, Standard and Poors raised CSXs short term rating from A 3 to A 2 and revised the outlook from negative to stable. In July 2004, Moodys Investor Service reaffirmed CSXs short and long term unsecured debt ratings, but adjusted the outlook from stable to negative. CSXs short term commercial paper program is rated A 2 and P 2 by Standard and Poors and Moodys Investor Service, respectively. If CSXs long term unsecured bond ratings were reduced to BBB and Baa3, its undrawn borrowing costs under the $1.2 billion and $400 million revolving credit facilities would not materially increase. If CSXs short term commercial paper ratings were reduced to A 3 and P 3, it would increase CSXs 37 Table of Contents borrowing costs in the commercial paper market and reduce its access to this source of funds because of the more limited demand for lower rated commercial paper. CSX had no commercial paper outstanding at December 30, 2005 or December 31, 2004. Shelf Registration Statements CSX currently has $900 million of capacity under an effective shelf registration that may be used, subject to market conditions and board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSXs discretion. CSX presently intends to use the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under its shelf registration statement to finance cash requirements, including refinancing existing debt as it matures. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting such needs, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. Schedule of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table sets forth maturities of the Companys contractual obligations: Type of Obligation 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (Dollars in millions)(Unaudited) Long term Debt (See Note 12) $ 1,016 $ 595 $ 633 $ 296 $ 94 $ 3,474 $ 6,108 Operating Leases Net (See Note 19) 176 165 120 87 75 264 956 Agreements with Conrail (See Note 2) 18 18 16 13 9 17 91 Purchase Obligations (See Note 19) 397 423 342 338 353 5,855 7,708 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,607 $ 1,201 $ 1,111 $ 734 $ 531 $ 9,610 $ 14,863 The following table sets forth maturities of the Companys other commitments: Type of Obligation 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total (Dollars in millions)(Unaudited) Unused Lines of Credit (See Note 12) $ 400 $ $ $ 1,200 $ $ $ 1,600 Guarantees (See Note 19) 21 22 16 16 16 26 117 Other 43 15 1 1 60 Total Other Commitments $ 464 $ 37 $ 16 $ 1,217 $ 16 $ 27 $ 1,777 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements There are no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail See background, accounting and financial reporting effects and summary financial information in Note 2. Investment In and Integrated Rail Operations with Conrail. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting 38 Table of Contents period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Accounting Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group Life Method Income Taxes These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves Casualty Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims. Currently, none of these claims are covered by insurance since no individual claim value is expected to exceed the Companys self insured retention amount. Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). To the extent the value of an individual claim were to exceed the self insured retention amount, CSX would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. Most of the claims are related to CSXT unless otherwise noted. Personal Injury CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of CSXTs claims and cases. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of CSXTs personal injury claims. This methodology is based largely on CSXTs historical claims and settlement activity. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments, and uncertainties in litigation. While the final outcome of casualty related matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other things, the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. However, should a number of these items occur in the same period, they could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year. Occupational Occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place, such as asbestos, solvents, and diesel fuel, or alleged physical injuries, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss. Occupational Asbestos The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were phased out in the 1950s, according to rail industry statistics. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985. 39 Table of Contents Asbestos claim filings against the Company have been inconsistent. Accordingly, while the Company had concluded that a probable loss had occurred, prior to 2003 it did not believe it could estimate the range of reasonably possible loss because of the lack of experience with such claims and the lack of detailed employment records for the population of exposed employees. Claim filings increased and when they continued into 2003, the Company concluded that an estimate for incurred but not reported (IBNR) asbestos exposure liability needed to be recorded. Currently, there is recurring pending legislation regarding the establishment of an asbestos liability trust fund. The impact to the Company of this pending legislation is unknown at this time. 2003 Provision for Asbestos Change in Estimate In 2003, the Company changed its estimate of asbestos reserves to include an estimate of IBNR claims and retained a third party specialist who has extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist in this estimate. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi annually and is reviewed by management. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated IBNR claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty. The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, first determined its potentially exposed population from which it was able to derive the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim was then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Based on the assessment, in September 2003 the Company recorded an undiscounted $141 million pre tax charge for unasserted asbestos claims. Key elements of the assessment included the following: An estimate was computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national employment for select years during the period 1938 2001. The Company used railroad industry historical census data because it did not have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees. The projected incidence of disease was estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees age and the duration and intensity of potential exposure while employed. An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease (non malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) was computed using the Companys average historical claim filing rates for a 2 year calibration period (i.e. the years management felt were representative of future filing rates). An estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim was computed using the Companys historical average dismissal rates observed for two years. An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease was computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of incident observed during a 3 year time period. From these assumptions, the Company projected the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates were applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represent claims that are closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Companys future liability for IBNR asbestos claims. Asbestos claim filings are typically sporadic and may include large batches of claims solicited by law firms. To reflect these factors, CSX used a 2 year calibration period during its initial assessment 40 Table of Contents because the Company believed it would be most representative of its future claim experience. In addition, for non malignant claims, the number of future claims to be filed against CSX declines at a rate consistent with both mortality and age as there is a decreasing probability of filing claims as the population ages. CSX believes the average claim values by type of disease from the historical 2 year period were most representative of future claim values. 2005 Provision for Asbestos Change in Estimate In 2004, management had no changes in estimate for asbestos liabilities. In 2005, management updated their assessment of the unasserted liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists, which resulted in recognition of a $48 million favorable change in estimate associated with asbestos liabilities. During 2004 and 2005, asbestos related disease claims filed against CSX dropped substantially, particularly bulk claims filed by certain law firms. In 2003, the Company received a significant number of filings. The Company believes the number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new, more restrictive venue law took effect in West Virginia in mid 2003. As a result, management reassessed the calibration period to a 3 year average, excluding the surge in claims originating in West Virginia. Management believes this calibration period provides the best estimate of future filing rates. The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 10% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $7 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims. The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, obtains semi annual updates of the study. The Company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments. More periodic updates to the study will occur if trends necessitate a change. Other Occupational 2003 Provision for Other Occupational Change in Estimate In 2003, the Company changed its estimate of occupational reserves to include an estimate of IBNR claims for other occupational injuries as well as asbestos as noted above. The Company engaged a third party specialist to assist in projecting the number of other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years. Based on this analysis, the Company established reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable other occupational injury liabilities. In 2003, the Company recorded an undiscounted $65 million pre tax charge for IBNR other occupational claims for similar reasons as asbestos discussed above. Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment included the following: An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational diseases was calculated by projecting active versus retired work force from 2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003 report. An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee was computed using the Companys average historical claim filing rates for the 2 year calibration period for all diseases except hearing loss. Because the filing rate for hearing loss claims has been decreasing since 1998, the latest year filing rate was viewed as representative. These calibration periods are the time periods which management felt were representative of future filing rates. An estimate was made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired CSX population each year. 41 Table of Contents An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury was computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of injury observed during a 3 year time period. 2005 Provision for Other Occupational Change in Estimate In 2004, management had no changes in estimate for other occupational liabilities. During 2005, CSX experienced an unfavorable trend in settlement values for repetitive stress and other injuries, which resulted in the recognition of a $10 million unfavorable change in estimate associated with these liabilities. In connection with the semi annual updates of the study, the Company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments. More periodic updates to the study will occur if trends necessitate a change. The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 10% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $7 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims. Summary The amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos and other occupational liabilities are based upon currently known information and judgments based upon that information. Projecting future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational litigation or legislation in the United States, could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected. While the final outcome of casualty related matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other items the meritorious legal defenses available and the liabilities that have been recorded, it is the opinion of management that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or liquidity. However, should a number of these items occur in the same period, they could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year. Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies related to environmental issues. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 259 environmentally impaired sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. A number of these proceedings are based on allegations that CSX, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to the facilities in question for disposal. In addition, some of the Companys land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in releases of various regulated materials onto the property. Therefore, the Company is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions under the Superfund law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, which could be substantial. In 2004, the Company assumed $6 million of Conrail environmental liabilities, due to the Conrail spin off transaction. 42 Table of Contents At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role with respect to each such location, giving consideration to a number of factors, including: Type of cleanup required; Nature of CSXTs alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site, or owner or operator of the site); Extent of CSXTs alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); Accuracy and strength of evidence connecting CSXT to the location; and Number, connection, and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRPs at the location. CSXT management estimates its environmental liabilities using guidance from Statement of Position (SOP) 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. Each site is periodically evaluated and the liability is adjusted to the most recent estimates made by management. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded reserves to cover estimated contingent future environmental costs with respect to such sites. Environmental costs are charged to expense when they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the Companys estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for all sites where the Companys obligation is (1) deemed probable, and (2) where such costs can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Legal In accordance with SFAS 5, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is (1) probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities twice quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards. Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans, principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. In addition to the defined benefit pension 43 Table of Contents plans, the Company sponsors one medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full time, salaried, management employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. The postretirement medical plans are contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non contributory. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), and SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions (SFAS 106). Both of these statements require that management make certain assumptions relating to the following: Long term rate of return of plan assets; Discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense; Salary scale inflation rates; Health care cost trend rates; and Other assumptions. These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and postretirement plans as it provides for more timely analysis. The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects as of the beginning of the plan year. The Company reviews the discount, salary scale inflation, and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. Because the Company reduced its expected long term rate of return on assets in 2004, management does not anticipate revising this assumption for the next several years to maintain consistency with market cycles. Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment. The expected long term rate of return on plan assets is used in conjunction with the market related value of assets to compute the expected return on assets. The Companys expected long term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and postretirement expense. Assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which the pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled. It is appropriate in estimating those rates to look to available information about rates implicit in current prices of annuity contracts that could be used to effect settlement of the obligation. In making those estimates, employers may also look to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the 44 Table of Contents plans expected benefit payments. CSX uses a different discount rate for pension and postretirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans. Each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change. Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent merit increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in assessment of salary scale inflation rates. Health Care Cost Trend Rates Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs, which include claims and administrative fee cost components. The current assumed health care cost trend rate is 11% for Medicare eligible participants and 12% for non Medicare eligible participants and is expected to increase slightly before decreasing gradually until reaching 4.5% in 2013 based upon current actuarial projections. Other Assumptions The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover, and retirement age. These assumptions are based on historical data and are approved by management. 2006 Estimated Pension and Postretirement Expense As a result of changes in assumptions for fiscal year 2006, net periodic pension benefit cost and postretirement benefit costs for 2006 are expected to be approximately $62 million and $30 million, respectively, compared to $46 million and $40 million, respectively in 2005. Currently, there is proposed legislation regarding pension plan funding requirements. If the proposed legislation is passed, pension plan funding requirements will be increased. The impact to the Company of this proposed legislation is unknown at this time.

The Company determined that its medical 45 Table of Contents plans prescription drug benefit will qualify as actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D based upon a review by the plans health and welfare actuary of the plans benefit compared with the benefit that would be paid under Medicare Part D. The reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation as a result of the Act was approximately $56 million as of December 31, 2005. (See Note 18. Employee Benefit Plans.) The Company has applied for the tax free 28% federal reimbursement of total prescription drug claims from $250 to $5,000 paid after January 1, 2006. Combining the financial implications of both cash receipts and lower tax deductible business expenses resulting from the subsidy, the Company expects after tax cash flow savings of approximately $5 million for fiscal year 2006. Additionally, projected postretirement benefit expenses for fiscal year 2006 were reduced by approximately $7 million due to the Act. Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group Life Method CSXT accounts for its rail assets, including main line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group life method. The group life method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole. Under the group life method, the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by the performance of periodic life studies and managements assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties. These studies, called life studies, are conducted by a third party expert, analyzed by the Companys management and approved by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Life studies for equipment assets are completed every three years, whereas road and track life studies are completed every six years as required by the STB. Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and thus the Companys results of operations. Factors taken into account during the life study include: Statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property; Evaluation of current operations; Evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules; Previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use; Expected net salvage expected to be received upon retirement; and Comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. The life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Although recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes, these modifications have not significantly affected the Companys annual depreciation expense. In 2003, the Company completed life studies for all of its rail, equipment and track assets, resulting in an increase in the average useful lives of equipment and track assets, while decreasing the average useful lives of many roadway assets. The combination of these adjustments increased depreciation expense by $1 million in 2003 with a decrease of approximately $13 million in 2004. No life studies were required or completed during 2005. Assets depreciated under the group life method comprise 95% of the Companys total fixed assets of $19.5 billion on a net basis at December 30, 2005. The Companys depreciation expense for the year ended December 30, 2005 amounted to $826 million. A one percentage point increase (or decrease) in the average life of all group life assets would result in an $8 million increase (or decrease) to the Companys annual depreciation expense. 46 Table of Contents Income Taxes Management uses factors such as applicable law, current information and past experience with similar issues in computing its income tax expense. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented. The Company does not anticipate any material change in the methodology or assumptions used in determining the Companys income tax expense. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 1993. Federal income tax returns for 1994 through 2003 currently are under examination. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Also, the Company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX addresses market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments. CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. CSX addresses its exposure to interest rate market risk through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of interest rate swap agreements. The table below illustrates CSXs long term interest rate swap sensitivity. December 30, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Interest Rate Swap Agreements $ 600 Effect of 1% Increase or Decrease in LIBOR Interest Rate 6 During 2003, CSX began a program to hedge its exposure to fuel price volatility through swap transactions. As of December 30, 2005, CSX had hedged approximately 9% of fuel purchases for 2006. At December 30, 2005, a 1% change in fuel prices would result in an increase or decrease in the asset related to the swaps of approximately $1 million. CSXs rail unit average annual fuel consumption is approximately 603 million gallons. A one cent change in the price per gallon, excluding gallons hedged, of fuel would affect fuel expense by approximately $5 million annually. CSX is exposed to loss in the event of non performance by any counter party to the interest rate swap or fuel hedging agreements. CSX does not anticipate non performance by such counter parties, and no material loss would be expected from non performance. The following table highlights CSXs floating rate debt outstanding exclusive of derivative contracts that essentially convert fixed interest rate notes to floating interest rates.
