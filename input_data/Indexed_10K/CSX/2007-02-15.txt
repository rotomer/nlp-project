Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations COMPANY OVERVIEW CSX, which is based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nations leading transportation companies. Surface Transportation, which includes the Companys rail and intermodal businesses, provides rail based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. CSXs principal operating company, CSXT, operates the largest railroad in the eastern United States with a rail network of approximately 21,000 route miles, linking markets in 23 states, the District of Columbia, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Intermodal, one of the nations largest coast to coast intermodal transportation providers, is a stand alone, integrated intermodal company linking customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXs other holdings include CSX Hotels, Inc., a resort doing business as The Greenbrier, located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, and CSX Real Property, Inc., an organization responsible for the management, sale, lease, acquisition and development of company properties. 2006 CSX HIGHLIGHTS SURFACE TRANSPORTATION Revenue grew 11%, or $948 million, to $9.6 billion. Expenses increased $371 million, net of a $168 million gain on insurance recoveries. Operating income increased $577 million to $2.1 billion. Service and safety measurements improved in all categories. Revenue increased 11% from a year ago driven by strong yield management initiatives on flat volumes. Continued pricing efforts, fuel surcharge increases and favorable traffic mix contributed approximately 50%, 30% and 20%, respectively, of the increase in revenue per unit of 11%. The Company was able to achieve the substantial pricing gains due to a strong industrial economy coupled with a shortage of rail, truck and barge capacity. Approximately 85% of CSXs revenue was subject to fuel surcharges or cost escalation clauses, which include a fuel element. Certain revenue markets had strong volume increases, while others were flat or down causing overall volume to be flat compared to last year. Coal, agricultural products, and emerging markets volumes were higher than a year ago. These gains were offset by volume declines in the automotive, phosphates and fertilizers, and forest products markets. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel costs. This was driven by a $194 million decrease in fuel hedge benefits, which directly reduce fuel expense. In addition, there was a 13% increase in the average price per gallon of diesel fuel in 2006. Other expense increases were mostly offset by a $168 million gain on insurance recoveries from Hurricane Katrina. For additional detailed information, refer to Rail and Intermodal Results of Operations discussions on pages 30 and 32, respectively. 20 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The Companys continued focus on safety initiatives and operating plan execution helped all service measurements improve compared to last year. Within the service measures, the key safety measures (personal injury and train accident frequency) improved by more than 20% each in 2006. These improvements were driven by continued focus on safety leadership and train accident prevention processes. Both use training, awareness, compliance measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work environment. Additionally, CSX produced improvement in train operations and asset utilization which drove improvements of about 50% in both on time originations and on time arrivals. Another measure of network fluidity is velocity, which increased 3% for 2006. More important was the consistent week to week velocity, which indicates the network delivered more reliable service to its customers. The table below shows these key measurements and resources. RAIL OPERATING STATISTICS Fiscal Years 2006(a) 2005 Improvement % Service Measurements Personal Injury Frequency Index (Per 200,000 man hours) 1.39 1.77 21 % FRA Train Accidents Frequency (Per million train miles) 3.35 4.41 24 On Time Originations 76.0 % 51.1 % 49 On Time Arrivals 62.7 % 40.1 % 56 Average System Dwell Time (hours)(b) 25.6 29.7 14 Average Total Cars On Line 224,680 233,118 4 Average Velocity, All Trains (miles per hour) 19.8 19.2 3 Average Recrews (per day) 59 68 13 % Increase/(Decrease) Resources Route Miles 21,114 21,357 (1 )% Locomotives (owned and long term leased) 3,851 3,788 2 Freight Cars (owned and long term leased) 101,602 103,544 (2 )% (a) Amounts for 2006 are estimated. (b) In October 2005, the Association of American Railroads adopted a new dwell calculation in an effort to standardize reporting across U.S. railroads. Beginning in 2007 and going forward, CSXT will adopt this new method. If CSXT had used this new method in 2006, average system dwell time would have been 25.1 hours vs 25.6 hours reported above. OTHER ITEMS Free cash flow for 2006 was $361 million which was a decrease of $669 million from a year ago. Last years amount included $1.0 billion from the disposition of the International Terminals business. Excluding that one time item, free cash flow compared to a year ago was higher from better earnings net of higher capital investments. Cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) is reconciled to free cash flow (non GAAP measure) on page 23. Consolidated capital expenditures increased $503 million to $1.6 billion in 2006 compared to the prior year. Surface Transportation core capital expenditures of $1.4 billion were the largest components of the total and of the increase. This increase was primarily due to capital expansion projects. These additions were primarily for track and infrastructure with the remainder spent on locomotives, freight cars and other items, which include technology and facilities for growth. Also included in the year over year increase was the replacement of property damaged by Hurricane Katrina. 21 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The Company also announced 3 major events in 2006. A two for one split of its common stock was approved by the CSX Board of Directors. The Company also increased its quarterly post split dividend to $0.10, which represented an increase of 54% on a per share basis. Last, CSX announced a $500 million share repurchase program to be completed within the first six months of 2007, at such times as CSX deems appropriate. 2007 EXPECTATIONS The Company bases its performance expectations on external forecasts for economic indicators such as gross domestic product, industrial production and overall import levels. The indicators that influence CSXs businesses are expected to be favorable in 2007, but at lower growth rates than the last two years. Considering these and other factors, the Company believes that its business environment remains strong and will support consistent, continuous financial improvements for the next several years. While changes in the macro economy can impact CSXs financial results, the Companys revenues are derived from fairly diversified sources, and this provides stability as specific economic sectors fluctuate. The nations increasing need to transport a substantially greater number of imported products across North America, combined with the significant cost and environmental advantages of rail versus truck transportation, should support continued pricing strength in the Companys Surface Transportation businesses. In addition, recent and continued improvements in the Companys operations and infrastructure are expected to result in volume growth and higher margins over time. Considering the Companys solid overall business environment, along with momentum in its underlying business performance, CSX expects that its financial performance in 2007 will be consistent with its long term financial targets, which include compounded annual growth rates (CAGR) as shown below: Long term Financial Targets 2006 2010 CAGR Revenue Growth 4% 6% Surface Transportation Operating Income Growth 10% 12% Earnings Per Share Growth 12% 14% Free Cash Flow Growth 10% 12% To reinforce its long term vision, the Companys capital budget is expected to be $1.4 billion in 2007. Approximately 76% is being allocated to maintaining existing rail infrastructure and expanding capacity in key corridors. The remaining 24% is being invested in locomotives and freight cars, along with certain technology improvements. The Company anticipates using cash from operations to fund these projects. Additionally, CSX anticipates free cash flow of approximately $500 million in 2007. See page 23 for how free cash flow is calculated. 22 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II In January 2007, the Surface Transportation Board (STB) announced its new policy on railroad fuel surcharges that will govern shipments regulated by the STB, commonly referred to as tariff movements. The STB determined that in the future, fuel surcharges should be based on movement specific factors, such as distance and or weight, rather than as a percentage of revenue. Most of CSXTs shipments are not regulated by the STB ruling; however the Company is analyzing the application of a movement specific fuel surcharge to both its regulated and non regulated shipments. At this time, CSX does not believe this will result in a significant change to future revenue, but is still evaluating the overall impact. On February 14, 2007, CSX announced a $2.0 billion share repurchase program and an increased quarterly dividend on the Companys common stock of 20% to $0.12 per share. The Company intends to complete the repurchase program by the end of 2008. This new authority also terminated the unused portion under the previously announced $500 million program. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is considered a non GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non GAAP Measures. Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Companys financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by generally taking cash from operations and subtracting property additions, dividends paid and certain other investing activities. These other investing activities include proceeds from sale of businesses, insurance proceeds and other items. Also, added to free cash flow is CSXs 42% economic interest in Conrails free cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts. Other deposits, which are included in cash provided by operating activities, are not included in the Companys free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that are set aside for certain future debt payments. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non GAAP measure). Fiscal Years 2006 2005 Change (Dollars in Millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,058 $ 1,110 $ 948 Property additions (a) (1,639 ) (1,136 ) (503 ) Other investing activities 151 69 82 Proceeds from sale (b) 998 (998 ) Dividends (145 ) (93 ) (52 ) Other deposits (68 ) (21 ) (47 ) Conrail free cash flow 4 103 (99 ) Free Cash Flow $ 361 $ 1,030 $ (669 ) (a) Property additions have increased since prior year due to capital expansion projects and the replacement of property damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2006 vs. 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations Both fiscal years 2006 and 2005 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 29, 2006 and December 30, 2005, respectively. CONSOLIDATED (Dollars in Millions) 2006 2005 $ Change % Change Operating Revenue $ 9,566 $ 8,618 $ 948 11 % Operating Expense 7,428 7,068 360 5 Operating Income 2,138 1,550 588 38 Other Income 95 101 (6 ) (6 ) Debt Repurchase (192 ) 192 (100 ) Interest Expense (392 ) (423 ) 31 (7 ) Income Tax Expense (531 ) (316 ) (215 ) 68 Discontinued Operations Net of Tax 425 (425 ) (100 ) Net Earnings $ 1,310 $ 1,145 $ 165 14 % Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Operating Revenue Operating Revenue increased $948 million in 2006 to $9.6 billion, compared to $8.6 billion for the prior year. The primary components of the revenue gain were continued yield management and the Companys fuel surcharge program, which drove revenue per unit across all major markets. 25 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Operating Income Operating Income increased $588 million to $2.1 billion in 2006, which was driven by increased operating revenues. These revenue gains and gains on insurance proceeds from Hurricane Katrina were partially offset by increases in fuel expense caused by higher fuel prices and lower hedge benefits. Other Income Other Income decreased $6 million to $95 million in 2006. This change was driven primarily by lower real estate sales, which was partially offset by a non cash gain on additional Conrail property value received in connection with the 2004 Conrail spin off transaction. Interest Expense Interest Expense decreased $31 million to $392 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. There was lower interest expense from lower average debt balances for 2006 (due to a $1.0 billion debt repurchase in mid 2005). However, this savings was partially offset by higher variable interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income Tax Expense increased $215 million to $531 million in 2006 as a result of higher earnings. This increase was partially offset by the net impact of favorable resolutions of certain tax matters in 2006 that were higher than benefits last year. Net Earnings Net Earnings for 2006 increased $165 million to $1.3 billion, with Earnings Per Share up $.30 to $2.82 per diluted share for the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the following factors: Driven by Surface Transportation results, Earnings from Continuing Operations were up $590 million, or $1.23 per diluted share; Offsetting this increase was Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, of $425 million, or $.93 per diluted share, as a result of the sale of CSXs International Terminals business in 2005. 26 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2005 vs. 2004 Consolidated Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar. Fiscal year 2005 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 30, 2005. Fiscal year 2004 consisted of 53 weeks ending on December 31, 2004.

NM not meaningful Operating Revenue Operating Revenue increased $578 million in 2005 to $8.6 billion, compared to $8.0 billion for the prior year as continued yield management efforts coupled with the Companys fuel surcharge program drove revenue per unit improvements across all major markets. Operating Income Operating Income increased $550 million to $1.6 billion in 2005, as a result of increased operating revenue. Operating expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Other Income Despite the absence of the $16 million net non cash gain (after tax) related to the Conrail spin off transaction, Other Income increased $29 million to $101 million in 2005, primarily as a result of gains from real estate sales. Interest Expense Interest Expense decreased $12 million to $423 million in 2005 compared to the prior year. In June 2005, CSX repurchased $1.0 billion of its publicly traded notes. As a result of the debt repurchase, interest expense was reduced. The savings (from June through December) were mostly offset by rising variable interest rates. Income Tax Expense Income Tax Expense increased $97 million to $316 million in 2005, as a result of higher Earnings from Continuing Operations. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased from 34% in 2004 to 30% in 2005 primarily due to legislative changes in Ohio that will gradually eliminate the Ohio corporate franchise tax. 27 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Net Earnings Net Earnings for 2005 increased $806 million to $1.1 billion, with Earnings Per Share also up significantly by $1.76 per diluted share to $2.52 per diluted share compared to prior year. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: Driven by Surface Transportation results, Earnings from Continuing Operations were up $302 million, or $0.65 per diluted share; Also, Income from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, was up $504 million, or $1.11 per diluted share compared to the prior year. In 2005, CSX recognized $428 million after tax as a result of the sale of its International Terminals business. Discontinued Operations for 2004 was a net loss of $79 million, which included International Terminals net earnings as well as additional income tax expense of $97 million related to undistributed foreign earnings. 28 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2006 vs. 2005 Surface Transportation Results of Operations Both fiscal years 2006 and 2005 consisted of 52 weeks ending on December 29, 2006 and December 30, 2005, respectively.

Revenue for CSXT increased $898 million, or 12%, to $8.2 billion in 2006 from a year ago. Continued yield management and fuel surcharge were the primary drivers of revenue per unit gains. Merchandise Chemicals Revenue and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing environment. Overall volume was down slightly because high raw material costs continued to negatively affect the U.S. chemical industrys competitiveness and in turn, CSX volumes. Emerging Markets Growth was driven by increased shipments of municipal waste, military, and aggregate products (which include rocks and sand). Revenue per unit also improved due to strong pricing actions. Forest Products Shipment of building products and printing paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media conversion. However, revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a favorable pricing environment. Agriculture Products Strong domestic demand in feed grain, soybean, ethanol, and export shipments supported volume and revenue per unit. In addition, strong export demand for grain and increased shipments of beans helped volume growth. Metals Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains and fuel surcharge coverage. Volume increased slightly driven by strong steel demand in the energy and non residential construction end markets. These gains were partially offset by lower demand for steel in the automotive sector. Phosphates and Fertilizers Volume declined from lower export shipments due to increased international phosphate production which caused several domestic phosphate plants to close. Favorable mix coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue per unit. Food and Consumer Volume growth in alcoholic beverages, canned goods, and rice and beans was offset by softness in building products, perishables, and the appliance markets. Strong pricing actions, and a focus on longer, more profitable shipments increased revenue and revenue per unit. Coal Revenue and volume improvements were due to increased shipments of utility and export coal. Utility companies built up their inventories which was a major contributor to CSXs volume growth. Revenue per unit increased due to the continued favorable pricing environment and increased fuel surcharge coverage. Automotive Volume declined due to a reduction in North American light vehicle production. Consistent with the overall automotive market, CSXs volumes continued to shift from the Big 3 to foreign brands produced domestically. Revenue per unit was favorable due to prices increases and fuel surcharge. 30 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Rail Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses for 2006 increased $341 million, or 6%, to $6.3 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes are described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs. These expenses are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned, healthcare plan costs and inflation, and pension and other post retirement plan expenses. These expenses increased $63 million, primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and increased staffing in rail operations. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to personal injury claims, environmental remediation, derailments, utilities, non locomotive fuel, property and sales taxes and professional services. These costs increased by $113 million in 2006 primarily due to materials inflation, along with prior year casualty favorable adjustments and supplier reimbursements that were not repeated. These costs were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations, such as efficient use of locomotives. Depreciation expense primarily relates to capital costs for locomotives, railcars, and track structure, which includes rail, ties, and other track material. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. This expense increased $39 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities. This expense increased $329 million primarily due to reduced hedge benefit from the expiration of the fuel hedge program as well as higher fuel prices. Equipment and Other Rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $18 million due mainly to improvement in operational fluidity, which drove improvements in asset utilization. Inland Transportation expense included in the rail segment amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for shipments on CSXTs network. These intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results. Conrail Rents, Fees and Services include transportation, switching and terminal service charges paid to Conrail for the shared area, purchase price amortization relating to the Conrail purchase, and CSXs 42% share of Conrails income. The $10 million increase in expense was primarily due to prior year federal income tax benefits that were recognized by Conrail but not repeated in 2006. Gain on Insurance Recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina. The $166 million for 2006 represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged, after consideration of the Companys insurance deductible. 31 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2006 vs. 2005 Intermodal Results of Operations Intermodal operating income increased 8% or $20 million versus last year driven by revenue gains of $50 million along with expense containment. The increase in revenue and revenue per unit was driven by the continued yield management emphasis which was partially offset by mix of traffic. Volume increased slightly due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from Asia as well as the strength in the truckload market offset by weaker demand in services sold to transportation brokers (known as wholesale markets). Intermodal operating expense increased $30 million primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs that are reflected in inland transportation expense. Fuel costs were higher due to rising market prices. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel were efficiency gains related to equipment utilization. 32 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2005 vs. 2004 Surface Transportation Results of Operations CSX follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar.

Overall revenue increased $562 million, or 8%, to $7.3 billion in 2005 from $6.7 billion in 2004. Merchandise All merchandise markets experienced revenue growth primarily driven by yield improvement efforts and the Companys fuel surcharge program. Overall merchandise revenue grew 6% to a record $4.2 billion while revenue per unit also achieved record levels increasing 9%. Volume declined 3% due to several factors including an additional week in 2004, impacts of Hurricane Katrina and shedding of low margin traffic. Individual market results are as follows: Chemicals In addition to production disruption from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, chemicals volumes were negatively impacted by high natural gas prices and generally high raw materials inventories. Emerging Markets Emerging markets volumes and revenue were negatively impacted by a significant reduction in shipments of high revenue per unit military traffic. Forest Products Forest products also experienced high revenue per unit increases because of both a favorable pricing environment and a favorable mix shift from short haul, low margin traffic towards longer haul, more profitable traffic. Agricultural Products Despite strong soybean and corn harvests and increased export demand for grain, volume in agricultural products was flat due to declines in processed products such as flour, sweeteners, and vegetable oils. Metals Metals volumes decreased by 5%; however, the pricing environment remained very favorable and resulted in the highest revenue per unit growth within merchandise at 17%. Phosphate and Fertilizers Phosphate and fertilizer volumes were down due to high international inventories of phosphates during the first half of the year and several CSXT served plant curtailments or closures during 2005. Both the chemicals and phosphate and fertilizer groups experienced high revenue per unit increases of 8% and 9%, respectively. Food and Consumer Food and consumer experienced volume growth due to a continued shift of traffic previously handled by trucks to rail and the acquisition of newly finished railcars to other shippers. Coal Revenues increased by 17% to a record $2.1 billion due to both strong volume growth of 5% and revenue per unit improvements of 12%, driven by a favorable pricing environment and CSXTs fuel surcharge program. Most markets experienced strong demand as utility inventory levels remained below target levels. CSXT also reached a settlement agreement in a rate case that resulted in an additional $17 million of revenue in 2005. 34 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Automotive Overall volume was down 4% as North American light vehicle production was flat compared to the prior year. However, vehicle production for the Big 3 was unfavorable 6%, including permanent closures of three General Motors plants served by CSXT. Growth in new shipments from the newly opened Hyundai plant in Montgomery, AL continued to partially offset these declines. Revenue per unit grew 5% on strong yield management and increases in fuel surcharge rates and coverage resulting in record revenue per unit levels. Revenue per unit gains more than offset volume weakness and drove overall revenue growth of 1% compared to the prior year. Rail Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses increased $102 million, or 2% in 2005, compared to the prior year. A brief description of what is included in each category is described in the 2006 vs. 2005 results. Labor and Fringe expense increased $114 million compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in incentive compensation and the effects of inflation. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses increased $44 million primarily due to the effects of inflation, higher reserve requirements for uncollectible accounts, and increased legal fees resulting from the litigation and resolution of certain matters. Depreciation expense increased $115 million primarily due to additional assets received as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction. The rail segment had property additions of approximately $1.1 billion. Fuel expense increased $127 million in 2005, net of $249 million of fuel hedging benefits, compared to the prior year primarily due to fuel price increases. Fuel hedging activity had a $63 million favorable impact on fuel expense for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. The average price per gallon of diesel fuel, including benefits from CSXs fuel hedging program, was $1.31 in 2005 versus $1.10 in 2004. In addition, the fuel surcharge programs and contractual cost escalation clauses used in most multi year customer contracts partially offset fuel cost increases. Equipment and Other Rents decreased $28 million in 2005 as a result of decreased overall volume and lower locomotive lease expense. Inland Transportation decreased $12 million compared to the prior year. The offsetting expense associated with this amount is reflected in Intermodals operating expense, and is thus eliminated at the consolidated level. Conrail Rents, Fees and Services expense decreased $191 million in 2005 as a result of the Conrail spin off transaction, which decreased rents paid to Conrail as assets previously leased from Conrail are now owned directly by CSXT. Additionally, Conrail received a tax benefit from the resolution of various federal income tax audit adjustments during 2005, which increases CSXs equity earnings and offsets Conrail Rents, Fees & Services. 2005 vs. 2004 Intermodal Results of Operations Operating income increased 63% or $96 million in 2006. Continued focus on longer hauls in higher density lanes coupled with sustained strength in pricing increased revenue per unit. Volume was down primarily due to ongoing yield management efforts and a continued focus on network operations designed to increase efficiencies and reduce indirect routing. 35 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Expenses decreased 7% compared to the prior year due to continued service improvements, an emphasis on equipment utilization, and a decrease in volume as discussed above. A decline in trucking expenses associated with line haul moves led to a significant decrease in operating costs associated with a reduction in services. Several productivity initiatives within terminal operations generated efficiencies driving per unit cost reductions compared to the prior year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a companys ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned operational growth. In order to have a complete picture of a companys liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed. Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets CSXs balance sheet continues to reflect a strong liquidity position and capital base. In 2006, cash (which includes cash and cash equivalents) and short term investments increased $298 million to $900 million. This increase was primarily due to higher cash from operations, offset by higher capital spending. Current maturities of long term debt decreased by $344 million versus last year principally related to the reclassification of the Companys convertible debt. In October 2006, debt holders had the option to require CSX to purchase their debentures; however, no significant balances were presented for payment. Because the next option date is in 2008, the debentures are reflected as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. This reclassification increased the Companys working capital as discussed below. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements, for additional details. Working capital can be considered a measure of a companys ability to meet its short term needs. CSXs working capital at December 2006 was $150 million compared to a deficit of $607 million last year. This increase of $757 million year over year was driven by better earnings that produced higher cash and short term investments at year end. Also, current liabilities were lower by $457 million primarily due to the convertible debentures being reclassified into long term debt as described above. The Company believes that in future periods working capital may return to a deficit. A working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including the revolving line of credit and shelf registration, to manage its day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. Sources and Uses of Cash CSX has multiple sources of and required uses of its cash. CSX generates substantial cash balances from its operations. Its financing sources of cash include strong access to the capital markets as well as a significant long term credit facility. Uses of cash include significant, annual reinvestment in infrastructure and equipment, as well as scheduled payments of debt, and leases with manageable near term maturities. The companys cash requirements also include any declared dividends to shareholders. Cash provided by operations in 2006 was $2.1 billion, which was $1.0 billion higher than a year ago. This change was driven mostly by higher earnings from operations. Additionally, the Company made lower cash income tax payments in 2006 primarily due to large cash income tax payments made in 2005 related to the sale of the International Terminals business. 36 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Credit facilities are an untapped source of funding available to CSX. CSX has a $1.25 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May, 2011. See Note 9 Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. CSX also has a $900 million shelf registration. It may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSXs discretion. CSX presently intends to use the proceeds to finance cash requirements, including refinancing existing debt as it matures. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to meeting such needs, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. During 2006, the primary use of cash was to fund property additions and capital expansion projects. Net cash used by investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2006 compared to $36 million last year. This change was attributable primarily to the utilization of $1.0 billion of cash proceeds received from the disposition of CSXs International Terminals business in 2005. Additionally, the Company spent approximately $500 million more for capital additions in 2006. This included additions for property damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The Company completed a debt repurchase of $1.0 billion last year which drove the change in financing activities between 2006 and 2005. Financing activities used cash of $296 million during 2006 compared to cash used of $1.3 billion during 2005. Additionally, in 2006, there was cash used for the share repurchase program partially offset by an increase in cash from proceeds of stock option exercises. The Company anticipates moderately increased use of debt in funding its future cash requirements. Dividend payments are another use of cash. The Company paid dividends of $145 million in 2006, $52 million more than last year. The increase in 2006 was primarily due to the Company increasing post stock split dividends by 54% on a per share basis to $0.10 per share. On February 14, 2007, CSX announced a $2.0 billion share repurchase program and an increased quarterly dividend on the Companys common stock of 20% to $0.12 per share. The Company intends to complete the repurchase program by the end of 2008. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by the Companys management based on their evaluation of market conditions, share price and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. CSX will use cash on hand and cash from operations to fund the share repurchase and the dividend increase. External Factors Credit ratings can also be considered an indicator of a companys liquidity and access to capital. The ratings ranked on a spectrum ranging between highest credit quality on one end and junk on the other. Long term credit ratings are denoted with a letter: AAA is the highest credit quality, and C or D (depending on the rating agency) is the lowest or junk quality. Any rating of BBB or higher is considered to be investment grade. CSXs ratings, along with other large U.S. Class I freight railroads fall within the investment grade category. CSXs long term unsecured debt obligations were rated BBB and Baa2 by Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Services, respectively, both with a Stable outlook as of December 29, 2006. CSXs short term commercial paper program was rated A 2 and P 2 by these agencies, respectively. If CSXs long term unsecured bond ratings were reduced to BBB and Baa3, its undrawn borrowing costs under the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility would not materially increase. If CSXs 37 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II short term commercial paper ratings were reduced to A 3 and P 3, it would increase borrowing costs in the commercial paper market and reduce access to this source of funds because of the more limited demand for lower rated commercial paper. CSX had no commercial paper outstanding at December 29, 2006 or December 30, 2005. SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables sets forth maturities of the Companys contractual obligations and other commitments: Type of Obligation 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total (Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Long term Debt (See Note 9) $ 592 $ 1,092 $ 291 $ 77 $ 575 $ 3,327 $ 5,954 Operating Leases Net (See Note 7) 165 110 85 68 54 196 678 Agreements with Conrail (See Note 17) 18 16 13 9 4 13 73 Purchase Obligations (See Note 7) 469 526 451 283 273 5,247 7,249 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,244 $ 1,744 $ 840 $ 437 $ 906 $ 8,783 $ 13,954 Other Commitments Guarantees (See Note 7) 22 15 16 16 12 14 95 Other 28 3 1 40 72 Total Other Commitments $ 50 $ 18 $ 17 $ 16 $ 12 $ 54 $ 167 OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS For detailed information about the Companys guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: Casualty, environmental and legal reserves Pension and post retirement medical plan accounting Depreciation policies for assets under the group life method Income taxes 38 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves Casualty Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims. Occupational injury claims are broken down into two main categories: asbestos and other. Currently, no individual claim value is expected to exceed the Companys self insurance retention amount. If an individual claim did exceed the amount, insurance is available as more specifically detailed in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. Personal injury and occupational claims are recorded on a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). To the extent the value of an individual claim were to exceed the self insured retention amount, the Company would record the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate with estimates provided by independent third parties reviewed by management, and are offset by the timing of payments. Most of the claims are related to CSXT unless otherwise noted. The amounts recorded by the Company for casualty related liabilities are based upon currently known information, and judgments based upon that information. Projecting future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos and other occupational litigation or legislation in the United States, could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected. While the final outcome of casualty related matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering among other items the meritorious legal defenses available and the liabilities that have been recorded, it is the opinion of management that none of these items, when finally resolved, will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. However, should a number of these items occur in the same period, they could have a material effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year. Personal Injury Personal injury represents liabilities for employee work related and third party injuries. Work related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA). In addition to the FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program and or the Maritime Jones Act. CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi annually and is reviewed by management. The Company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments. The methodology used by the actuary included a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims which was based largely on CSXTs historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Occupational Occupational claims include allegations of exposure to certain materials in the work place, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuel, and alleged chronic physical injuries, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome or hearing loss. 39 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Asbestos The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985. CSXT retains a third party specialist who has extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist in this estimate. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi annually and is reviewed by management. The Company will monitor actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received and expected claim payments. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty. The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its potentially exposed population from which it is able to derive the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Key elements of the assessment include the following: An estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national employment for select years during the period 1938 2001. The Company uses railroad industry historical census data in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees. The projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees age and the duration and intensity of potential exposure while employed. Epidemiology is the medical science that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a population. An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease (non malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Companys average historical claim filing rates for a three year calibration period, excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia. In 2006, the Company received 766 asbestos claims in West Virginia in which the claimants were neither exposed in West Virginia nor residents of the state. CSX believes these claims will not have standing in West Virginia and therefore are excluded from the calibration period. Management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates. An estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is computed using the Companys historical average dismissal rates observed during the current calibration period noted above. An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of incident observed during the current calibration period noted above. 40 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represent claims that are closed without payment, are deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the number of such claims is multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Companys future liability for IBNR asbestos claims. In 2005, management updated their estimate of the unasserted liability exposure with the assistance of the third party specialists, which resulted in recognition of a $48 million favorable change associated with asbestos liabilities (net $38 million favorable change for all occupational liabilities). During 2004 and 2005, asbestos related disease claims filed against CSX dropped substantially, particularly bulk claims filed by certain law firms. In 2003, the Company received a significant number of filings. The Company believes the number was attributable to an attempt to file before a new, more restrictive venue law took effect in West Virginia in mid 2003. As a result, management reassessed the calibration period from a four year average to a three year average, excluding the surge in claims originating in West Virginia. As mentioned before, management believes this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates. There have been no significant changes in 2006. The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims. The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, obtains semi annual updates of the study. Other Occupational The Company engages a third party specialist to assist in projecting the number of other occupational injury claims to be received over the next seven years. Based on this analysis, the Company establishes reserves for the probable and reasonably estimable other occupational injury liabilities. Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the following: An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational diseases is calculated by projecting the total active versus retired employees in the work force from 2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003 report. An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee is computed using the Companys average historical claim filing rates for the calibration periods which management felt are representative of future filing rates. For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the current calibration period is a one year average of claim filings. Hearing loss uses a three year calibration period, and all other diseases or injuries use a two year calibration period. An estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired CSX employee population each year. 41 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of future settlement amounts. During 2005, CSXT experienced an unfavorable trend in settlement values for repetitive stress and other injuries, which resulted in the recognition of a $10 million unfavorable change in estimate associated with these liabilities. There have been no significant changes in 2006. The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims. Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at approximately 254 environmentally impaired sites, many of which are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERLA), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. The majority of these proceedings arise from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. However, a number of these proceedings are based on allegations to the effect that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances for disposal to facilities owned or operated by others. In addition, some of the Companys land holdings are, and have been, leased to others for commercial or industrial operations that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. In any such proceedings, the Company is potentially subject to environmental clean up obligations and enforcement actions under CERLA or similar state laws, which may impose joint and several liability for clean up and enforcement costs. These costs could be substantial, on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. In 2004, the Company assumed $6 million of Conrail environmental liabilities, due to the Conrail transaction. At least once each quarter, CSXT reviews its role with respect to each such location, giving consideration to a number of factors, including: Type of clean up required; Nature of the Companys alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site, or owner or operator of the site); Extent of the Companys alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and Number, connection, and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRPs at the location. In accordance with Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities, at least once a quarter, the Company reviews its role and plans for remediation with respect to each site 42 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II identified. Based on this review, the Company records amounts to cover anticipated contingent future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities are undiscounted and include amounts representing the Companys estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amount of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, latent conditions at any given location could result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to accomplish remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Legal In accordance with SFAS 5, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards. Pension and Post retirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. Employees hired after December 31, 2002 are covered by a cash balance plan, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service, and compensation. In addition to these plans, CSX sponsors one post retirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full time, salaried, management employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. The post retirement medical plan is contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non contributory. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) (SFAS 158), SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions 43 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II (SFAS 87), and SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension (SFAS 106). SFAS 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following: Long term rate of return on plan assets; Discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense; Salary scale inflation rates; Health care cost trend rates; and Other assumptions. These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post retirement plans. As required by SFAS 158, CSX will change its measurement date to the fiscal year end in 2008. The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects as of the beginning of the plan year. The Company reviews the long term rate of return, discount, salary scale inflation, and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. In September 2006, FASB issued SFAS 158, which changed the accounting rules for reporting and disclosures related to pension and other post retirement benefit plans. Companies are now required to include on the balance sheet an additional asset or liability to reflect the funded status of retirement and other post retirement benefit plans, and a corresponding after tax adjustment to equity. Retroactive application of this accounting rule is prohibited; therefore, 2006 is presented as required by SFAS 158 and 2005 is presented as required under the accounting rules prior to SFAS 158. The adoption in 2006 had no effect on the computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and post retirement benefits. See Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans, for the impact on the consolidated balance sheet. Effective 2008, CSX will be required to change the measurement date for post retirement benefit plans from September 30 to the last day of the fiscal year. Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment. The Companys expected long term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its 2006 pension obligation was 8.5%. Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post retirement expense. Assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which both of these 44 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II benefits could be effectively settled. It is appropriate in estimating those rates to look to available information about rates implicit in current prices of annuity contracts that could be used to settle these obligations. In making those estimates, employers may also look to rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available, during the period to maturity of the pension benefits. The Company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans expected benefit payments. The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2006 pension and post retirement obligations are 5.75% and 5.5%, respectively. The Company uses a different discount rate for pension and post retirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans. For pensions, the time horizon is approximately 12 years, while for post retirement, the time horizon is approximately 8 years. Each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change. Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.1% to value its 2006 pension obligation. Health Care Cost Trend Rates Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The current assumed health care cost trend rate is 10% for Medicare eligible participants and 11% for non Medicare eligible participants, and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 4.5% in 2014, based upon current actuarial projections. Other Assumptions The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are approved by management. 2007 Estimated Pension and Post retirement Expense Net periodic pension and post retirement benefits expense for 2007 is expected to be approximately $54 million and $25 million, respectively, compared to $62 million and $30 million, respectively in 2006. The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries, and health care costs on the 2007 estimated pension and post retirement expense: (Dollars in Millions) Pension OPEB Discount Rate 0.25% change $ 4 $ 2 Salary Inflation 0.25% change 3 Health Care Cost 1% change N/A 2 45 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The discount rate for pension and post retirement plans has an inverse relationship with the expense calculation, meaning that as the discount rate increases, expense decreases and vice versa. The other assumptions above have a direct relationship with expense. Pension Protection Act In August 2006, the President of the United States signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 into law. Included in this legislation are changes to the method of valuing pension plan assets and liabilities for funding purposes, as well as the minimum funding levels required by 2008. CSX is determining what impact the new requirements will have on the Companys cash flow; however, initial estimates forecast a 2008 unfunded liability of approximately $185 million after tax. This estimate will be affected by future contributions, investment returns on plan assets and interest rates. Under the transition rules provided, CSX must begin the funding of this 2008 shortfall no later than 2009, and must complete the funding by 2014. The Company anticipates funding pension contributions with cash from operations. Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group Life Method CSXT accounts for its rail assets, including main line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group life method. The group life method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole. Under the group life method, the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties. These life studies are conducted by a third party expert, analyzed by the Companys management and approved by the STB. Life studies for equipment assets are required every three years, whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the STB. Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense, and thus, the Companys results of operations. Factors taken into account during the life study include: Statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property; Evaluation of current operations; Evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules; Previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use; Expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and Comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. The life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes, which did not significantly affect the Companys annual depreciation expense. In 2006, CSXT initiated a life study for its equipment assets with approval and adoption expected in early 2007. CSXT does not expect the life study to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in a particular quarter or fiscal year. Assets depreciated under the group life method comprise 95% of CSXTs total fixed assets of $20.3 billion on a net basis at December 29, 2006. The Companys depreciation expense for the year 46 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II ended December 29, 2006 amounted to $867 million. A one percent change in the average life of all group life assets would result in an $8 million change to the Companys annual depreciation expense. Income Taxes Management uses factors such as applicable law, current information and past experience with similar issues in computing its income tax expense. The Company has not materially changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, (FIN 48), which will be effective for CSX beginning in 2007. FIN 48 provides guidance on measurement, classification, interest and penalties, and disclosures of uncertain tax positions. Differences between the amounts recognized in the financial statements prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts recognized after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements, but is not yet in a position to make this determination. CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 1998. Federal income tax returns for 1997 through 2005 currently are under examination. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Also, the Company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX addresses market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs through the use of derivative financial instruments. CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. CSX addresses its exposure to interest rate market risk through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of interest rate swap agreements. The table below illustrates CSXs long term interest rate swap sensitivity. (Dollars in Millions) December 29,2006 Interest rate swap agreements $ 600 Effect of 1% change in LIBOR interest rate 6 47 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II During 2003, CSX began a program to hedge its exposure to fuel price volatility through swap transactions. In the third quarter of 2004, CSX suspended entering into new swaps in its fuel hedge program. The remainder of the fuel hedge contracts expired in July 2006. CSX is exposed to loss in the event of non performance by any counter party to the interest rate swap agreements. CSX does not anticipate non performance by such counter parties, and no material loss would be expected from non performance.
