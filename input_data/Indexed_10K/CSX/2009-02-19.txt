Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations STRATEGIC OVERVIEW The Company provides customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that links ports, production facilities and distribution centers to markets in the Northeast, Midwest and southern states. The Company serves major markets in the eastern United States and has direct access to all Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports, as well as the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Company also has access to Pacific ports through alliances with western railroads. Overall, the CSXT transportation network encompasses approximately 21,000 route miles of track in 23 states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Company transports a broad portfolio of products, ranging from coal to new energy sources such as ethanol, to automobiles, chemicals and consumer electronics. Those goods are transported across the country in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs. The Companys transportation network serves some of the largest population centers in the nation. More than two thirds of Americans live within the Companys service territory, accounting for about three quarters of the nations consumption. With a mix of pricing, productivity gains, and prudent investment in train network and rail efficiency, the Company will position itself to take full advantage of an eventual economic recovery. Over the past five years, the Company has made substantial strides in improving operating performance. In 2004, CSXT implemented the ONE Plan, which is being updated to drive greater network efficiencies. The Company also continues to advance its Total Service Integration (TSI) initiative, which aims to better align the Companys capabilities with customer demands. TSI aims to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable service to customers. Increases in train size reduce the overall number of shipments resulting in less network congestion and idle time for locomotives and reduce loading and unloading time for customers. These efforts combined with other efficiencies have resulted in substantial improvements in the Companys operating income, operating ratio/margin and free cash flow. 28 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II In 2008, the Company launched the National Gateway, a multi million dollar public private infrastructure initiative to create a more efficient freight transportation link between the Mid Atlantic ports and the Midwest. When completed, the National Gateway will provide greater capacity for product shipments in and out of the Midwest, reduce truck traffic on already crowded highways and create new jobs. The global recession that intensified in late 2008 will continue to impact CSXs business in 2009, and rail volume will be lower for the year. Beginning in late December, the Company began taking aggressive actions to manage costs and right size resources to match demand conditions. The Company has made adjustments to the ONE Plan to reduce the size of its scheduled train network in order to conserve resources. As a result, the Company has begun furloughing employees (which is a temporary layoff) who will return to work when business conditions improve. Additionally, the Company has reduced the number of active locomotives on its network and has placed older locomotives in storage to reduce maintenance costs. The Company will continue to modify the ONE Plan and adjust resources accordingly in order to seek to maximize efficiencies in the current business environment. 29 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2008 HIGHLIGHTS Revenue grew $1.2 billion or 12% to $11.3 billion. Expenses increased $717 million or 9% to $8.5 billion. Operating income increased $508 million or 22% to $2.8 billion. Service and safety measurements remained strong. Despite a challenging economy in the later part of 2008, CSX delivered solid financial results. Revenue and revenue per unit increased 12% and 17%, respectively, from a year ago reflecting yield management initiatives and higher fuel recovery due to higher fuel prices during most of the year. Under CSXTs fuel surcharge program, CSXT bills the customer on a two month lag for fuel. This lag creates higher fuel recovery in a period when fuel prices are declining. Conversely, this lag creates lower fuel recovery in a period when fuel prices are increasing. These positive results in revenue were achieved despite volume declines in three of the Companys four lines of business. The overall 4% volume decrease versus last year was primarily driven by continued weakness in the merchandise market relating to housing construction and associated markets as well as declines in automotive production. For additional information, refer to Rail and Intermodal Results of Operations discussed on pages 38 through 40. Throughout 2008, the Company continued its focus on safety and operating performance. Leadership and high levels of employee commitment to the Companys safety programs delivered solid improvement in both FRA personal injury and train accident frequencies. Personal injury frequency improved to a record 1.14, a 7% improvement compared to 2007. FRA train accident frequency fell to 2.68, an 11% improvement versus the prior year. The Companys safety and train accident prevention programs rely on broad employee involvement. The programs utilize operating rules training, compliance measurement, root cause analysis, communication, structured competition and leadership to create a safer environment for employees and the public. Continued capital investment in Company assets, including track, bridges, signals, and detection technology, also supports improved safety performance. 30 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Key service metrics remained at historically high levels in 2008. On time train originations and arrivals, 79% and 70% respectively, were identical over both years. Average dwell rose slightly to 23.3 hours, primarily due to lower demand levels and resulting surpluses in certain equipment types. Average train velocity declined 1%, although the network remained fluid. Cars on line rose slightly with cars counts increasing 1%. The Company aims to improve key operating measures to achieve increased efficiency and higher levels of service reliability.

The company has taken a balanced approach in deploying its capital through strategic investment, share repurchases and increased dividends for the benefit of shareholders. Capital expenditures of $1.7 billion in 2008 were slightly lower than prior year. The Company remains committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and to positioning itself for long term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. As described below, free cash flow before dividends increased $845 million to $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by increased cash from operations which were a result of higher earnings. CSX also steadily increased the quarterly dividend in 2008. First, CSX increased its quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.18 during the second quarter of 2008. It then increased the dividend again during the third quarter of 2008 to $0.22, which represented a 47% increase from the quarterly dividend level at fourth quarter 2007. Additionally, CSX completed $1.25 billion of its $3 billion share repurchase program announced during 2008. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies. Non GAAP Reconciliation Free cash flow is considered a non GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non GAAP Measures. Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Companys financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and certain other investing activities. Also, added to free cash flow is the Companys 42% economic interest in Conrails free cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non GAAP measure).

Certain prior year data have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. The Company reclassified all items within other operating income and certain items within other income into the Rail segment. As a result of this change, CSX consolidated operating income and Surface Transportation operating income are now the same; therefore, the Company will no longer report separate Surface Transportation results. The Rail segment was not materially impacted by these reclassifications. The Company reclassified all non locomotive fuel related costs previously included in materials, supplies and other into fuel on the Companys consolidated income statement so that it now includes all fuel used for operations and maintenance. For 2008 and 2007, these amounts were $150 million and $102 million, respectively. (b) In addition to CSXT, the Rail segment includes non railroad subsidiaries such as TDSI, Transflo, CSX Technology and other subsidiaries. 36 Table of Contents VOLUME AND REVENUE (Unaudited) Volume (Thousands of Units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Table of ContentsFiscal Years Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % Change Chemicals 488 522 (7) % $1,437 $1,313 9 % $2,945 $2,515 17 % Metals 337 355 (5) 751 702 7 2,228 1,977 13 Total Industrial 825 877 (6) 2,188 2,015 9 2,652 2,298 15 Emerging Markets 429 491 (13) 628 605 4 1,464 1,232 19 Forest Products 316 352 (10) 722 722 2,285 2,051 11 Food and Consumer 199 212 (6) 456 441 3 2,291 2,080 10 Total Housing 944 1,055 (11) 1,806 1,768 2 1,913 1,676 14 Agricultural Products 432 410 5 1,011 786 29 2,340 1,917 22 Phosphates and Fertilizers 335 362 (7) 460 421 9 1,373 1,163 18 Total Agriculture 767 772 (1) 1,471 1,207 22 1,918 1,563 23 Total Merchandise 2,536 2,704 (6) 5,465 4,990 10 2,155 1,845 17 Coal 1,779 1,771 3,110 2,483 25 1,748 1,402 25 Coke and Iron Ore 100 91 10 175 120 46 1,750 1,319 33 Total Coal 1,879 1,862 1 3,285 2,603 26 1,748 1,398 25 Automotive 343 439 (22) 784 839 (7) 2,286 1,911 20 Other 255 242 5 Total Rail 4,758 5,005 (5) 9,789 8,674 13 2,057 1,733 19 International 1,000 1,132 (12) 509 525 (3) 509 464 10 Domestic 1,069 979 9 929 807 15 869 824 5 Other 28 24 17 Total Intermodal 2,069 2,111 (2) 1,466 1,356 8 709 642 10 Total 6,827 7,116 (4) % $11,255 $10,030 12 % $1,649 $1,409 17 % Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 37 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2008 vs. 2007 Rail Results of Operations Rail Operating Revenue Rail revenue, which excludes Intermodal, is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Rail revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 13%, to $9.8 billion in 2008 as compared to prior year. CSXT was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the Companys rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. Higher fuel cost recovery, coupled with favorable pricing, more than offset volume losses driven by the weakening economy. Merchandise Chemicals Revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment and fuel recoveries. Volume was down as a result of declines in plastic and plastic feedstock shipments, driven by weakness in housing, automotive and consumer goods markets. Emerging Markets Revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management efforts and favorable fuel recovery. Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in both residential and non residential construction. These declines more than offset growth in shipments of scrubber limestone and transportation equipment. Forest Products Revenue was flat and volume declined as shipments of building products slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts. Further driving volume declines was a reduction in printing paper and newsprint as a combination of electronic media substitution and reduced advertising pages affected demand. Agricultural Products Revenue and volume increased due to continued growth in ethanol shipments and strong domestic demand in feed ingredients. Revenue per unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management and increased fuel recovery. Metals Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to higher fuel recovery and continued pricing actions. Lower demand for steel due to continued weakness in construction and automobile production resulted in volume declines. These declines more than offset growth in shipments of pipe which were driven by increases in drilling activity and pipeline construction. Phosphates and Fertilizers Volume declined in phosphate shipments as weak international and domestic demand resulted in plant curtailments. Revenue per unit increases were driven primarily by yield initiatives and increased fuel recovery. 38 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Food and Consumer Volume declined with decreased demand for building products, appliances and consumer goods driven by the weakening economy and housing market. Revenue per unit growth resulted from favorable fuel recoveries and yield initiatives. Coal Favorable pricing and fuel recovery positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit. Volumes were slightly up as strength in the export and river markets were offset by weakness in electric utility shipments. Automotive Volume and revenue declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures, and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment. Consistent with the overall automotive market, volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically. Revenue per unit improved due to yield initiatives and higher fuel recoveries. Rail Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses for 2008 increased 10% or $637 million to $7.3 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs. These expenses are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned, healthcare plan costs, and pension and other post retirement plan expenses. These expenses decreased $26 million primarily driven by reduced staffing levels and lower benefit costs which were mostly offset by wage inflation. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. Materials, supplies and other expenses increased by $186 million in 2008 primarily due to favorable personal injury reserve benefits in the prior year. Additionally, these costs increased as a result of inflation, proxy contest and related litigation costs and other items. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. This expense increased $503 million due to higher fuel prices during most of the year which more than offset increased fuel efficiency. 39 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. This expense increased $30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending. This increase was partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies. Equipment and Other Rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $24 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases. Inland Transportation expense included in the rail segment is primarily for amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for shipments on CSXTs network. These intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results. The remaining consolidated amount is expense paid by Intermodal to other transportation companies. Gain on Insurance Recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina. The decrease of $27 million is attributable to gains recognized in 2007 that were not repeated in 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Intermodal Results of Operations Intermodal operating income increased to $290 million, an increase of 12% or $30 million versus last year. Improved fuel recovery and a favorable traffic mix boosted revenue per unit and allowed for an 8% increase in revenue despite 2% fewer loads. The volume impact of the continued deceleration of international traffic was somewhat offset by domestic growth in railroad provided container shipments, over the road truckload conversion, and short haul moves in the Southeast. Intermodal operating expense increased 7% or $80 million to $1.2 billion driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased purchased transportation expense linked to growth in domestic transcontinental traffic. Additionally, depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives that was completed a year ago. 40 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2008 vs. 2007 Additional Consolidated Results Other Income (Expense) Net Other income decreased $192 million to a net expense of $103 million in 2008 primarily due to the recognition of a pre tax impairment loss of $166 million related to the write down of the investment in The Greenbrier resort. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $102 million in 2008 to $519 million due primarily to higher average debt balances in 2008. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $75 million to $781 million which was driven by higher operating income in 2008. This increase was partially offset by an $18 million income tax benefit during 2008 principally related to the settlement of federal income tax audits and certain other tax matters. Net Earnings Net earnings increased $29 million to $1.4 billion and earnings per diluted share increased $.35 to $3.34 in 2008. This increase was primarily due to the following factors: Operating income increased $508 million primarily driven by higher revenues. This increase in operating income was offset by an impairment loss associated with The Greenbrier resort along with higher interest expense due to higher debt levels. Offsetting this increase was a $110 million 2007 tax benefit associated with the sale of CSXs International Terminals business which is reported as discontinued operations in the prior year. 41 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2007 vs. 2006 Results of Operations (Dollars in Millions) Fiscal Year CSX Rail (b) Intermodal Consolidated (a) 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 $ Change % Change Revenue $8,674 $8,154 $1,356 $1,412 $10,030 $9,566 $464 5 % Operating Expense: Labor and Fringe 2,905 2,848 81 82 2,986 2,930 (56) 2 Materials, Supplies and Other (a) 1,747 1,653 178 187 1,925 1,840 (85) 5 Fuel (a) 1,307 1,204 5 5 1,312 1,209 (103) 9 Depreciation 849 819 34 38 883 857 (26) 3 Equipment and Other Rents 341 377 110 130 451 507 56 (11) Inland Transportation (448) (462) 688 704 240 242 2 (1) Gain on Insurance Recoveries (27) (166) (2) (27) (168) (141) (84) Total Expense 6,674 6,273 1,096 1,144 7,770 7,417 (353) 5 Operating Income $2,000 $1,881 $260 $268 $2,260 $2,149 $111 5 Other Income (Expense) Net 89 84 5 6 Interest Expense (417) (392) (25) 6 Income Tax Expense (706) (531) (175) 33 Earnings from Continuing Operations 1,226 1,310 (84) (6) Discontinued Operations 110 110 NM Net Earnings $1,336 $1,310 $26 2 Earnings Per Diluted Share From Continuing Operations 2.74 2.82 (0.08) (3) Discontinued Operations 0.25 0.25 NM Net Earnings 2.99 2.82 0.17 6 % Operating Ratio 76.9% 76.9% 80.8% 81.0% 77.5% 77.5% Total Assets $24,502 $24,212 $283 $276 NM not meaningful a) Beginning in 2008, certain items have been reclassified within the income statement. Certain prior year data have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. The Company reclassified all items within other operating income and certain items within other income into the Rail segment. As a result of this change, CSX consolidated operating income and Surface Transportation operating income are now the same; therefore, the Company will no longer report separate Surface Transportation results. The Rail segment was not materially impacted by these reclassifications. The Company reclassified all non locomotive fuel related costs previously included in materials, supplies and other into fuel on the Companys consolidated income statement so that it now includes all fuel used for operations and maintenance. For 2007 and 2006, these amounts were $102 million and $97 million, respectively. b) In addition to CSXT, the Rail segment includes non railroad subsidiaries such as TDSI, Transflo, CSX Technology, and other subsidiaries. 42 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II VOLUME AND REVENUE (Unaudited) Volume (Thousands of Units); Revenue (Dollars in Millions); Revenue Per Unit (Dollars) Fiscal Years Volume Revenue Revenue Per Unit 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 % Change Chemicals 522 528 (1) % $1,313 $1,210 9 % $2,515 $2,292 10 % Metals 355 364 (2) 702 673 4 1,977 1,849 7 Total Industrial 877 892 (2) 2,015 1,883 7 2,298 2,111 9 Emerging Markets 491 524 (6) 605 580 4 1,232 1,107 11 Forest Products 352 404 (13) 722 773 (7) 2,051 1,913 7 Food and Consumer 212 245 (13) 441 477 (8) 2,080 1,947 7 Total Housing 1,055 1,173 (10) 1,768 1,830 (3) 1,676 1,560 7 Agricultural Products 410 397 3 786 681 15 1,917 1,715 12 Phosphates and Fertilizers 362 362 421 354 19 1,163 978 19 Total Agriculture 772 759 2 1,207 1,035 17 1,563 1,364 15 Total Merchandise 2,704 2,824 (4) 4,990 4,748 5 1,845 1,681 10 Coal 1,771 1,798 (2) 2,483 2,259 10 1,402 1,256 12 Coke and Iron Ore 91 94 (3) 120 119 1 1,319 1,266 4 Total Coal 1,862 1,892 (2) 2,603 2,378 9 1,398 1,257 11 Automotive 439 463 (5) 839 847 (1) 1,911 1,829 4 Other 242 181 34 Total Rail 5,005 5,179 (3) 8,674 8,154 6 1,733 1,574 10 International 1,132 1,281 (12) 525 580 (9) 464 453 2 Domestic 979 898 9 807 786 3 824 875 (6) Other 24 46 (48) Total Intermodal 2,111 2,179 (3) 1,356 1,412 (4) 642 648 (1) Total 7,116 7,358 (3) % $10,030 $9,566 5 % $1,409 $1,300 8 % 43 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2007 vs. 2006 Rail Results of Operations Rail Operating Revenue Rail revenue is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Revenue increased $520 million, or 6%, to $8.7 billion in 2007 as compared to prior year. CSXT was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the Companys rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. These pricing gains more than offset volume weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related markets. Merchandise Chemicals Revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment. Overall volume declined slightly driven by reduced chlorine shipments and weakness in propane demand due to a milder winter in 2007. Emerging Markets Revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management efforts. Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in residential construction. Forest Products Revenue and volume declined as shipments of building products and paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media substitution. Agricultural Products Strong domestic demand in feed ingredients and soybean shipments supported growth in volume and revenue. Ethanol volumes also increased as a result of expanded use in the Northeast. Revenue per unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management. Metals Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing actions. Lower demand for steel due to weakness in housing construction and domestic automobile production resulted in volume declines. Phosphates and Fertilizers Volume was flat as higher domestic demand was offset by a decrease in export shipments. Favorable mix driven by these volume changes coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue and revenue per unit. Food and Consumer Revenue and volume declines were driven by decreased demand for building products, appliances and roofing granules, which are used to make shingles. 44 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Coal Favorable pricing positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit. Overall tonnage was flat even though carloads slightly declined due to the use of higher capacity cars allowing the movement of more tons with fewer cars. Strength in the export market was offset by weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles remain at record high levels. Automotive Volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures, and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment. Consistent with the overall automotive market, volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically. Other Rail Revenue The change is primarily due to increased shipments by the Companys regional railroads and more transloading activities associated with ethanol shipments. Rail Operating Expense Total rail operating expenses for 2007 increased 6% or $401 million to $6.7 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below. Labor and Fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs. These expenses are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned, healthcare plan costs, and pension and other post retirement plan expenses. These expenses increased $57 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation, which was partially offset by improved productivity and reduced staffing levels. Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to personal injury claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, property and sales taxes and professional services. Overall, materials, supplies and other expenses increased by $94 million in 2007 primarily due to inflation, higher train accident related costs and higher environmental costs. These costs were partially offset by $99 million of favorable personal injury reserve adjustments during the year. This was due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003. 45 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. This expense increased $30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies. Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non locomotive fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities. This expense increased $103 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and prior year hedge benefits that were not repeated during 2007 due to the expiration of the fuel hedge program. Equipment and Other Rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $36 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases. Inland Transportation expense included in the rail segment is for amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for shipments on CSXTs network. These intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results. The remaining consolidated amount is expense paid by Intermodal to other transportation companies. Gain on Insurance Recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina. While gains were recognized in both years, the $139 million decrease for 2007 was due to higher cash receipts for lost profits and replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged in 2006 versus 2007. 2007 vs. 2006 Intermodal Results of Operations Intermodal operating income declined 3% or $8 million to $260 million versus last year on 4% lower revenue, partially offset by volume related cost savings. Revenue and volume decreases reflect losses of several international customers, the slowing of Asian imports throughout the year and mix impact related to growth in new short haul domestic traffic. Other revenue declined $22 million from the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers as well as lower general business levels. Revenue per unit declined slightly with yield gains in the international market being offset by mix changes related to the new short haul domestic traffic. Despite rising fuel costs, Intermodal operating expense declined 4% or $48 million to $1.1 billion driven by lower car hire expense related to volume and improved operational efficiency. Additionally, depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives. 46 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II 2007 vs. 2006 Additional Consolidated Results of Operations Other Income Other income of $89 million in 2007 was relatively flat compared to the prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $25 million to $417 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense increased $175 million to $706 million. This change is primarily due to higher earnings in 2007 and a prior year income tax benefit of $151 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters that was not repeated. Net Earnings Consolidated net earnings increased $26 million and totaled $1.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.17 to $2.99. The principal elements of these increases were: Operating income increased $111 million driven by strong operating results. These strong results were more than offset by $151 million of prior year income tax benefits that were not repeated. The net of these and other items decreased earnings from continuing operations by $84 million or $.08 per diluted share. The $110 million or $.25 per diluted share gain in discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated income statement in 2007 related to the resolution of certain tax matters associated with previously discontinued operations. 47 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a companys ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned capital expenditures. In order to have a complete picture of a companys liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed. Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets CSXs balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSXs balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes reinvestment in the Companys existing infrastructure, investments in the network, share repurchases and dividends. Long term debt increased $1 billion to $7.5 billion driven by debt issuances of $1.35 billion in 2008. This increase was partially offset by a $464 million decrease in current maturities of long term debt due mainly to debt repayments and convertible debt being converted into CSX common stock. Total shareholders equity decreased $637 million during 2008. This decrease was mainly attributable to share repurchases that exceeded net earnings as well as adjustments to other comprehensive income related to unrealized pension losses and the payment of dividends. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies. Sources and Uses of Cash The Company has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2008, the Company generated $2.9 billion of cash from operating activities, which represented a $730 million increase from the prior year due to higher cash flow generated from rail and intermodal operations. Second, CSX has numerous financing sources including a $1.25 billion five year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2012. This facility can be increased by an additional $500 million to $1.75 billion with the approval of the lending banks. See Note 8, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. CSX also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSXs discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. 48 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Among other things, the Company uses cash for share repurchases and scheduled payments of debt and leases. CSX also uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders, as declared by the Board of Directors. CSX paid dividends of $308 million in 2008, which was $77 million more than prior year. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to CSX increasing quarterly dividends to $0.22 per share. CSX also repurchased $1.6 billion of shares in 2008. Net cash used by investing activities during 2008 was $1.4 billion. This use of funds was predominately driven by $1.7 billion of capital additions which are further described below. This use of cash was slightly offset by proceeds from sales of short term investments. Fiscal Years Capital Additions (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Track, Bridges, Signals and Other Related $933 $821 $714 Locomotives and Freight Cars 454 458 373 Capacity and Commercial Facilities 147 272 247 Hurricanes Katrina / Gustav Asset Replacement 42 24 114 Other 164 198 191 Total $1,740 $1,773 $1,639 Capital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe, efficient and reliable transportation services. For 2009, CSX plans to spend $1.6 billion of capital of which approximately 90% will be used to sustain the core infrastructure, terminals, locomotives, freight cars and technology. The remaining 10% will be allocated to high return growth and productivity investments. CSX is continually evaluating market and regulatory conditions that could affect the Companys ability to generate sufficient returns on capital investments. CSX may revise this estimate as a result of changes in business conditions, tax legislation or the enactment of new laws or regulations. Liquidity and Working Capital Currently, CSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with over $700 million of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. CSX also has a $1.25 billion credit facility with a diverse portfolio of banks that was not drawn on. Additionally, in January 2009, the Company took advantage of an improvement in capital market conditions and issued $500 million of new debt. Working capital can also be considered a measure of a companys ability to meet its short term needs. CSX had a working capital deficit of $13 million and $180 million at December 2008 and 2007, respectively. The favorable change was primarily due to increased earnings. 49 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The Companys working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. A working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. Furthermore, CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including the credit facility and shelf registration statement, to manage its day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity. Due to the current economic and credit market environment, CSX may be unable to access capital due lack of market demand or may experience higher interest costs. Credit Ratings Credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poors (S&P) and Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is AAA+ and Aaa1 for S&P and Moodys, respectively. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Long term ratings of BBB and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moodys, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade. Currently, the long term ratings for CSXs obligations fall within the investment grade band of credit quality. Following CSXs 2008 annual meeting, S&P issued a release noting its outlook for CSX changed to negative as a result of the new Board composition; however, S&P further noted it does not anticipate downgrading the rating unless CSX is no longer committed to targeting an investment grade capital structure or adopts a more aggressive financial policy. Moodys outlook for CSX continues to be stable. If CSXs credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, the markets demand, and thus the Companys ability to readily issue new debt, could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment. 50 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II SCHEDULE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables set forth maturities of the Companys contractual obligations and other commitments: Type of Obligation 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (Dollars in Millions) (Unaudited) Contractual Obligations Long term Debt (See Note 8) $319 $106 $605 $507 $782 $5,512 $7,831 Operating Leases Net (See Note 6) 77 65 55 52 35 170 454 Agreements with Conrail (a) 13 9 4 3 3 6 38 Purchase Obligations (See Note 6) 529 353 449 337 310 4,848 6,826 Total Contractual Obligations $938 $533 $1,113 $899 $1,130 $10,536 $15,149 Other Commitments Guarantees (See Note 6) $16 $16 $13 $12 $ $ $57 Other(b) 64 1 40 105 Total Other Commitments $80 $17 $13 $12 $ $40 $162 (a) Agreements with Conrail (for information about Conrail see Note 14, Related Party Transactions) represent minimum future lease payments for freight cars and locomotives and is included in total net lease commitments of $492 million disclosed in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies. (b) Other commitments of $64 million predominately consisted of bonds in force. These bonds are surety bonds issued as a guarantee that CSX will perform its contractual obligation. 51 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS For detailed information about the Companys guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies. There are no off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: casualty, environmental and legal reserves; pension and post retirement medical plan accounting; depreciation policies for assets under the group life method; and income taxes Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves Casualty Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Companys self insured retention amount. To the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). These reserves fluctuate with changes in estimates provided by independent third parties and reviewed by management, and are offset by the timing of payments. Most of the claims were related to CSXT unless otherwise noted. 52 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. The Company is presently self insured up to $25 million per injury for personal injury and occupational related claims. Personal Injury Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work related and third party injuries. Work related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to FELA. In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act. CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXTs historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. Based on managements review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $99 million during 2007. This reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003. The analyses further indicated an absence of large catastrophic claims since 2003, which also was determined to be a trend. These reductions were included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements. Occupational Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss. Asbestos The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business. 53 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Companys claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi annually and is reviewed by management. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty. The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Key elements of the assessment include the following: An estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national employment for select years during the period 1938 2001. The Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees. The projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees age and the duration and intensity of potential exposure while employed. Epidemiology is the medical science that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a population. An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease (non malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Companys average historical claim filing rates for a three year calibration period, excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia in 2006. These claimants were neither exposed to asbestos in West Virginia nor residents of the state. 850 of these claims remain outstanding. The Company believes these claims will not have merit as no medical evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims and therefore the Company has excluded them from the calibration period. Claim levels have since returned to expected levels and management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates. An estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is computed using the Companys historical average dismissal rates observed during the current calibration period noted above. 54 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of incident observed during the current calibration period noted above. From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represented claims that were closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Companys future liability for IBNR asbestos claims. The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims. Other Occupational The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Companys claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi annually and is reviewed by management. Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the following: An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from 2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003 report. An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee is computed using the Companys average historical claim filing rates for the calibration periods management felt were representative of future filing rates. For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the current calibration period is a 1 year average of claim filings. Hearing loss uses a 3 year calibration period, and all other diseases or injuries use a 2 year calibration period. An estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired Company population each year. 55 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is computed using the Companys historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of future settlement amounts. The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims. Environmental The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 244 environmentally impaired sites. Many of those are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. However, a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of the Companys land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. 56 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II In accordance with Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least once a quarter, giving consideration to a number of factors such as: type of clean up required; nature of the Companys alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site); extent of the Companys alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location. Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the Companys estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made over the next several years. Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Legal In accordance with SFAS 5, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 57 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards. Pension and Post retirement Medical Plan Accounting The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired in 2003 or thereafter, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. CSX made pension plan contributions of $102 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2008. In addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post retirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full time, salaried, management employees hired prior to 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. The post retirement medical plan is contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non contributory. The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) (SFAS 158), SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS 87), and SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension (SFAS 106). SFAS 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following: long term rate of return on plan assets; discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense; salary scale inflation rates; health care cost trend rates; and other assumptions. 58 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company previously used a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post retirement plans. During 2008, CSX changed its measurement date to its fiscal year end in accordance with SFAS 158. The effect of the change was a $13 million after tax reduction to retained earnings. The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the long term rate of return, discount, salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. Long term Rate of Return on Plan Assets The expected long term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment. The Companys expected long term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its 2008 pension obligation was 8.5%. Discount Rates Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Companys expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans expected benefit payments. The discount rate used by the Company to value its 2008 pension and post retirement obligations is 6.5%. Each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change. 59 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Salary Scale Inflation Rates Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 3.8% to value its 2008 pension obligation. Health Care Cost Trend Rates Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The current assumed health care cost trend rate is 9.5% for Medicare eligible participants and 8.5% for non Medicare eligible participants and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 5% in 2017, based upon current actuarial projections. Other Assumptions The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are selected by management. 2009 Estimated Pension and Post retirement Expense Net periodic pension and post retirement benefits expense for 2009 is expected to be approximately $44 million and $31 million, respectively, compared to $33 million and $31 million, respectively in 2008. The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2009 estimated pension and post retirement expense: (Dollars in Millions) Pension OPEB Discount Rate 0.25% change $4 $1 Salary Inflation 0.25% change $1 $ Health Care Cost 1% change N/A $1 60 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group Life Method CSXT accounts for its rail assets, including main line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group life method. The group life method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole. Under the group life method, the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying managements assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties. These life studies are conducted by a third party expert, analyzed by the Companys management and approved by the STB. Life studies for equipment assets are required every three years, whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the STB. Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense, and thus, the Companys results of operations. Factors taken into account during the life study include: statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property; evaluation of current operations; evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules; previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use; expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies. The life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. Recent experience with life studies has resulted in depreciation rate changes, which did not significantly affect the Companys annual depreciation expense. In 2007, CSXT initiated life studies for its road, equipment and track assets that concluded in 2008, resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense for equipment and road assets and an increase in depreciation expense for track assets. 61 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II Assets depreciated under the group life method comprise 93% of CSXTs total fixed assets of $23 billion on a net basis at December 2008. The Companys depreciation expense for 2008 amounted to $904 million. A 1% change in the average life of all group life assets would result in a $9 million change to the Companys annual depreciation expense. Income Taxes In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which became effective for CSX beginning in 2007. FIN 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Companys reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2003 and for 2007. Federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2006 currently are under appeal. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Also, the Company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs, but as of December 2008, the Company did not have a significant position in derivative financial instruments. At December 2008, CSX had $85 million of outstanding floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause a $1 million change in interest expense. 63 Table of Contents CSX CORPORATION PART II
