Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Business Strategy Cintas provides highly specialized products and services to businesses of all types primarily throughout the United States and Canada. We refer to ourselves as "The Service Professionals." We bring value to our customers by helping them provide a cleaner, safer, more pleasant atmosphere for their customers and employees. Our products and services are designed to improve our customers images. We also help our customers protect their employees and their company by enhancing workplace safety and helping to ensure legal compliance in key areas of their business. We are North Americas leading provider of corporate identity uniforms through rental and sales programs, as well as a significant provider of related business services, including entrance mats, restroom products and services, first aid, safety and fire protection products and services, document management services and branded promotional products. Our business strategy is to achieve revenue growth for all of our products and services by increasing our penetration at existing customers and by broadening our customer base to include business segments to which Cintas has not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future customers. To pursue the strategy of increasing penetration, we have a highly talented and diverse team of service professionals visiting our customers on a regular basis. This frequent contact with our customers enables us to develop close personal relationships. The combination of our distribution system and these strong customer relationships provides a platform from which we launch additional products and services. We pursue the strategy of broadening our customer base in a few ways. Cintas has a national sales organization introducing all of our products and services to prospects in all business segments. Our ever expanding range of products and services allows our sales organization to consider any type of business a prospect. We also broaden our customer base through geographic expansion, especially in our emerging businesses of first aid and safety, fire protection and document management. Finally, we evaluate strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. Results of Operation The economic environment in fiscal 2009 presented challenges not experienced in decades. The financial crisis which began in September, 2008, caused many of our customers to immediately reduce spending. As the economic turmoil continued, we saw our customers make dramatic reductions in spending. Significant job losses in the U.S. and Canada followed the financial crisis, as these economies lost millions of jobs from October, 2008, through May, 2009. The suddenness and severity of the economic downturn required us to react quickly to reduce our cost structure. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we closed two manufacturing plants in Kentucky, initiated hiring and wage freezes in many parts of the organization, eliminated many overhead positions and reduced discretionary and capital spending. These initiatives resulted in a reduction to selling and administrative expenses of approximately $60 million when comparing the last six months of fiscal 2009 to the first six months of fiscal 2009. In addition to the actions described above, we initiated restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reduce excess capacity and further reduce our cost structure. These activities included closing or converting to branches 16 of our rental processing plants and reducing our workforce by 1,200 employees. We 14 Table of Contents expect these restructuring activities to be completed by May 31, 2010. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $48.9 million in long lived asset impairment costs, $7.9 million in employee termination costs and $2.3 million in other exit costs for a total of $59.1 million that will be incurred as a result of this restructuring. The following summarizes these amounts by operating segment: (In millions) May 31, 2009 Rental Uniforms & Ancillary Products Uniform Direct Sales First Aid, Safety & Fire Protection Document Management Total Restructuring charges $ 8.8 $ 0.5 $ 0.6 $ 0.3 $ 10.2 Impairment of long lived assets 44.2 4.1 0.6 48.9 Loss before income taxes $ 53.0 $ 4.6 $ 1.2 $ 0.3 $ 59.1 A progression of our restructuring liability balance, primarily recorded in accrued compensation and related liabilities, at May 31, 2009, is as follows: (In millions) Employee Termination Costs Other Exit Costs Total Charge to earnings fiscal 2009 $ 7.9 $ 2.3 $ 10.2 Cash paid fiscal 2009 (2.0 ) (2.0 ) Balance as of May 31, 2009 $ 5.9 $ 2.3 $ 8.2 The restructuring activities are more fully described in Note 2 entitled Restructuring and Related Activity of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Despite the economic turmoil during fiscal 2009, we were still able to generate strong operating cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $523.5 million. We reduced capital and acquisition spending by $110.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. We were able to pay down $157.1 million in net borrowings during fiscal 2009, resulting in no outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of May 31, 2009. Additionally, we were still able to pay shareholders an increased dividend of $0.47 per share. Cintas classifies its businesses into four operating segments. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment reflects the rental and servicing of uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, mats, mops and shop towels and other ancillary items. In addition to these rental items, restroom and hygiene products and services are also provided within this operating segment. The Uniform Direct Sales operating segment consists of the direct sale of uniforms and related items and branded promotional products. The First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment consists of first aid, safety and fire protection products and services. The Document Management Services operating segment consists of document destruction, document imaging and document retention services. 15 Table of Contents The following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenue by operating segment and in total for the periods indicated. 2009 2008 2007 Revenue: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products 73.0 % 72.0 % 73.8 % Uniform Direct Sales 11.4 % 13.1 % 13.5 % First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services 10.0 % 10.3 % 9.8 % Document Management Services 5.6 % 4.6 % 2.9 % Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products 56.7 % 55.8 % 55.4 % Uniform Direct Sales 75.2 % 67.5 % 68.0 % First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services 61.9 % 60.1 % 60.1 % Document Management Services 49.4 % 45.4 % 47.6 % Total cost of sales 58.9 % 57.3 % 57.3 % Gross margin: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products 43.3 % 44.2 % 44.6 % Uniform Direct Sales 24.8 % 32.5 % 32.0 % First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services 38.1 % 39.9 % 39.9 % Document Management Services 50.6 % 54.6 % 52.4 % Total gross margin 41.1 % 42.7 % 42.7 % Selling and administrative expenses 28.7 % 28.0 % 27.1 % Restructuring charges 0.3 % Impairment of long lived assets 1.3 % Interest income 0.1 % 0.1 % 0.2 % Interest expense 1.3 % 1.3 % 1.4 % Income before income taxes 9.6 % 13.5 % 14.4 % The reduction in Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 2009 reflects the significant reduction in spending by customers of these businesses during the economic turmoil in fiscal 2009. Despite a significant decrease in the price of recycled paper prices during fiscal 2009, Document Management Services revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue over the last two fiscal years as a result of acquisitions and internal growth in our destruction services. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to lower revenue levels in all operating segments other than Document Management Services. The significant deterioration of the U.S. and Canadian economies, particularly in the last five months of the year ended May 31, 2009, which led to reduced revenue levels in our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment, created excess inventory levels in these operating segments. As a result, we reduced the carrying amount of specific inventory to 16 Table of Contents realizable values and recorded a pre tax loss in the year ended May 31, 2009, of $27.5 million. The following summarizes this loss by operating segment: (In millions) May 31, 2009 Rental Uniforms & Ancillary Products Uniform Direct Sales First Aid, Safety & Fire Protection Document Management Total Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products $ 8.4 $ $ $ $ 8.4 Cost of other services 16.1 3.0 19.1 Loss on inventory valuation $ 8.4 $ 16.1 $ 3.0 $ $ 27.5 Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in Document Management Services increased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of a significant decrease in the price of recycled paper. This operating segment derives revenue from the sale of shredded paper to paper recyclers. The weighted average price of standard office paper, which accounts for the majority of the recycled paper revenue, dropped by 24.2% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of the lower revenue in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2009 total revenue was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 4.1% compared to fiscal 2008. Acquisitions in our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment and our Document Management Services operating segment accounted for growth of 0.7% during fiscal 2009. Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note 10 entitled Acquisitions of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Total revenue decreased organically by 4.5%. The difficult U.S. and Canadian economic environments that began with the financial crisis in our second fiscal quarter deteriorated in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. These economies lost millions of jobs from October, 2008, through May, 2009. Because of customer job losses, we experienced decreases in uniform revenue, both rented and purchased, and revenue for our hygiene products and first aid and safety products. In addition, facility closures by our customers reduced our volume of entrance mats, mops, shop towels and other facility needs such as fire protection services and document management services. Fiscal 2009 had one fewer workday than fiscal 2008, which resulted in a decrease in revenue of 0.3%. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment decreased 2.8% compared to fiscal 2008. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue decreased organically by 2.4% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue was primarily due to decreased uniform wearers caused in large part by job losses in the U.S. and Canadian economies. Fiscal 2009 had one fewer workday than fiscal 2008, which resulted in a decrease in revenue of 0.4%. Other Services revenue, consisting of revenue from the reportable operating segments of Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services, decreased 7.6% compared to fiscal 2008. Acquisitions in our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment and our Document Management Services operating segment accounted for growth of 2.5% during fiscal 2009. Other Services revenue decreased organically by 9.7%. The turmoil in the U.S. and Canadian economies significantly affected our Other Services revenue, particularly in the Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services 17 Table of Contents operating segments. The revenue decreases in these operating segments were partially offset by increased revenue in our Document Management Services operating segment. Fiscal 2009 had one fewer workday than fiscal 2008, which resulted in a decrease in revenue of 0.4%. Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products decreased 1.2% compared to fiscal 2008. Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, mops, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost decrease compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by the volume decrease in the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue. The cost decrease due to reduced volume was partially offset by a loss on inventory valuation of $8.4 million, as described above. Cost of other services decreased 1.9% compared to fiscal 2008. Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Document Management Services operating segment. The decrease from fiscal 2008 was due to the volume decrease in Other Services. The cost decrease due to reduced volume was partially offset by a loss on inventory valuation of $19.1 million, as described above. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $21.4 million, or 1.9%, compared to fiscal 2008. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $18.9 million in labor costs and payroll taxes related to our fiscal 2009 cost reduction efforts. Operating income of $409.1 million in fiscal 2009 decreased $168.4 million, or 29.2%, compared to fiscal 2008. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation of $27.5 million and the charges of $59.1 million relating to the restructuring activities, operating income decreased by $81.8 million, or 14.2%, compared to fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes brought on by the turmoil in the U.S. and Canadian economies in fiscal 2009. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased $0.7 million from the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to a $3.3 million reduction in interest income caused by lower interest rates on Canadian treasury securities during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in interest expense caused by lower levels of borrowings in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Income before income tax was $361.6 million, a 31.9% decrease compared to fiscal 2008. This change reflects the decrease in operating income described above. Cintas effective tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2009 as compared to 36.8% and 37.3% for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively (also see Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information on income taxes). Net income for fiscal 2009 of $226.4 million was a 32.5% decrease compared to fiscal 2008, and diluted earnings per share of $1.48 was a 31.2% decrease compared to fiscal 2008. These changes reflect the decrease in operating income described above. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products Operating Segment As discussed above, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue decreased $79.6 million, or 2.8%, and the cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products decreased $19.4 million, or 1.2%. The operating segments gross margin was $1,192.8 million, or 43.3% of revenue. This gross margin percent of revenue of 43.3% decreased from 44.2% in fiscal 2008. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation of $8.4 million in fiscal 2009, the gross margin percent in fiscal 2009 was 43.6%. The decrease of 60 basis points from 44.2% in fiscal 2008 to 43.6% in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to the reduced volume in the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment. 18 Table of Contents Selling and administrative expenses for the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment as a percent to revenue, at 27.9%, decreased 40 basis points from 28.3% in fiscal 2008. This decrease was due to a reduction in labor costs associated with our cost reduction efforts. Income before income taxes decreased $80.7 million to $370.5 million for the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Income before income taxes was 13.4% of this operating segments revenue. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation of $8.4 million and the charges of $53.0 million relating to the restructuring activities, income before income taxes as a percent of revenue was 15.7% in fiscal 2009, which is relatively consistent with the 15.9% in fiscal 2008. Uniform Direct Sales Operating Segment Uniform Direct Sales operating segment revenue decreased $89.1 million for fiscal 2009, a 17.2% decrease compared to fiscal 2008. There were no acquisitions in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment during fiscal 2009. Cost of uniform direct sales decreased $26.9 million, or 7.7%, for fiscal 2009 due to decreased Uniform Direct Sales operating segment volume, partially offset by a loss on inventory valuation of $16.1 million. The gross margin as a percent to revenue of 24.8% for fiscal 2009 decreased from 32.5% in fiscal 2008. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation of $16.1 million in fiscal 2009, the gross margin percent in fiscal 2009 was 28.5%. The decrease from 32.5% in fiscal 2008 to 28.5% in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to the reduced volume. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue, at 22.9%, increased from 20.0% in fiscal 2008. This increase is due to lower volume and an increase in bad debt expense of 70 basis points. Income before income taxes was $3.2 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $61.5 million compared to fiscal 2008. This decrease is primarily due to the reduced volume in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, as well as the loss on inventory valuation of $16.1 million and the charges of $4.6 million relating to the restructuring activities. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation and the charges relating to the restructuring activities, income before income taxes was $24.0 million in fiscal 2009, a decrease of $40.8 million. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services Operating Segment First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment revenue decreased $25.5 million in fiscal 2009, a 6.3% decrease compared to fiscal 2008. This operating segments revenue decreased organically by 7.6%. The turmoil in the U.S. and Canadian economies affected our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment revenue. Our customers in this segment reduced their spending at the onset of the financial crisis in September, 2008, resulting in decreased revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Acquisitions accounted for growth of 1.7%. Fiscal 2009 had one fewer workday than fiscal 2008, which resulted in a decrease in revenue of 0.4%. Cost of first aid, safety and fire protection services decreased $8.8 million, or 3.6%, in fiscal 2009, due to decreased First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment volume, partially offset by a loss on inventory valuation of $3.0 million. Gross margin for the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent to revenue was 38.1% for fiscal 2009. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation of $3.0 million in fiscal 2009, the gross margin percent in fiscal 2009 was 38.9%. The decrease from 39.9% in fiscal 2008 to 38.9% in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to the reduced volume. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue, at 33.6%, increased from 31.0% in fiscal 2008. This increase was due to lower volume and an increase in bad debt expense of 130 basis points. 19 Table of Contents Income before income taxes for the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment was $15.9 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $35.6 million in fiscal 2008. This decrease of $19.7 million was primarily due to the reduced volume in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment, as well as the loss on inventory valuation of $3.0 million and the charges of $1.2 million relating to the restructuring activities. Excluding the loss on inventory valuation and the charges relating to the restructuring activities, income before income taxes was $20.1 million, or 5.3% of revenue, in fiscal 2009 compared to 8.8% of revenue in fiscal 2008. Document Management Services Operating Segment Document Management Services operating segment revenue increased $30.9 million for fiscal 2009, or 17.0% over fiscal 2008. This operating segments internal growth for fiscal 2009 was 6.0% over fiscal 2008. The internal growth is primarily due to the sale of destruction services to new customers, offset by a decline in recycled paper revenue. This operating segment derives revenue from the sale of shredded paper to paper recyclers. The weighted average price of standard office paper, which accounts for the majority of the recycled paper revenue, dropped by 24.2% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Acquisitions accounted for growth of 11.4%. Fiscal 2009 had one fewer workday than fiscal 2008, which resulted in a decrease in revenue of 0.4%. Cost of document management services increased $22.7 million, or 27.4%, for fiscal 2009, due to increased Document Management Services volume. Gross margin for the Document Management Services operating segment is defined as revenue less production and service costs. The gross margin as a percent to revenue was 50.6% for fiscal 2009, down from 54.6% in fiscal 2008. This decrease from fiscal 2008 is mainly due to the sharp decline in recycled paper prices compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in the average price of standard office paper resulted in a decrease in gross margin as a percent to revenue of 2.9%. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue was 41.4% compared to 40.5% in fiscal 2008. This increase is due to the sharp decline in recycled paper prices compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in the average price of standard office paper resulted in an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percent to revenue of 2.4%. Income before income taxes for the Document Management Services operating segment was $19.4 million, a decrease of $6.4 million compared to fiscal 2008. Income before income taxes was 9.1% of the operating segments revenue compared to 14.1% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in the average price of standard paper resulted in a decrease in income before income taxes as a percent to revenue of 14.5%. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2008 total revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of 6.2% over fiscal 2007. Internal growth was 4.6% in fiscal 2008, compared to 5.3% in fiscal 2007. The deterioration in the U.S. and Canadian economies created a challenging environment throughout fiscal 2008. The rising unemployment in the U.S. put pressure on our ability to grow rental uniform wearers, particularly in the latter half of fiscal 2008, as many of our customers reduced their workforces. In addition, our fire protection services business within the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment suffered due to pressure on fire installation system revenue and lower than anticipated recurring service revenue. Our internal growth was generated primarily through the sale of document management services to new and existing customers, continued penetration of our ancillary products and services such as mats, hygiene supplies and restroom cleaning services to existing customers, and first aid and safety products and services to new and existing customers. The remaining growth in total revenue was generated predominantly through acquisitions of rental, first aid, safety and fire protection service businesses and document management businesses. Information related to acquisitions is discussed in Note 10 entitled Acquisitions of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." 20 Table of Contents Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue consists predominantly of revenue derived from the rental of corporate identity uniforms and other garments including flame resistant clothing, and the rental and or sale of mats, mops, shop towels, restroom supplies and other rental services. Revenue from the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment increased 3.7% over fiscal 2007. Internal growth for the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment was 3.4% in fiscal 2008. The increase in the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue was primarily due to growth in the customer base as well as the continued penetration of ancillary products into our existing customer base. New business remained the main driver of our internal growth as we continued to sell rental programs to new customers. We also continued to expand our rental market, with over half of our new business being comprised of customers who were first time users of uniform rental programs. The remaining growth of 0.3% in fiscal 2008 resulted from the acquisition of rental businesses. Other Services revenue, consisting of revenue from the reportable operating segments of Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services, increased 13.5% over fiscal 2007. Internal growth accounted for 8.2% of this increase. This internal growth was generated primarily through the increased sales of first aid, safety and fire protection products and services and document management services to customers. The remaining revenue growth of 5.3% was generated through a combination of acquisitions of first aid, safety and fire protection businesses and document management businesses. Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increased 4.4% over fiscal 2007. Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products consists primarily of production expenses, delivery expenses and the amortization of in service inventory, including uniforms, mats, mops, shop towels and other ancillary items. The cost increase over fiscal 2007 was primarily driven by the growth in the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue. In addition, rising energy costs, especially in the second half of the fiscal year, contributed to this increase. Energy costs increased 11.1% in fiscal 2008, from $104.6 million in fiscal 2007 to $116.2 million in fiscal 2008. Cost of other services increased 10.5% over fiscal 2007. Cost of other services consists primarily of cost of goods sold (predominantly uniforms and first aid products), delivery expenses and distribution expenses in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment, the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment and the Document Management Services operating segment. The increase over fiscal 2007 was due to the growth in other services revenue, derived through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. Rising energy costs also impacted the cost of other services. Other services energy costs increased 35.4% from $18.1 million in fiscal 2007 to $24.5 million in fiscal 2008. Improved leverage and various cost containment programs in our Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services operating segments helped to partially offset the increases in energy costs. Selling and administrative expenses increased 10.0% over fiscal 2007. Selling and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher selling expenses. In fiscal 2007, we reorganized our sales efforts to become more efficient and productive in the long term. This reorganization, as well as increased marketing plans and sales promotions, combined to increase our selling costs by $53.1 million over the prior fiscal year. In addition, administrative expenses increased by $10.4 million due to an increase in legal and other professional services. Operating income of $577.5 million in fiscal 2008, was relatively flat over fiscal 2007. Gross margin increased by $100.2 million, but was offset by the increase of $100.2 million in selling and administrative expenses. Net interest expense (interest expense less interest income) increased $2.9 million from the prior fiscal year. This increase was primarily a result of increased interest expense from additional debt added in fiscal 2008 used to buyback shares under our share buyback program. 21  Table of Contents Income before income taxes was $530.7 million, a 0.5% decrease over fiscal 2007. This change reflects the relatively flat operating income being reduced by the higher net interest expense. Cintas effective tax rate was 36.8% for fiscal 2008 as compared to 37.3% for fiscal 2007 (see also Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"). Net income for fiscal 2008 of $335.4 million was a 0.3% increase over fiscal 2007, and diluted earnings per share of $2.15 was a 2.9% increase over fiscal 2007. The increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the impact of the share buyback program, which is discussed in more detail in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products Operating Segment As discussed above, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment revenue increased $99.9 million, or 3.7%, and the cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products increased $66.4 million, or 4.4%. The operating segments gross margin was $1,253.0 million, or 44.2% of revenue. This gross margin percent of revenue of 44.2% decreased from the 44.6% in fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of an 11.1% increase in energy costs. Selling and administrative expenses for the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment as a percent to sales, at 28.3%, increased 60 basis points from the 27.7% in the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to the increased investment in our sales organization and increases in our marketing efforts and sales promotions as described above. Income before income taxes decreased $11.1 million to $451.3 million for the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Income before income taxes was 15.9% of this operating segments revenue, which is a 100 basis point decrease compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of the increased energy costs and the increased investment in our sales organization and increases in our marketing efforts and sales promotions. Uniform Direct Sales Operating Segment Uniform Direct Sales operating segment revenue increased $16.0 million for fiscal 2008, a 3.2% increase over fiscal 2007. There were no acquisitions in the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment during fiscal 2008. Cost of uniform direct sales increased $8.5 million, or 2.5%, for fiscal 2008 due to increased Uniform Direct Sales operating segment volume. The gross margin as a percent to revenue was 32.5% for fiscal 2008, which was a 50 basis point improvement over the prior fiscal year. This improvement is due to both sourcing improvements for catalog products as well as the increased sales volume. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue, at 20.0%, increased 60 basis points compared to fiscal 2007. This increase is in part due to the catalog costs associated with the introduction of the new "Uniform Book" and new healthcare catalog. Income before income taxes increased $1.5 million to $64.8 million for the Uniform Direct Sales operating segment for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Income before income taxes was 12.5% of the operating segments revenue, which is a 10 basis point decrease compared to fiscal 2007. This decrease is primarily due to the increased catalog costs noted above, offset by the gross margin improvements due to sourcing improvements and increased sales volume. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services Operating Segment First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment revenue increased $41.1 million for fiscal 2008, an 11.4% increase over fiscal 2007. This operating segments internal growth for fiscal 2008 was 6.1% over the prior fiscal year. The operating segments internal growth was negatively impacted by lower than anticipated fire 22 Table of Contents suppression system installation revenue and lower than anticipated recurring service revenue within the fire protection services business. Internal growth was generated primarily by the sale of first aid and safety products and services to new customers. The remaining growth was generated through the acquisition of first aid, safety and fire protection businesses. Cost of first aid, safety and fire protection services increased $24.8 million, or 11.4%, for fiscal 2008, due to increased First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment volume. Gross margin for the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment is defined as revenue less cost of goods, warehouse expenses, service expenses and training expenses. The gross margin as a percent to revenue was 39.9% for fiscal 2008, which is consistent with the prior fiscal year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue, at 31.0%, increased 170 basis points compared to fiscal 2007. This increase was due to the increased investment in our sales organization and increases in our marketing efforts and sales promotions as described above. Income before income taxes for the First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment decreased by $2.6 million in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Income before income taxes was 8.8% of the operating segments revenue, which is a 180 basis point decrease compared to last fiscal year primarily as a result of the increased investment in our sales organization and increases in our marketing efforts and sales promotions. Document Management Services Operating Segment Document Management Services operating segment revenue increased $73.9 million for fiscal 2008, or 68.1% over the prior fiscal year. This operating segments internal growth for fiscal 2008 was 38.2% over fiscal 2007. The internal growth is primarily due to the sale of destruction services to new customers. The remaining growth was generated through the acquisition of document management businesses. Cost of document management services increased $31.1 million, or 60.2%, for fiscal 2008, due to increased Document Management Services operating segment volume. Gross margin for the Document Management Services operating segment is defined as revenue less production and service costs. The gross margin as a percent to revenue was 54.6% for fiscal 2008, which is a 220 basis point improvement over the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007. This improvement is primarily due to the operating segments increased sales volume and favorable recycled paper prices relative to the prior fiscal year. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent to revenue was 40.5% compared to 45.7% in fiscal 2007. This decrease is due to better leveraging of administrative functions resulting from the operating segments increased sales volume, partially offset by the increased investment in our sales organization and increases in our marketing efforts and sales promotions. Income before income taxes for the Document Management Services operating segment increased $18.6 million for fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Income before income taxes was 14.1% of the operating segments revenue compared to 6.6% in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of the operating segments increased sales volume. Liquidity and Capital Resources At May 31, 2009, Cintas had $250.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, representing an increase of $58.4 million, or 30.5% from May 31, 2008. This increase is attributable to the improvement in net working capital and lower use of cash for financing and investing activities. Net working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) increased by $37.7 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Cash used for investing and financing activities decreased by $56.1 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Cash generated from operations was $523.5 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $542.7 million generated in fiscal 2008. This $19.2 million decrease is a result of lower income during the current fiscal year offset by improvements in working 23 Table of Contents capital. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2009 were capital expenditures of $160.1 million, net repayment of long term debt of $157.1 million and dividends of $72.2 million. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be used to finance future acquisitions and capital expenditures. Marketable securities consist primarily of Canadian treasury securities. Cintas believes that its investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative. The criterion used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal, while earning an attractive yield. Accounts receivable decreased $72.4 million, primarily due to decreased revenue. The average collection period in fiscal 2009 remained comparable with fiscal 2008. Inventories and uniforms and other rental items in service decreased $71.3 million, or 11.7% due to a $27.5 million reduction of inventory related to the loss on inventory valuation and due to an overall reduction in inventory levels in response to customer demands driven by the current economic environment. Working capital increased $37.7 million to $952.8 million in fiscal 2009, due to the increased cash balances discussed above offset by reductions in accounts receivable and inventory levels. Net property and equipment decreased $59.9 million due to normal ongoing property and equipment activity and the impact of the restructuring activities, including the categorization of $15.7 million in assets held for sale. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 totaled $160.1 million, including $114.4 million for the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment and $22.8 million for the Document Management Services operating segment, exceeding depreciation expense by $2.5 million. Included in the overall capital expenditure figure and in some of the operating segment data are approximately $43 million of costs related to information technology capital projects, including implementation costs of an enterprise computer system. During fiscal 2009, Cintas completed construction of three new uniform rental facilities. Long term debt totaled $786.7 million at May 31, 2009. This amount includes $225.0 million of 10 year senior notes at a rate of 6.0% issued in fiscal 2002, $250.0 million of 30 year senior notes issued in fiscal 2006 at a rate of 6.15% and $300.0 million of 10 year senior notes issued in fiscal 2008 at a rate of 6.125%. Cintas has earned credit ratings on these notes of "A" from Standard & Poors and "A2" from Moodys. Cintas utilizes a $600.0 million commercial paper program, on which it has earned credit ratings of "A 1" from Standard & Poors and "Prime 1" from Moodys. We believe these ratings are reflective of our commitment to conservative financial policies, strong financial management and a disciplined integration strategy for acquisitions. The commercial paper program is fully supported by a long term credit facility that matures in fiscal 2011. As of May 31, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. During fiscal 2009, Cintas initiated a $7.5 million loan with PIDC Regional Center, LP for funding related to a facility being built in Philadelphia. It is a 5 year note with a 2.75% interest rate. Cintas total debt to capitalization ratio has decreased from 29.5% at May 31, 2008, to 24.9% at May 31, 2009. Total debt decreased $157.2 million in fiscal 2009 through the use of cash generated by operations to reduce commercial paper balances. During fiscal 2009, Cintas paid dividends of $72.2 million, or $0.47 per share. On a per share basis, this dividend is an increase of 2.2% over the dividend paid in fiscal 2008. This marks the 26th consecutive year that Cintas has increased its annual dividend, every year since going public in 1983. On May 2, 2005, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $500.0 million share buyback program at market prices. In July 2006, Cintas announced that the Board of Directors approved the expansion of its share buyback program by an additional $500.0 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Cintas purchased 0.9 million shares of Cintas stock at an average price of $28.61 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $26 million. From the inception of the share buyback program through July 30, 2009, Cintas has purchased 24 Table of Contents 20.3 million shares of Cintas common stock at an average price of $39.31 per share for a total purchase price of approximately $798 million. The Board of Directors did not specify an expiration date for this program. Following is information regarding Cintas long term contractual obligations and other commitments outstanding as of May 31, 2009: Long Term Contractual Obligations (In thousands) Payments Due by Period Total One year or less Two to three years Four to five years After five years Long term debt (1) $ 786,627 $ 569 $ 1,256 $ 233,823 $ 550,979 Capital lease obligations (2) 29 29 Operating leases (3) 95,954 27,329 39,753 18,033 10,839 Interest payments (4) 652,577 49,563 98,977 71,228 432,809 Interest swap agreements Unconditional purchase obligations Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,535,187 $ 77,490 $ 139,986 $ 323,084 $ 994,627 Cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans. The amounts of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are made at the discretion of Cintas. Future contributions are expected to increase approximately 3% to 5% annually. Based on that increase, payments due in one year or less would be $25,221, two to three years would be $54,287 and four to five years would be $59,852. Payments for years thereafter are expected to continue increasing by approximately 5% each year. (1)Long term debt primarily consists of $775,000 in senior notes. Reference Note 7 entitled Long Term Debt of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a detailed discussion of long term debt. (2)Capital lease obligations are included in long term debt detailed in Note 7 entitled Long Term Debt of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." (3)Operating leases consist primarily of building leases and a synthetic lease on a corporate aircraft. (4)Interest payments include interest on both fixed and variable rate debt. Rates have been assumed to increase 25 basis points in fiscal 2010, increase 75 basis points for both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, increase 100 basis points in fiscal 2013, increase 50 basis points in fiscal 2014 and increase an additional 50 basis points in each year thereafter.

(2)Support certain outstanding debt (reference Note 7 entitled Long Term Debt of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"), self insured workers compensation and general liability insurance programs. 25 Table of Contents Cintas has no off balance sheet arrangements other than the synthetic lease on a corporate aircraft. The synthetic lease on the aircraft does not currently have, and is not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on Cintas financial condition, changes in Cintas financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operation, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Inflation and Changing Prices Changes in wages, benefits and energy costs have the potential to materially impact Cintas financial results. Medical benefit costs increased as a percent to revenue due to increased utilization and rising healthcare industry costs. Medical benefits were 3.5% of total revenue in fiscal 2009 and 3.1% of total revenue in fiscal 2008. Management believes inflation has not had a material impact on Cintas financial condition or a negative impact on results of operation. Litigation and Other Contingencies Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary course of business actions will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operation of Cintas. Cintas is party to additional litigation not considered in the ordinary course of business. Please refer to "Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 14 entitled Litigation and Other Contingencies of "Part II, Item 8. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a detailed discussion of certain specific litigation. New Accounting Standards Effective June 1, 2008, Cintas adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. FASB Staff Position 157 2 delayed the effective date of FAS 157 for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). For all non financial assets and liabilities, FAS 157 is effective for Cintas beginning June 1, 2009. The adoption of FAS 157 for our financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on Cintas results of operation or financial condition. Cintas adoption of FAS 157 is more fully described in Note 3 entitled Fair Value Measurements of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Cintas does not believe that the adoption of FAS 157 with respect to non financial assets and liabilities will materially impact its financial position and results of operation. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (FAS 141(R)). Under FAS 141(R), an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date. It further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred, restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date, and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense. For Cintas, FAS 141(R) is effective for acquisitions and adjustments to an acquired entitys deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after May 31, 2009. The adoption of FAS 141(R) will have an impact on Cintas consolidated financial statements when effective, but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of Cintas consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These critical accounting policies should be read in conjunction with Note 1 entitled Significant Accounting Policies of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Significant changes, estimates or assumptions related to any of the following critical accounting policies could possibly have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Revenue recognition Rental revenue, which is recorded in the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, is recognized when services are performed. Other services revenue, which is recorded in the Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services operating segments, is recognized when either services are performed or when products are shipped and the title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. Allowance for doubtful accounts Cintas establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance includes an estimate based on historical rates of collectability and allowances for specific accounts identified as uncollectible. The allowance that is an estimate based on historical rates of collectability is recorded for overdue amounts, beginning with a nominal percentage and increasing substantially as the account ages. The amount provided as the account ages will differ slightly between the Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment and the three other operating segments because of differences in customers served and the nature of each operating segment. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out) or market. Substantially all inventories represent finished goods. Cintas applies a commonly accepted practice of using inventory turns to apply variances between actual and standard costs to the inventory balances. The judgments and estimates used to calculate inventory turns will have an impact on the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market. An inventory obsolescence reserve is determined by specific identification, as well as an estimate based on historical rates of obsolescence. The significant deterioration of the U.S. and Canadian economies, particularly in the last five months of the year ended May 31, 2009, led to reduced revenue in our Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment, our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment and our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment, which created excess inventory amounts in these operating segments. As a result, we reduced the carrying amount of specific inventory to realizable values and recorded a pre tax loss in the year ended May 31, 2009, of $27.5 million. The following summarizes this amount by operating segment: (In millions) May 31, 2009 Rental Uniforms & Ancillary Products Uniform Direct Sales First Aid, Safety & Fire Protection Document Management Total Cost of rental uniforms and ancillary products $ 8.4 $ $ $ $ 8.4 Cost of other services 16.1 3.0 19.1 Loss on inventory valuation $ 8.4 $ 16.1 $ 3.0 $ $ 27.5 Uniforms and other rental items in service Uniforms and other rental items in service are valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight line method. Uniforms in service (other than cleanroom and flame resistant clothing) are amortized over their useful life 27 Table of Contents of 18 months. Other rental items including shop towels, mats, cleanroom garments, flame resistant clothing, linens and restroom dispensers are amortized over their useful lives which range from 8 to 48 months. The amortization rates used are based on industry experience, Cintas specific experience and wear tests performed by Cintas. These factors are critical to determining the amount of in service inventory that is presented in the consolidated financial statements. Property and equipment Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically 30 to 40 years for buildings, 5 to 20 years for building improvements, 3 to 10 years for equipment and 2 to 15 years for leasehold improvements. When events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss is recorded based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values. Fair value is generally determined by discounted cash flows or based on prices of similar assets, as appropriate. Long lived assets that are held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less estimated costs to sell. See Note 2 entitled Restructuring and Related Activity of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for discussion of impairment of long lived assets. Goodwill and impairment Goodwill, obtained through acquisitions of businesses, is valued at cost less any impairment. Cintas performs annual impairment tests by operating segment. These tests include comparisons to current market values, where available, and discounted cash flow analyses. Significant assumptions include growth rates based on historical trends and margin improvement leveraged from such growth. Based on the results of the impairment tests, Cintas has not recognized an impairment of goodwill for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. Service contracts and other assets Service contracts and other assets, which consist primarily of noncompete and consulting agreements obtained through acquisitions of businesses, are amortized by use of the straight line method over the estimated lives of the agreements, which are generally 5 to 10 years. Certain noncompete agreements, as well as all service contracts, require that a valuation be determined using a discounted cash flow model. The assumptions and judgments used in these models involve estimates of cash flows and discount rates, among other factors. Because of the assumptions used to value these intangible assets, actual results over time could vary from original estimates. Impairment of service contracts and other assets is accomplished through specific identification. No impairment has been recognized by Cintas for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. Stock based compensation As required under FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments to employees, including stock options, in the consolidated statements of income based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Measured compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related share based compensation award. See Note 13 entitled Stock Based Compensation of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further information. Litigation and environmental matters Cintas is subject to legal proceedings and claims related to environmental matters arising from the ordinary course of business. U.S. GAAP requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine 28 Table of Contents the existence of a liability, as well as the amount to be recorded. While a significant change in assumptions and judgments could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for contingent liabilities, Cintas does not believe that they will result in a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements. A detailed discussion of litigation matters is discussed above in the section entitled Litigation and Other Contingencies. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by the differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. See Note 9 entitled Income Taxes of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for the types of items that give rise to significant deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are classified as assets or liabilities based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes that are not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting are classified according to the expected reversal date. Cintas regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. As a result of this review, Cintas has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. Cintas is periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions, Cintas records reserves as deemed appropriate. Based on Cintas evaluation of current tax positions, Cintas believes its accruals are appropriate.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Cintas manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable and fixed rate debt and investing in marketable securities. Earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates due to investments in marketable securities and money market accounts and periodic issuances of commercial paper. If short term rates changed by one half percent (or 50 basis points), Cintas income before income taxes would change by approximately $0.5 million. This estimated exposure considers the effects on investments and the change in the cost of variable rate debt. This analysis does not consider the effects of a change in economic activity or a change in Cintas capital structure. Through its foreign operations, Cintas is exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into U.S. dollars. Foreign denominated revenue and profit represents less than 10% of Cintas consolidated revenue and profit. Cintas periodically uses foreign currency hedges such as average rate options and forward contracts to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements resulting from foreign currency revenue and from international cash flows. The primary foreign currency to which Cintas is exposed is the Canadian dollar. 29  Table of Contents
