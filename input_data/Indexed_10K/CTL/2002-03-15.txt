Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Overview CenturyTel, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") is a regional integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange, wireless, long distance, Internet access and data services to customers in 21 states. On July 31, 2000 and September 29, 2000, affiliates of the Company acquired over 490,000 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets in Arkansas, Missouri and Wisconsin from affiliates of Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon") for an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion cash. The operations of these acquired properties are included in the Companys results of operations beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. See Acquisitions and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On May 14, 1999, the Company sold substantially all of its Alaska based operations serving approximately 134,900 telephone access lines and 3,000 cellular subscribers. On June 1, 1999, the Company sold the assets of its Brownsville and McAllen, Texas cellular operations serving approximately 7,500 cellular subscribers. In February 2000, the Company sold the assets of its remaining Alaska cellular operations serving approximately 10,600 cellular subscribers. The operations of these disposed properties are included in the Companys results of operations up to the respective dates of disposition. During the three years ended December 31, 2001, the Company has acquired and sold various other operations, the impact of which has not been material to the financial position or results of operations of the Company. The net income of the Company for 2001 was $343.0 million, compared to $231.5 million during 2000 and $239.8 million during 1999. Diluted earnings per share for 2001 were $2.41 compared to $1.63 in 2000 and $1.70 in 1999. Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income Telephone $ 423,420 376,290 351,559 Wireless 112,401 117,865 133,930 Other 22,098 31,258 22,580 557,919 525,413 508,069 Nonrecurring gains and losses, net 199,971 20,593 62,808 Interest expense (225,523) (183,302) (150,557) Income from unconsolidated cellular entities 27,460 26,986 27,675 Minority interest (11,812) (10,201) (27,913) Other income and expense 5,041 6,696 9,190 Income tax expense (210,025) (154,711) (189,503) Net income $ 343,031 231,474 239,769 Basic earnings per share $ 2.43 1.65 1.72 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41 1.63 1.70 Average basic shares outstanding 140,743 140,069 138,848 Average diluted shares outstanding 142,307 141,864 141,432 During the three years ended December 31, 2001, the Company has recorded certain nonrecurring items. Net income (and diluted earnings per share) excluding nonrecurring items for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $225.7 million ($1.59), $228.8 million ($1.61), and $238.3 million ($1.69), respectively. The following reconciliation table shows how the amounts of various line items reported under generally accepted accounting principles were impacted by these nonrecurring items.

Contributions to operating revenues and operating income by the Companys telephone, wireless and other operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2001 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Operating revenues Telephone operations 71.1% 67.9 67.2 Wireless operations 20.7% 24.0 25.2 Other operations 8.2% 8.1 7.6 Operating income Telephone operations 75.9% 71.6 69.2 Wireless operations 20.1% 22.4 26.4 Other operations 4.0% 6.0 4.4 In August 2001, the Company announced that it is exploring the potential separation of its wireless business from its other operations. In addition to historical information, managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results and financial position. Such forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from such statements. Such uncertainties include but are not limited to: the Companys ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly acquired businesses into the Companys operations, successfully financing and timely consummating pending acquisitions, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; the results of the Companys effort to separate its wireless operations; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the telecommunications industry; the effects of greater than anticipated competition in the Companys markets; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Companys products and services; the Companys ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in general market or economic conditions or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the business are described in greater detail in Item 1 to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward looking statements for any reason. Telephone Operations The Company conducts its telephone operations in rural, suburban and small urban communities in 21 states. As of December 31, 2001, approximately 87% of the Companys 1.8 million access lines were in Wisconsin, Arkansas, Washington, Missouri, Michigan, Louisiana, Colorado, Ohio, and Oregon. The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys telephone operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Local service $ 491,529 408,538 353,534 Network access 874,458 727,797 654,003 Other 139,746 117,634 118,575 1,505,733 1,253,969 1,126,112 Operating expenses Plant operations 380,466 290,062 251,704 Customer operations 117,080 105,950 88,552 Corporate and other 186,483 163,761 160,631 Depreciation and amortization 398,284 317,906 273,666 1,082,313 877,679 774,553 Operating income $ 423,420 376,290 351,559 Local service revenues. Local service revenues are derived from the monthly provision of local exchange telephone services in the Companys service areas. Of the $83.0 million (20.3%) increase in local service revenues in 2001, $73.7 million was due to the acquisition of the Verizon properties in 2000. The remaining $9.3 million increase was due to a $6.9 million increase due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions and an increase in the average number of customer access lines in incumbent markets and a $3.9 million increase due to the increased provision of custom calling features. Of the $55.0 million (15.6%) increase in local service revenues in 2000, $46.5 million was due to the acquisition of the Verizon properties, which was partially offset by a $14.4 million decrease attributable to the sale of the Companys Alaska based operations in the second quarter of 1999. The remaining $22.9 million increase was due to a $16.4 million increase in the average number of customer access lines in incumbent markets and a $5.4 million increase due to the increased provision of custom calling features. Access lines declined 0.2% during 2001. Internal access line growth during 2000 and 1999 was 2.8% and 4.8%, respectively. The decline in internal access line growth during 2001 is substantially due to the slowing growth in the Companys service areas due to general economic conditions and disconnecting customers for nonpayment. Network access revenues. Network access revenues are primarily derived from charges to long distance companies and other customers for access to the Companys local exchange carrier ("LEC") networks in connection with the completion of interstate or intrastate long distance telephone calls. Certain of the Companys interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues increased $146.7 million (20.2%) in 2001 and $73.8 million (11.3%) in 2000 due to the following factors: 2001 2000 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Acquisitions of Verizon properties in third quarter 2000 $ 139,866 75,938 Increased recovery from the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") 8,507 15,753 Disposition of Alaska properties (23,348) Partial recovery of increased operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, increased minutes of use, increased recovery from state support funds and return on rate base 13,204 3,637 Revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements (16,876) 4,228 Other, net 1,960 (2,414) $ 146,661 73,794 Other revenues. Other revenues include revenues related to (i) leasing, selling, installing, maintaining and repairing customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring ("CPE services"), (ii) providing billing and collection services for long distance carriers and (iii) participating in the publication of local directories. Other revenues increased $22.1 million in 2001, primarily due to a $20.5 million increase attributable to revenues contributed by the Verizon properties. The remainder of the increase in 2001 was due primarily to a $7.0 million increase in revenues from CPE services (primarily due to an increase in rates) which was partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in billing and collection revenues. Other revenues decreased $941,000 in 2000, primarily due to a $6.3 million decrease due to the sale of the Alaska properties and a $5.4 million decrease from the provision of CPE services, which benefited in 1999 from sales to customers readying their equipment for the Year 2000. Such decreases were substantially offset by a $10.8 million increase attributable to revenues contributed by the Verizon properties. Operating expenses. Plant operations expenses during 2001 and 2000 increased $90.4 million (31.2%) and $38.4 million (15.2%), respectively. Of the $90.4 million increase in 2001, $87.3 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon. The remaining $3.1 million increase was primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $2.7 million increase in network operations expenses and a $2.6 million increase in digital subscriber line ("DSL") expenses. Such increases were substantially offset by a $9.9 million decrease in engineering expenses. Of the $38.4 million increase in 2000, $44.8 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon, which was partially offset by a $13.0 million decrease due to the sale of the Alaska properties. The remaining $6.6 million increase was primarily due to a $4.7 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $2.4 million increase in network operations and engineering expenses. Customer operations, corporate and other expenses increased $33.9 million (12.6%) in 2001 and $20.5 million (8.2%) in 2000. Of the $33.9 million increase in 2001, $42.5 million related to the Verizon properties. The remaining $8.6 million decrease in 2001 was primarily due to a $4.3 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and a $3.1 million decrease in operating taxes. Of the $20.5 million increase in 2000, $34.0 million related to the Verizon properties, which was partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease due to the sale of the Alaska properties in 1999. The remaining $2.1 million decrease in 2000 was primarily due to a $5.6 million decrease in contract labor expenses primarily associated with nonrecurring costs incurred in 1999 attributable to readying the Companys system to be Year 2000 compliant and an $8.2 million decrease in operating taxes. Such decreases were partially offset by a $7.7 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts and a $2.4 million increase in information technology expenses. Depreciation and amortization increased $80.4 million (25.3%) and $44.2 million (16.2%) in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Of the $80.4 million increase in 2001, $65.2 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon (which included $14.7 million of amortization of goodwill) and the remainder was primarily due to higher levels of plant in service. Of the $44.2 million increase in 2000, $44.6 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon (which included $8.5 million of amortization of goodwill) and $11.8 million was primarily due to higher levels of plant in service. Such increases were partially offset by a $10.6 million reduction resulting from the sale of the Companys Alaska properties. Exclusive of acquisitions, depreciation expense included nonrecurring additional depreciation charges approved by regulators in certain jurisdictions which aggregated $4.1 million in 2000. The composite depreciation rate for the Companys regulated telephone properties, including the additional depreciation charges, was 6.8% for 2001, 7.2% for 2000 and 7.0% for 1999. Other.

Wireless Operations and Income from Unconsolidated Cellular Entities Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Dollars in thousands) Operating income wireless operations $ 112,401 117,865 133,930 Minority interest wireless operations, exclusive of the effect of asset sales in 1999 (11,510) (11,598) (12,911) Income from unconsolidated cellular entities 27,460 26,986 27,675 $ 128,351 133,253 148,694 The Companys wireless operations (discussed below) reflect 100% of the results of operations of the cellular entities in which the Company has a majority ownership interest. The minority interest owners share of the income of such entities is reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income as an expense in "Minority interest." See Minority Interest for additional information. The Companys share of earnings from the cellular entities in which it has less than a majority interest is accounted for using the equity method and is reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income in "Income from unconsolidated cellular entities." See Income from Unconsolidated Cellular Entities for additional information. Wireless Operations All of the Companys wireless operations are located in Michigan, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas. The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys wireless operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Service $ 336,850 328,956 305,006 Roaming 90,192 99,791 106,486 Equipment sales 10,923 14,822 10,777 437,965 443,569 422,269 Operating expenses Cost of equipment sold 23,453 30,064 21,408 System operations 75,628 69,641 56,866 General, administrative and customer service 85,467 78,087 79,569 Sales and marketing 74,670 82,673 61,903 Depreciation and amortization 66,346 65,239 68,593 325,564 325,704 288,339 Operating income $ 112,401 117,865 133,930 Operating revenues. Service revenues include monthly service fees for providing access and airtime to customers and toll revenue. Roaming revenues include service fees for providing airtime to other carriers customers roaming through the Companys service areas. The $7.9 million increase in service revenues in 2001 was due primarily to an increase in the number of customers and increased minutes of use per customer, both of which were partially offset by reduced rates. The $9.6 million decrease in roaming revenues in 2001 was due to a reduction in roaming rates (which was partially offset by an increase in roaming minutes of use), a downward trend in rates that the Company anticipates will continue in the near future. Of the $24.0 million increase in service revenues in 2000, $31.6 million was due to growth in the number of customers and increased minutes of use per customer, both of which were partially offset by reduced rates. Such increase was partially offset by an $8.0 million decrease due to the sale of the Texas and Alaska cellular properties. Of the $6.7 million decrease in roaming revenues in 2000, $3.2 million was due to a reduction in roaming rates (which was partially offset by an increase in roaming minutes of use). The remainder of the decrease in roaming revenues in 2000 was due to the sale of the Texas and Alaska cellular properties in mid 1999. The following table illustrates the growth in the Companys wireless customer base in its majority owned markets: Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 Customers at beginning of period 751,200 707,486 624,290 Gross units added internally 316,353 339,247 240,084 Disconnects 270,213 284,880 146,325 Net units added internally 46,140 54,367 93,759 Effect of property dispositions (10,653) (10,563) Customers at end of period 797,340 751,200 707,486 Average monthly churn rate (excluding prepaid customers) 2.33% 1.95% 2.02% The average monthly revenue (excluding equipment sales) per customer declined to $46 during 2001 from $49 in 2000 and $53 in 1999 primarily due to reductions in service rates charged to the Companys customers and reductions in roaming rates charged to other cellular operators. The average monthly revenue per customer is expected to further decline (i) as competitive pressures (including those causing further reductions in service rates) from current and future wireless communications providers intensify and (ii) as the Company continues to receive pressure from other cellular operators to reduce roaming rates. The Company is responding to such competitive pressures by, among other things, modifying certain of its price plans and implementing certain other plans and promotions, some of which are likely to result in lower average revenue per customer. During 2001 the Company added approximately 47,700 net contract customers while the prepaid customer base declined by 1,560 customers. The Company will continue to focus on adding contract customers while decreasing its focus on prepaid plans for future customer growth. At December 31, 2001, over 90% of the Companys wireless customers were contract customers. Operating expenses. Cost of equipment sold decreased $6.6 million (22.0%) in 2001 primarily due to a decrease in the number of phones sold and a decrease in the average cost per unit. Cost of equipment sold increased $8.7 million (40.4%) in 2000 primarily due to an increase in the number of phones sold and an increase in average cost per unit primarily due to a higher percentage of digital phones sold. System operations expenses increased $6.0 million (8.6%) in 2001 primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in network costs and cell site expenses associated with operating a greater number of cell sites and a $3.3 million increase in the net amounts paid to other carriers for service provided to the Companys customers who roam in the other carriers service areas. Such increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in toll costs. System operations expenses increased $12.8 million (22.5%) in 2000 primarily due to a $5.9 million increase associated with operating a greater number of cell sites and a $4.5 million increase in the net amounts paid to other carriers for service provided to the Companys customers who roam in the other carriers service areas. Exclusive of cell sites in its PCS markets, the Company operated 739 cell sites at December 31, 2001 in entities in which it had a majority interest, compared to 667 at December 31, 2000 and 639 at December 31, 1999. General, administrative and customer service expenses increased $7.4 million (9.5%) in 2001, of which $3.7 million was due to an increase in customer service and retention costs and $2.0 million was attributable to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. General, administrative and customer service expenses decreased $1.5 million (1.9%) in 2000, of which $3.3 million was attributable to a decrease in operating taxes and $1.5 million was due to the sale of the Alaska and Texas properties. Such decreases were partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. Sales and marketing expenses decreased $8.0 million (9.7%) in 2001 due primarily to a $2.8 million decrease in advertising and sales promotion expenses; a $2.1 million decrease in sales commissions paid to agents due to a decrease in the number of units sold; and a $1.1 million decrease in costs associated with operating a fewer number of retail locations. Sales and marketing expenses increased $20.8 million (33.6%) in 2000 due primarily to an $8.6 million increase in advertising and sales promotion expenses; a $5.2 million increase in sales commissions paid to agents due to an increase in the number of units sold; and a $4.2 million increase in costs incurred in selling products and services in retail locations primarily due to an increase in the number of retail locations. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.1 million in 2001 primarily due to a higher level of plant in service. Depreciation and amortization decreased $3.4 million (4.9%) in 2000, primarily due to the sale of the Alaska and Texas properties. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact the Companys wireless operations, see Regulation and Competition. Other Operations Other operations includes the results of operations of subsidiaries of the Company which are not included in the telephone or wireless segments including, but not limited to, the Companys non regulated long distance operations, Internet operations, call center operations (which ceased operations in the third quarter of 2000), competitive local exchange carrier ("CLEC") operations, fiber network business and security monitoring operations. The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys other operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2001 2000 1999 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Long distance $ 117,363 104,435 83,087 Internet 39,057 23,491 16,818 Other 17,351 20,462 28,383 173,771 148,388 128,288 Operating expenses Cost of sales and operating expenses 142,919 112,219 99,151 Depreciation and amortization 8,754 4,911 6,557 151,673 117,130 105,708 Operating income $ 22,098 31,258 22,580 Long distance revenues increased $12.9 million (12.4%) and $21.3 million (25.7%) in 2001 and 2000, respectively, due primarily to the growth in the number of customers and increased minutes of use, primarily due to penetration of the Verizon markets acquired in 2000. The number of long distance customers as of December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999 was 465,870, 363,300, and 303,700, respectively. Internet revenues increased $15.6 million (66.3%) in 2001 primarily due to a $12.6 million increase due to growth in the number of customers (including growth in the Companys DSL product offering) and a $1.8 million increase due to Internet operations acquired in mid 2000. Internet revenues increased $6.7 million (39.7%) in 2000 primarily due to a $6.9 million increase due to growth in the number of customers and a $1.4 million increase due to Internet operations acquired in late 1999 and mid 2000. Such increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease due to the sale of the Companys Alaska Internet operations in mid 1999. Other revenues declined $3.1 million and $7.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, primarily due to the planned phase out of the Companys third party call center operations during 2000. Cost of sales and operating expenses increased $30.7 million (27.4%) in 2001 primarily due to (i) a $23.5 million increase in expenses related to the provision of Internet access primarily due to the expansion of the Companys DSL product offering, (ii) an increase of $9.3 million in expenses of the Companys long distance operations primarily due to an increase in the number of customers and an increase in marketing expenses, and (iii) an $8.3 million increase due to the expansion of the Companys CLEC business. Such increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million reduction in expenses due to the winding down of the Companys third party call center operations during 2000. Cost of sales and operating expenses during 2000 increased $13.1 million (13.2%) primarily due to an increase of $12.3 million in expenses of the Companys long distance operations primarily due to increased minutes of use due to an increase in the number of customers which was partially offset by reduced rates; a $9.8 million increase in expenses associated with expanding the Companys Internet operations and a $3.4 million increase in expenses primarily due to start up costs of the Companys CLEC business. Such increases were partially offset by a $9.0 million reduction in expenses due to winding down the Companys third party call center operations during 2000 and a $2.4 million decrease due to the 1999 sale of the Companys Alaska Internet operations. Depreciation and amortization increased $3.8 million in 2001 primarily due to increased depreciation expense in the Companys Internet and fiber network businesses. Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.6 million in 2000 primarily due to the write down of assets of the call center operations to estimated net realizable value in 1999. The Company incurred combined operating losses in 2001 of $16.5 million in its CLEC and fiber network businesses and expects to incur a combined operating loss ranging from $15 to $20 million in 2002 related to these operations. Certain of the Companys service subsidiaries provide managerial, operational, technical, accounting and administrative services, along with materials and supplies, to the Companys telephone subsidiaries. In accordance with regulatory accounting, intercompany profit on transactions with regulated affiliates has not been eliminated in connection with consolidating the results of operations of the Company. When the regulated operations of the Company no longer qualify for the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"), such intercompany profit will be eliminated in subsequent financial statements, the primary result of which will be a decrease in operating expenses applicable to the Companys telephone operations and an increase in operating expenses applicable to the Companys other operations. The amount of intercompany profit with regulated affiliates which was not eliminated was approximately $22.0 million, $17.1 million and $14.0 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. For additional information applicable to SFAS 71, see Regulation and Competition Other Matters and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NONRECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES, NET In 2001, the Companys aggregate favorable nonrecurring gains and losses were $200.0 million. The Company recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $185.1 million ($117.7 million after tax; $.83 per diluted share) due to the sale of 30 PCS licenses to Leap Wireless International, Inc. ("Leap"). In conjunction with the sale of licenses to Leap, the Company also recorded a pre tax charge of $18.2 million ($11.6 million after tax; $.08 per share) due to the write down in the value of certain non operating assets. Also during 2001, the Company recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of its remaining shares of Illuminet Holdings, Inc. ("Illuminet") common stock aggregating $54.6 million ($35.5 million after tax; $.25 per diluted share) and a pre tax gain of $4.0 million ($2.6 million after tax; $.02 per diluted share) on the sale of certain other assets. Additionally in 2001, the Company recorded pre tax charges of $25.5 million ($16.6 million after tax; $.12 per diluted share) due to the write down in the value of certain non operating investments in which the Company owns a minority interest. In 2000, the Company recorded pre tax gains aggregating $20.6 million. Approximately $9.9 million ($5.2 million after tax; $.04 per diluted share) was due to the sale of the assets of the Companys remaining Alaska cellular operations and approximately $10.7 million ($6.4 million after tax; $.05 per diluted share) was due to the sale of the Companys minority interest in a non strategic cellular partnership. In 1999, the Company recorded pre tax gains aggregating $62.8 million. Approximately $39.6 million of the pre tax gains ($7.8 million after tax loss; $.05 per diluted share) was due to the sale of the Companys Brownsville and McAllen, Texas cellular properties. Approximately $10.4 million of the pre tax gains ($6.7 million after tax; $.04 per diluted share) was due to the sale of the Companys remaining common shares of MCIWorldCom, Inc. The remainder of the gains in 1999 was primarily due to an $11.6 million pre tax gain ($7.6 million after tax; $.05 per diluted share) due to the sale of the Companys shares of common stock of Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. Certain other nonrecurring items for the three year period ended December 31, 2001 are reflected in other line items of the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Income from Unconsolidated Cellular Entities, Minority Interest and Other Income and Expense. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased $42.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to outstanding indebtedness incurred to acquire the Verizon operations. Interest expense increased $32.7 million in 2000 primarily due to $41.5 million in interest expense related to the Verizon acquisition indebtedness and a $6.8 million increase caused by higher interest rates. Such increases were partially offset by interest expense reductions primarily due to a decrease in outstanding indebtedness exclusive of debt associated with the Verizon acquisitions. INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED CELLULAR ENTITIES Earnings from unconsolidated cellular entities, net of the amortization of associated goodwill, increased $474,000 (1.8%) in 2001 and decreased $689,000 (2.5%) in 2000. The $474,000 increase in 2001 was primarily due to (i) the Companys proportionate share ($5.3 million) of non cash charges recorded in the first quarter of 2000 by two cellular entities in which the Company owns a minority interest, (ii) a $2.2 million favorable adjustment related to the gain on the sale of PCS licenses to Leap by a cellular entity in which the Company owns a minority interest, and (iii) a $3.1 million increase due to increased earnings of certain cellular entities in which the Company owns a minority interest. Such increases were offset by a $10.1 million unfavorable non cash, nonrecurring charge that was recorded in 2001 by a cellular entity in which the Company owns a minority interest. The $689,000 decrease in 2000 was primarily due to (i) the Companys proportionate share ($5.3 million) of non cash, nonrecurring charges that were recorded in 2000 by cellular entities in which the Company owns a minority interest and (ii) a $2.3 million decrease due to decreased earnings of certain cellular entities in which the Company owns a minority interest. Such decreases were offset by a $6.9 million non cash charge recorded in 1999 by cellular entities in which the Company owns a minority interest. MINORITY INTEREST Minority interest is the expense recorded by the Company to reflect the minority interest owners share of the earnings of the Companys majority owned subsidiaries. Minority interest increased $1.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000 due primarily to increased profitability of certain of the Companys majority owned and operated entities. Minority interest decreased $17.7 million during 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to the minority partners share of the gain on sale of assets of the Brownsville and McAllen, Texas cellular properties recorded in 1999. Excluding the effect of this gain, minority interest decreased $2.8 million primarily due to the decreased profitability of the Companys majority owned and operated cellular entities ($1.3 million) and due to the minority partners share of the loss incurred by certain of the operations acquired from Verizon by CenturyTels majority owned affiliates ($1.6 million). OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE Other income and expense decreased $1.7 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to $6.0 million of costs incurred in 2001 associated with responding to an unsolicited takeover proposal and to other expense increases. These 2001 expense increases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to expenses in 2000, when the Company recorded a $7.9 million charge related to the settlement of certain interest rate hedge contracts entered into in connection with financing the Verizon acquisitions. Other income and expense decreased $2.5 million in 2000 compared to 1999 primarily due to the $7.9 million charge related to the settlement of certain interest rate hedge contracts entered into in connection with financing the Verizon acquisitions. Such decrease was partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in interest income. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Companys effective income tax rate was 38.0%, 40.1% and 44.1% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Exclusive of the effect of income tax expense on asset sales, the effective income tax rate was 39.0%, 39.9% and 39.0% in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. ACQUISITIONS On July 31, 2000 and September 29, 2000, affiliates of the Company acquired over 490,000 telephone access lines and related assets from Verizon in four separate transactions for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. Under these transactions: o On July 31, 2000, the Company purchased approximately 231,000 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 106 exchanges throughout Arkansas for approximately $842 million in cash. o On July 31, 2000, Spectra Communications Group, LLC ("Spectra") purchased approximately 127,000 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 107 exchanges throughout Missouri for approximately $297 million cash. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owns 75.7% of Spectra, which was organized to acquire and operate these Missouri properties. At closing, the Company made a preferred equity investment in Spectra of approximately $55 million (which represented a 57.1% interest) and financed substantially all of the remainder of the purchase price. In the first quarter of 2001, the Company purchased an additional 18.6% interest in Spectra for $47.1 million. o On September 29, 2000, the Company purchased approximately 70,500 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 42 exchanges throughout Wisconsin for approximately $197 million in cash. o On September 29, 2000, Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC ("TelUSA") purchased approximately 62,900 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 35 exchanges throughout Wisconsin for approximately $172 million in cash. The Company owns 89% of TelUSA, which was organized to acquire and own these Wisconsin properties. At closing, the Company made an equity investment in TelUSA of approximately $37.8 million and financed substantially all of the remainder of the purchase price. To finance these acquisitions on a short term basis, the Company borrowed $1.157 billion on a floating rate basis under its $1.5 billion credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. and Citibank, N.A. and borrowed $300 million on a floating rate basis under its 1997 credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. On October 19, 2000, the Company issued $500 million of 8.375% Senior Notes, Series H, due 2010, and $400 million of 7.75% Remarketable Senior Notes, Series I, due 2012 (with a remarketing date of October 15, 2002) under its $2.0 billion shelf registration statement filed in May 2000. The net proceeds of approximately $908 million (excluding the Companys payments of approximately $12.3 million associated with related interest rate hedging) were used to repay a portion of the $1.457 billion of aggregate indebtedness the Company incurred under its credit facilities in connection with the Verizon acquisitions. In October 2001, the Company entered into definitive agreements to purchase from affiliates of Verizon assets comprising all of Verizons operations in Missouri and Alabama for $2.159 billion cash. For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue recognition. Certain of the Companys telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate revenue. Under such sharing arrangements, which are typically administered by quasi governmental agencies, participating telephone companies contribute toll revenue or access charges within state jurisdictions and access charges in the interstate market. These revenues are pooled by the administrative agencies and used to reimburse exchange carriers for their costs. Typically, participating companies have 24 months to update or correct data previously submitted. As a result, revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on the Companys estimates. Historically, revisions of previous revenue estimates as a percentage of consolidated revenues have not been material. Accounting for the Effects of Regulation. The Companys regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of SFAS 71. Property, plant and equipment of the Companys regulated telephone operations has been depreciated using the straight line method over lives approved by regulators; such lives have generally exceeded the depreciable lives used by nonregulated entities. In addition, in accordance with SFAS 71, retirements of regulated telephone property have been charged to accumulated depreciation, along with the costs of removal, less salvage, with no gain or loss recognized. These policies have resulted in accumulated depreciation being significantly less than if the Companys telephone operations had not been regulated. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71" ("SFAS 101"), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by non regulated enterprises, along with an adjustment of certain accumulated depreciation accounts to reflect the difference between recorded depreciation and the amount of depreciation that would have been recorded had the Companys telephone operations not been subject to rate regulation. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for non regulated enterprises. Deferred tax liabilities and deferred investment tax credits will be impacted based on the change in the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation. The Company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to its regulated telephone operations by, among other things, assessing the extent of its interstate and intrastate operations that are subject to various forms of alternative regulation instead of traditional rate of return regulation. It is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the Companys telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. When the regulated operations of the Company no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, the net adjustments required may result in a material, noncash charge against earnings which would be reported as an extraordinary item. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of the Companys telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. The properties to be acquired from Verizon in 2002 are not expected to be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 71. Long lived assets. Through December 31, 2001, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long lived Assets and for Long lived Assets to be Disposed of," ("SFAS 121") the carrying value of long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and allocated goodwill, was reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that such carrying value was not recoverable, by assessing the recoverability of such carrying value through estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or the acquired business. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company will be required to test for impairment under two new accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill will be tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit will be based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. The Company is in the process of determining the impact, if any, of the transitional goodwill impairment rules of SFAS 142. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. For additional information on the Companys critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters, and the footnotes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that entities recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet. The Company had no derivative instruments outstanding at January 1, 2001 and thus no transition adjustment was recorded upon adoption of SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding an interest rate swap relating to $199.1 million of floating rate debt designed to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the payment of interest related to such debt. Under SFAS 133, the Company does not expect fluctuations in the fair value of the swap to be recorded in its statements of income. In addition, the Company has from time to time entered into interest rate hedge contracts in anticipation of certain debt issuances to manage interest rate exposure. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and SFAS 142. SFAS 141 requires all business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting; the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted. SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in a business combination to be reviewed for impairment and would be written down only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Effective January 1, 2002, systematic amortization of goodwill is no longer required. The Companys amortization of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $69.2 million. The application of the transitional goodwill impairment rules of SFAS 142 is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the Company. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 144, which replaces SFAS 121, and supersedes the accounting and reporting provisions related to discontinued operations under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30. SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. The provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of SFAS 144 is not expected to have a material effect on the results of operations of the Company. INFLATION The effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the Companys ability to recover certain costs applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. While the rate making process does not permit the Company to immediately recover the costs of replacing its physical plant, the Company has historically been able to recapture these costs over time. Possible future regulatory changes may alter the Companys ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations. For additional information regarding the current regulatory environment, see Regulation and Competition. As operating expenses in the Companys non regulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, the Company, to the extent permitted by competition, recovers the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment. MARKET RISK Approximately 90% of the Companys long term debt obligations are fixed rate. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated to be $3.0 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the Companys long term debt of 6.7% and an overall weighted maturity of 10 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. For purposes hereof, market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 67 basis points in interest rates (which represents ten percent of the Companys overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $96.4 million decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owed $353.0 million of debt on a floating rate basis. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding an interest rate swap relating to $191.1 million of its floating rate debt designed to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the payment of interest related to such debt. Under this swap, which expires in August 2002, the Company realizes a fixed effective rate of 4.845% and receives or makes settlement payments based upon the 3 month London InterBank Offered Rate, with settlement and rate reset dates at three month intervals through the expiration date. OTHER The Company is in the process of developing an integrated billing and customer care system. The costs to develop such system have been capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," and aggregated $139.5 million at December 31, 2001. Such costs are expected to aggregate approximately $200 million upon completion (which is expected to occur in early 2003) and are expected to be amortized over a twenty year period. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, the Company relies on cash provided by operations to provide for its cash needs. The Companys operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped the Company continue its long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $665.4 million, $562.5 million and $408.7 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Companys accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional information relating to the telephone operations, wireless operations and other operations of the Company, see Results of Operations. Investing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(275.7) million, $(1.914) billion and $69.8 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions was $47.1 million in 2001, $1.541 billion in 2000 (substantially all of which relates to the Verizon acquisitions) and $21.0 million in 1999. Proceeds from the sales of assets were $166.2 million in 2001 compared to $29.5 million in 2000 and $484.5 million in 1999. Capital expenditures for 2001 were $351.0 million for telephone operations, $71.2 million for wireless operations and $84.5 million for other operations. Capital expenditures during 2000 and 1999 were $449.5 million and $390.0 million, respectively. In connection with the sale of PCS licenses to Leap in 2001, the Company received an $86.5 million promissory note, all of which was subsequently collected during 2001. Financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(395.4) million in 2001, $1.314 billion in 2000 and $(427.6) million in 1999. Net payments of debt in 2001 were $375.6 million, which reflects utilization of cash received from asset sales. Net proceeds from the issuance of debt was $1.340 billion during 2000 primarily due to an increase in borrowings due to the purchase of assets from Verizon. Net payments of debt were $422.9 million in 1999. On July 31, 2000 and September 29, 2000, affiliates of the Company acquired over 490,000 telephone access lines and related assets from Verizon in four separate transactions for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. See Acquisitions and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. To finance these acquisitions on a short term basis, the Company borrowed $1.157 billion on a floating rate basis under its $1.5 billion credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. and Citibank, N.A., and borrowed $300 million on a floating rate basis under its 1997 credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. On October 19, 2000, the Company issued $500 million of 8.375% Senior Notes, Series H, due 2010, and $400 million of 7.75% Remarketable Senior Notes, Series I, due 2012 (with a remarketing date of October 15, 2002) under its $2.0 billion shelf registration statement filed in May 2000. The net proceeds of approximately $908 million (excluding the Companys payments of approximately $12.3 million associated with related interest rate hedging) were used to repay a portion of the $1.457 billion of aggregate indebtedness the Company incurred under its credit facilities in connection with the Verizon acquisitions. In second quarter 2001, the Company completed the sale of 30 PCS (Personal Communications Service) operating licenses for an aggregate of $195 million to Leap. The Company received approximately $108 million of the purchase price in cash at closing and the remainder was collected in installments through the fourth quarter of 2001 under the terms of a promissory note. In third quarter 2001, the Company sold its remaining shares of its investment in Illuminet common stock for an aggregate of approximately $58.2 million. Proceeds from these sales were used to repay indebtedness. On October 22, 2001, the Company entered into definitive agreements to purchase from affiliates of Verizon assets comprising all of Verizons local telephone operations in Missouri and Alabama. In exchange, the Company has agreed to pay approximately $2.159 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments which are not expected to be material. Under each definitive agreement, the Company has agreed to pay Verizon 10% of the transaction consideration if the purchase is not consummated under certain specified conditions, including the Companys incapacity to finance the transaction. The acquisitions are subject to the receipt of various state and federal regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The Companys financing plans are not yet complete and will be dependent upon the Companys review of its alternatives and market conditions. The properties to be acquired are currently subject to price cap regulation for interstate purposes, and the Company has no plans to change this. Because most of the Companys other telephone properties are subject to rate of return regulation, the Companys plans to retain price cap regulation for the acquired properties will require it to seek a waiver of the FCCs "all or nothing" regulation that generally requires a rate of return company acquiring a price cap company to convert all of its operations to price cap regulation. Although the FCC has granted similar waivers to other carriers over the past couple of years, no assurances can be provided that the FCC will grant a waiver to the Company. The Companys failure to obtain this waiver would adversely impact the financial benefits that the Company anticipates receiving in connection with its purchases of the Verizon properties. For additional information on these pending Verizon acquisitions, see Item 1 of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2001. Other. Budgeted capital expenditures for 2002 total $315 million for telephone operations, $65 million for wireless operations and $45 million for other operations. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in its telephone operations will continue to include the installation of fiber optic cable and the upgrading of its plant and equipment, including its digital switches, to provide enhanced services, particularly in its newly acquired markets. Capital expenditures in the wireless operations are expected to continue to focus on constructing additional cell sites (which will provide additional capacity and expanded areas where cellular phones may be used) and providing digital service. The Company continually evaluates the possibility of acquiring additional telecommunications operations and expects to continue its long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractive communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. The Company generally does not announce its acquisitions until it has entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. Over the past few years, the amount and size of communications properties available to be purchased by the Company has increased substantially. The Company may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.6 million shares of CenturyTel common stock and 200,000 shares of CenturyTel preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under CenturyTels acquisition shelf registration statement. The following table contains certain information concerning the Companys material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2001. Payments due by period Total contractual Less than After obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities $3,043,334 955,834 141,546 360,399 1,585,555 Verizon purchase price obligation $2,159,000 2,159,000 As of December 31, 2001, the Company has an aggregate of $499.1 million of debt outstanding under a credit facility and a note that expires or becomes due in August 2002 and has an additional $400 million in bonds that must be mandatorily redeemed by the Company in October 2002 if the remarketing dealer for these bonds does not purchase and remarket the bonds in accordance with a remarketing agreement. The Company intends to refinance such debt on a long term basis. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had available $470.1 million of undrawn committed bank lines of credit and the Companys telephone subsidiaries had available for use $123.0 million of commitments for long term financing from the Rural Utilities Service and Rural Telephone Bank. In addition, in October 2000 the Company implemented a commercial paper program that authorizes the Company to have outstanding up to $1.5 billion in commercial paper at any one time. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding $23.0 million under such program. The Company also has access to debt and equity capital markets, including its shelf registration statements. Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys") rates CenturyTels long term debt rating Baa2 (with a stable outlook) and Standard & Poors ("S&P") rates CenturyTels long term debt BBB+ (with a negative outlook). The Companys commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P.

These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. The 1996 Act provides certain exemptions for rural LECs such as those operated by the Company. Under the FCCs August 1996 order implementing most of the 1996 Acts interconnection provisions, rural LECs have the burden of proving the availability of these exemptions. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. Wireless services entities are also expected to increasingly compete with LECs. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies. The FCC adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period, effective July 1, 2001, based on embedded, or historical, costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers, including substantially all of the Companys local exchange carriers. The Company estimates (based on current operations, the current nationwide average cost per loop and other factors) that such ruling will increase the Companys level of universal service support receipts by approximately $7 million on an annualized basis compared to previous levels. During 2001 the Companys revenues from the federal universal service fund totaled approximately $168.7 million (which includes $21.6 million from the Verizon properties acquired in 2000). During 2000, such revenues totaled $146.4 million (which includes $8.3 million from the Verizon properties.) On October 11, 2001, the FCC modified its interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return local exchange carriers, which includes all of the Companys local exchange carriers. This order, among other things, (i) increases the caps on the subscriber line charges ("SLC") to the levels paid by most subscribers nationwide; (ii) allows limited SLC deaveraging, which is expected to enhance the competitiveness of rate of return carriers by giving them pricing flexibility; (iii) lowers per minute rates collected for federal access charges, which might increase competition with CenturyTels long distance operations to the extent other carriers seek to take advantage of this change; (iv) creates a new explicit universal service support mechanism that will replace other implicit support mechanisms in a manner designed to ensure that rate structure changes do not affect the overall recovery of interstate access costs by rate of return carriers serving high cost areas and (v) terminates the FCCs proceeding on the represcription of the authorized rate of return for rate of return LECs, which will remain at 11.25%. The Company expects the order to be implemented on a revenue neutral basis for interstate purposes, although there can be no assurance to this effect. Other proposals submitted to the FCC by the Multi Association Group representing rural carriers were rejected or deferred for additional comment. Recent events affecting the Company. During the last few years, several states in which the Company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the Companys service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the newly acquired Verizon markets, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. State alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the Companys LECs have also affected revenue growth recently. Although the Company believes that these plans may be favorable in the future as additional revenue streams are added and cost efficiencies are obtained, there can be no assurance that current or future alternative regulation plans will not reduce future revenue growth. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that the Company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its LECs. There is no assurance that these requests will not result in reduced intrastate access revenues in the future. In addition, the Company continues to receive pressure from other cellular operators to reduce roaming rates in the Companys cellular markets. In response, the Company anticipates that it will continue to enter into agreements that will reduce its roaming rates from current levels. The Company further anticipates that the adverse impact of reduced roaming rates may be partially offset by increased roaming traffic. In August 2001, the Company was awarded an interim access rate increase by the WPSC for the former Verizon properties in Wisconsin in an amount of approximately $7.9 million annually. Such rates are subject to refund pending an order establishing permanent rates. On October 31, 2001, the WPSC approved a permanent rate increase of $8.3 million annually for the local exchange properties that the Company acquired from Ameritech in December 1998. The WPSC ordered the Company to refund a portion ($1.5 million) of the previously approved interim rates. Such refund had the effect of a one time reduction in revenue of approximately $300,000 as the Company was not recognizing 100% of the interim rates as revenue. Separately, the WPSC ordered the Company to refund $14.7 million related to access charges collected from interexchange carriers on the former Ameritech properties from December 1998 through 2000. Such ruling was upheld upon appeal in Wisconsin State Court. The Company is currently appealing this ruling to the State of Wisconsin Court of Appeals. If this appeal is unsuccessful, the Company will have to record a one time charge of $.03 per share. In August 2001, the Arkansas Public Utility Commission ("APUC") approved tariff amendments that limit the number of minutes included for a flat rate in certain optional calling plans in certain of the acquired Verizon markets. Once fully implemented in January 2002, the Company anticipates that these tariff revisions will reduce the level of its operating expenses by approximately $20 million annually. On March 13, 2002, the Arkansas Court of Appeals vacated two orders issued by the APUC in connection with the Companys acquisition of its Arkansas LECs from Verizon in July 2000, and remanded the case back to the APUC for further hearings. The Court took these actions in response to challenges to the rates the Company has charged other LECs for intrastate switched access service. The Company intends to move for a rehearing of the Courts decision, and is currently evaluating the legal and financial implications of the Courts decision. Competition to provide traditional telephone services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural, suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the Companys telephone operations are located. Although the Company does not believe that the increased competition it has thus far experienced is likely to materially affect it in the near term, the Company anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive pressures may result in future revenue reductions. While the Company expects its telephone revenues to continue to grow, its internal telephone revenue growth rate has started to slow in recent years and may continue to slow during upcoming periods. The Companys wireless operations are subject to increased competition from large wireless carriers offering nationwide calling plans. The Company does not offer a nationwide calling plan at this time and may be hindered in its ability to compete for customers seeking these plans. Additionally, several wireless carriers have taken initial steps to abandon the TDMA standard used by the Company and to provide enhanced "next generation" wireless services utilizing different technologies. If the Company elects to continue to use the TDMA standard or to forego implementation of enhanced wireless services, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to receive support from vendors or to compete effectively against competitors using different technologies or offering more services. For these and other reasons, in August 2001, the Company announced that it is exploring the potential separation of its wireless business from its other operations. Other matters. The Companys regulated telephone operations are subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, under which the Company is required to account for the economic effects of the rate making process, including the recognition of depreciation of plant and equipment over lives approved by regulators. The ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to the Companys regulated telephone operations is being monitored due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments. When the regulated operations of the Company no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, the net adjustments required may result in a material, extraordinary, noncash charge against earnings. The properties to be acquired from Verizon in 2002 are not expected to be accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 71. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The Company has certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2001 have not been material, and the Company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Approximately 90% of the Companys long term debt obligations are fixed rate. At December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated to be $3.0 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the Companys long term debt of 6.7% and an overall weighted maturity of 10 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. For purposes hereof, market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 67 basis points in interest rates (which represents ten percent of the Companys overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $96.4 million decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owed $353.0 million of debt on a floating rate basis. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding an interest rate swap relating to $191.1 million of its floating rate debt designed to eliminate the variability of cash flows in the payment of interest related to such debt. Under this swap, which expires in August 2002, the Company realizes a fixed effective rate of 4.845% and receives or makes settlement payments based upon the three month London InterBank Offered Rate, with settlement and rate reset dates at three month intervals through the expiration date.
