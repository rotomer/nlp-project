Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations OVERVIEW CenturyTel, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") is a regional integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange, long distance, Internet access and data services to customers in 22 states. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired the local exchange telephone operations of Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") in the state of Alabama for approximately $1.022 billion cash. On August 31, 2002, the Company acquired the local exchange telephone operations of Verizon in the state of Missouri for approximately $1.179 billion cash. The results of operations for the Verizon assets acquired are reflected in the Companys consolidated results of operations subsequent to each respective acquisition. See "Acquisitions" below and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to an affiliate of ALLTEL Corporation ("Alltel") and certain other purchasers in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion in cash. As a result, the Companys wireless operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 have been reflected as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For further information, see "Discontinued Operations" below. On July 31, 2000 and September 29, 2000, affiliates of the Company acquired over 490,000 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets in Arkansas, Missouri and Wisconsin from affiliates of Verizon for an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion cash. The operations of these acquired properties are included in the Companys results of operations beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. See "Acquisitions" below and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During the three years ended December 31, 2002, the Company has acquired and sold various other operations, the impact of which has not been material to the financial position or results of operations of the Company. The net income of the Company for 2002 was $801.6 million, compared to $343.0 million during 2001 and $231.5 million during 2000. Diluted earnings per share for 2002 was $5.61 compared to $2.41 in 2001 and $1.63 in 2000. Income from continuing operations (and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) was $189.9 million ($1.33), $144.1 million ($1.01) and $124.2 million ($.88) for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), amortization of goodwill ceased effective January 1, 2002. Had the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 been subject to the provisions of SFAS 142, income from continuing operations (and diluted earnings per share) would have been $190.5 million ($1.34) for 2001 and $160.8 million ($1.13) for 2000 and net income (and diluted earnings per share) would have been $399.3 million ($2.81) for 2001 and $278.0 million ($1.96) for 2000. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income Telephone $ 543,113 423,420 376,290 Other 43,568 22,098 31,258 Corporate overhead costs allocable to discontinued operations (11,275) (20,213) (21,411) 575,406 425,305 386,137 Nonrecurring gains and losses, net 3,709 33,043 Interest expense (221,845) (225,523) (183,302) Other income and expense (63,814) 32 4,936 Income tax expense (103,537) (88,711) (83,542) Income from continuing operations 189,919 144,146 124,229 Discontinued operations, net of tax 611,705 198,885 107,245 Net income $ 801,624 343,031 231,474 Net income, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 801,624 399,297 278,029 Basic earnings per share From continuing operations $ 1.34 1.02 .88 From continuing operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 1.34 1.35 1.15 From discontinued operations $ 4.32 1.41 .77 From discontinued operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 4.32 1.48 .84 Basic earnings per share $ 5.66 2.43 1.65 Basic earnings per share, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 5.66 2.83 1.98 Diluted earnings per share From continuing operations $ 1.33 1.01 .88 From continuing operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 1.33 1.34 1.13 From discontinued operations $ 4.28 1.40 .76 From discontinued operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 4.28 1.47 .83 Diluted earnings per share $ 5.61 2.41 1.63 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 5.61 2.81 1.96 Average basic shares outstanding 141,613 140,743 140,069 Average diluted shares outstanding 142,879 142,307 141,864 During the three years ended December 31, 2002, the Company has recorded certain nonrecurring items. Net income (and diluted earnings per share) excluding nonrecurring items for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $325.0 million ($2.27), $225.7 million ($1.59; $1.98, as adjusted), and $228.8 million ($1.61; $1.94, as adjusted), respectively. The Company believes this presentation of results of operations excluding nonrecurring items is useful to investors because it (i) reflects managements view of recurring operations upon which management bases financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (ii) prevents investors from misconstruing the significance of financial data impacted by nonrecurring events. The following reconciliation table shows how the amounts of various line items reported under generally accepted accounting principles were impacted by these nonrecurring items.

Contributions to operating revenues and operating income by the Companys telephone and other operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2002 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Operating revenues Telephone operations 87.9 % 89.7 89.4 Other operations 12.1 % 10.3 10.6 Operating income Telephone operations 94.4 % 99.6 97.4 Other operations 7.6 % 5.2 8.1 Corporate overhead costs allocable to discontinued operations (2.0)% (4.8) (5.5) In addition to historical information, managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results and financial position. Such forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from such statements. Such uncertainties include but are not limited to: the Companys ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly acquired businesses into the Companys operations, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the effects of greater than anticipated competition in the Companys markets; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Companys products and services; the Companys ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; the Companys ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in general market or economic conditions or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the business are described in greater detail in Item 1 included herein. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward looking statements for any reason. TELEPHONE OPERATIONS The Company conducts its telephone operations in rural, suburban and small urban communities in 22 states. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 91% of the Companys 2.4 million access lines were in Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, Washington, Michigan, Louisiana, Colorado, Ohio and Oregon. The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys telephone operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Local service $ 604,580 491,529 408,538 Network access 972,303 874,458 727,797 Other 156,709 139,746 117,634 1,733,592 1,505,733 1,253,969 Operating expenses Plant operations 433,187 380,466 290,062 Customer operations 148,502 117,080 105,950 Corporate and other 211,924 186,483 163,761 Depreciation and amortization 396,866 398,284 317,906 1,190,479 1,082,313 877,679 Operating income $ 543,113 423,420 376,290 Local service revenues. Local service revenues are derived from the monthly provision of local exchange telephone services in the Companys service areas. Of the $113.1 million (23.0%) increase in local service revenues in 2002, $102.8 million was due to the acquisition of the Verizon properties in 2002. The remaining $10.3 million increase was primarily due to a $7.6 million increase resulting from the provision of custom calling features to more customers and a $1.8 million increase due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions. Of the $83.0 million (20.3%) increase in local service revenues in 2001, $73.7 million was due to the acquisition of the Verizon properties in 2000. The remaining $9.3 million increase was due to a $6.9 million increase due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions and an increase in the number of customer access lines in incumbent markets during most of 2001 and a $3.9 million increase due to the increased provision of custom calling features. Internal access lines declined 1.1% and 0.2% during 2002 and 2001, respectively. Internal access line growth during 2000 was 2.8%. The Company believes the decline in the number of access lines during 2002 and 2001 is primarily due to declines in second lines, soft general economic conditions in the Companys markets and the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive service providers. Even when the economy recovers, the Company believes that any rebound in access lines will be limited by continued declines in second lines caused primarily by digital subscriber line substitution and the impact of competitive services. Based on current conditions, the Company expects to incur a decline in access lines of 1 to 2% for 2003. Network access revenues. Network access revenues are primarily derived from charges to long distance companies and other customers for access to the Companys local exchange carrier ("LEC") networks in connection with the completion of interstate or intrastate long distance telephone calls. Certain of the Companys interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues increased $97.8 million (11.2%) in 2002 and $146.7 million (20.2%) in 2001 due to the following factors: 2002 2001 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Acquisitions of Verizon properties in third quarter 2002 $ 98,014 Acquisitions of Verizon properties in third quarter 2000 139,866 Increased recovery from the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") 13,832 8,507 One time refund of access charges to interexchange carriers (7,645) Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use and decreased access rates in certain states (27,740) (3,048) Partial recovery of increased operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, increased recovery from state support funds and return on rate base 9,756 16,252 Rate changes in certain jurisdictions 5,600 (916) Revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements 1,912 (16,876) Other, net 4,116 2,876 $ 97,845 146,661 In 2002 the Company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues (exclusive of the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) of approximately $27.7 million compared to 2001 primarily due to (i) a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and instant messaging services) and (ii) decreased access rates in certain states. The Company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2003. Although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated, the Company believes such decrease will be less than that incurred in 2002. Other revenues. Other revenues include revenues related to (i) leasing, selling, installing, maintaining and repairing customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring ("CPE services"), (ii) providing billing and collection services for long distance carriers and (iii) participating in the publication of local directories. Other revenues increased $17.0 million (12.1%) in 2002, of which $18.2 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002. Other revenues increased $22.1 million in 2001, primarily due to a $20.5 million increase attributable to revenues contributed by the properties acquired from Verizon in 2000. The remainder of the increase in 2001 was due primarily to a $7.0 million increase in revenues from CPE services (primarily due to an increase in rates) which was partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in billing and collection revenues. Operating expenses. Plant operations expenses during 2002 and 2001 increased $52.7 million (13.9%) and $90.4 million (31.2%), respectively. Of the $52.7 million increase in 2002, $58.4 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002 and $13.8 million related to increases in salaries and benefits. Such increases were partially offset by a $16.4 million decrease in access expenses primarily as a result of changes in certain optional calling plans in Arkansas approved in late 2001 and a $3.0 million decrease in repairs and maintenance expense. Of the $90.4 million increase in 2001, $87.3 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2000. The remaining $3.1 million increase was primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $2.7 million increase in network operations expenses and a $2.6 million increase in digital subscriber line ("DSL") expenses. Such increases were substantially offset by a $9.9 million decrease in engineering expenses. Customer operations, corporate and other expenses increased $56.9 million (18.7%) in 2002 and $33.9 million (12.6%) in 2001. Of the $56.9 million increase in 2002, $47.2 million related to the Verizon acquisitions in 2002. The remaining increase of $9.7 million was due primarily to a $7.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $4.6 million increase in customer service expenses and a $3.9 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts. Such increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in operating taxes and a $1.4 million decrease in expenses related to the provision of CPE services. The Company recorded a provision for uncollectible receivables for telecommunications carriers, primarily related to the bankruptcy of WorldCom, Inc., in the amount of $15.0 million during 2002. Such increase was partially offset by an $11.1 million reduction in the provision for uncollectible receivables for non carrier customers. Of the $33.9 million increase in customer operations, corporate and other expenses in 2001, $42.5 million related to the Verizon properties acquired in 2000. The remaining $8.6 million decrease in 2001 was primarily due to a $4.3 million decrease in the provision for uncollectible receivables and a $3.1 million decrease in operating taxes. Depreciation and amortization decreased $1.4 million (0.4%) in 2002 and increased $80.4 million (25.3%) in 2001. Of the $1.4 million decrease in 2002, $58.0 million related to ceasing amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. Such decrease was substantially offset by $38.0 million of depreciation and amortization related to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002 and a $21.8 million increase in depreciation expense due to higher levels of plant in service in incumbent markets. Of the $80.4 million increase in 2001, $65.2 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2000 (which included $14.7 million of amortization of goodwill) and the remainder was primarily due to higher levels of plant in service in incumbent markets. The composite depreciation rate for the Companys regulated telephone properties was 6.9% for 2002, 6.8% for 2001 and 7.2% for 2000. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact the Companys telephone operations, see "Regulation and Competition". OTHER OPERATIONS Other operations includes the results of continuing operations of subsidiaries of the Company which are not included in the telephone segment including, but not limited to, the Companys nonregulated long distance operations, Internet operations, competitive local exchange carrier ("CLEC") operations, fiber network business and security monitoring operations. The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys other operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Long distance $ 146,536 117,363 104,435 Internet 58,665 39,057 23,491 Other 33,203 17,351 20,462 238,404 173,771 148,388 Operating expenses Cost of sales and operating expenses 180,076 142,919 112,219 Depreciation and amortization 14,760 8,754 4,911 194,836 151,673 117,130 Operating income $ 43,568 22,098 31,258 Long distance revenues increased $29.2 million (24.9%) and $12.9 million (12.4%) in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The $29.2 million increase in 2002 was primarily attributable to the growth in the number of customers and increased average minutes of use ($34.8 million), partially offset by a decrease in the average rate charged by the Company per minute of use ($5.8 million). The $12.9 million increase in 2001 was due primarily to the growth in the number of customers and increased minutes of use, primarily due to penetration of the markets acquired from Verizon in 2000. The number of long distance customers as of December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was approximately 648,790, 465,870, and 363,300, respectively. Internet revenues increased $19.6 million (50.2%) in 2002 due to growth in the number of customers, primarily due to the expansion of the Companys DSL product offering. Internet revenues increased $15.6 million (66.3%) in 2001 primarily due to a $12.6 million increase due to growth in the number of customers (including growth in the Companys DSL product offering) and a $1.8 million increase due to Internet operations acquired in mid 2000. Other revenues increased $15.9 million in 2002, of which $15.1 million was due to increased revenues in the Companys CLEC business, primarily due to an acquisition of certain CLEC operations in the first quarter of 2002. Other revenues decreased $3.1 million in 2001 primarily due to the winding down of the Companys third party call center operations during 2000. Cost of sales and operating expenses increased $37.2 million (26.0%) in 2002 primarily due to (i) a $23.9 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys long distance operations (of which $13.4 million was due to increased payments to other carriers due to higher minutes of use partially offset by a decrease in the rate per minute of use; $5.3 million related to increased sales and marketing costs; $2.2 million was due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts; and $2.3 million was due to an increase in billing and collection costs); (ii) an $11.8 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys CLEC operations primarily due to the expansion of the business and operations acquired in the first quarter of 2002; and (iii) a $12.3 million increase associated with expanding the Companys Internet operations. Such increases were partially offset by a $7.4 million reduction in expenses primarily due to the increased intercompany profit with regulated affiliates (the recognition of which in accordance with regulatory accounting principles acts to offset operating expenses). Cost of sales and operating expenses increased $30.7 million (27.4%) in 2001 primarily due to (i) a $23.5 million increase in expenses related to the provision of Internet access primarily due to the expansion of the Companys DSL product offering, (ii) an increase of $9.3 million in expenses of the Companys long distance operations primarily due to an increase in the number of customers and an increase in marketing expenses, and (iii) an $8.3 million increase due to the expansion of the Companys CLEC business. Such increases were partially offset by a $6.5 million reduction in expenses due to the winding down of the Companys third party call center operations during 2000. Depreciation and amortization increased $6.0 million in 2002 and $3.8 million in 2001 primarily due to increased depreciation expense in the Companys CLEC, Internet and fiber network businesses. The Company incurred combined operating losses in 2002 and 2001 of $16.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively, in its CLEC and fiber network businesses, and expects to incur a combined operating loss ranging from $13 to $18 million in 2003 related to these operations. Certain of the Companys service subsidiaries provide managerial, operational, technical, accounting and administrative services, along with materials and supplies, to the Companys telephone subsidiaries. In accordance with regulatory accounting, intercompany profit on transactions with regulated affiliates has not been eliminated in connection with consolidating the results of operations of the Company. When the regulated operations of the Company no longer qualify for the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"), such intercompany profit will be eliminated in subsequent financial statements, the primary result of which will be a decrease in operating expenses applicable to the Companys telephone operations and an increase in operating expenses applicable to the Companys other operations. The amount of intercompany profit with regulated affiliates which was not eliminated was approximately $29.5 million, $22.0 million and $17.1 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For additional information applicable to SFAS 71, see "Regulation and Competition Other Matters." NONRECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES, NET In 2002, the Company recorded a pre tax gain of $3.7 million from the sale of a PCS license. In 2001, the Companys net favorable nonrecurring pre tax gains were $33.0 million. The Company recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of its remaining shares of Illuminet Holdings, Inc. ("Illuminet") common stock aggregating $54.6 million ($35.5 million after tax; $.25 per diluted share) and a pre tax gain of $4.0 million ($2.6 million after tax; $.02 per diluted share) on the sale of certain other assets. Additionally in 2001, the Company recorded pre tax charges of $25.5 million ($16.6 million after tax; $.12 per diluted share) due to the write down in the value of certain non operating investments in which the Company owns a minority interest. Certain other nonrecurring items for the three year period ended December 31, 2002 are reflected in other line items of the Companys consolidated financial statements. See "Results of Operations Overview". INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $3.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001 due to a decrease in average debt outstanding and decreased rates. Interest expense increased $42.2 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to outstanding indebtedness incurred to acquire the Verizon operations. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE Other expense was $63.8 million in 2002 compared to other income of $32,000 in 2001. Such decrease was primarily due to a $59.9 million pre tax charge related to the Companys payment of premium in connection with redeeming its Series I remarketable notes, net of unamortized premium. Other income decreased $4.9 million in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to $6.0 million of costs incurred in 2001 associated with responding to an unsolicited takeover proposal; a $1.7 million increase in minority interest expense due primarily to increased profitability of certain of the Companys majority owned affiliates; and to other expense increases. These 2001 expense increases were partially offset by a favorable comparison to expenses in 2000, when the Company recorded a $7.9 million charge related to the settlement of certain interest rate hedge contracts entered into in connection with financing the 2000 Verizon acquisitions. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Companys effective income tax rate (from continuing operations) was 35.3%, 38.1% and 40.2% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to the effect of ceasing amortization of goodwill (some of which was nondeductible for tax purposes) effective January 1, 2002 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to Alltel and certain other purchasers for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion in cash. As a result, the Companys wireless operations for 2002 have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The results of operations for 2001 and 2000 have been restated to conform to the 2002 presentation. The following table summarizes certain information concerning the Companys wireless operations for the periods presented. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues $ 246,705 437,965 443,569 Operating expenses, exclusive of corporate overhead costs of $11.3 million, $20.2 million and $21.4 million (175,447) (305,351) (304,293) Income from unconsolidated cellular entities 31,350 27,460 26,986 Minority interest expense (8,569) (11,510) (11,598) Gain on sale of discontinued operations 803,905 Nonrecurring gains 166,928 20,593 Other income 188 4,707 3,157 Income tax expense (286,427) (121,314) (71,169) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 611,705 198,885 107,245 Included in operating expenses for 2002 is a $30.5 million charge associated with a write off of all amounts expended to develop the wireless portion of the Companys billing system currently in development. Depreciation and amortization of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles related to the Companys wireless operations ceased effective March 19, 2002, the date of the Companys definitive sales agreement with Alltel. Such cessation of depreciation and amortization had the effect of reducing depreciation and amortization expense approximately $20 million in 2002 and thereby contributing approximately $.08 to the Companys diluted earnings per share for 2002. The Company recorded an $803.9 million pre tax gain on the sale of substantially all of its wireless business in the third quarter of 2002. Nonrecurring gains for 2001 relate to the sale of 30 PCS licenses to Leap Wireless International, Inc. Nonrecurring gains for 2000 relate to the sale of the Companys remaining Alaska cellular operations and its minority interest in one other market. For further information, see Notes 3 and 13 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS Verizon 2002 Acquisitions. On July 1, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 300,000 telephone access lines in the state of Alabama from Verizon for approximately $1.022 billion cash. On August 31, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 350,000 telephone access lines in the state of Missouri from Verizon for approximately $1.179 billion cash. On May 6, 2002, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units. Net proceeds to the Company from this issuance were approximately $483.4 million. Each of the 20 million equity units issued was priced at $25 and consists initially of a beneficial interest in a CenturyTel senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel common stock no later than May 2005. The senior notes mature in May 2007. Each purchase contract will generally require the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel common stock in May 2005 based on the then current stock price of CenturyTel common stock in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. Accordingly, upon full settlement of the purchase contracts in May 2005, the Company will receive proceeds of $500 million and will deliver between 13.9 million and 17.5 million common shares in the aggregate. The senior notes are pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contracts. The total distributions on the equity units will be at an initial annual rate of 6.875%, consisting of interest (6.02%) and contract adjustment payments (0.855%), each payable quarterly. On or after mid February 2005, the senior notes will be remarketed, at which time the remarketing agent will reset the interest rate on the senior notes in order to generate sufficient proceeds to secure the holders obligation under the purchase contract. In the event of an unsuccessful remarketing, the Company will exercise its right as a secured party to dispose of the senior notes and satisfy in full the holders obligation to purchase common stock under the purchase contract. On July 22, 2002, the Company entered into $800 million of credit facilities, consisting of a $533 million three year facility and a $267 million 364 day revolving facility with a one year term out option. These facilities replaced credit facilities that matured during the third quarter of 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued $500 million of senior notes due 2012 (which bear interest at 7.875%) and $165 million of convertible senior debentures (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion price of $40.455 per share). The Company used proceeds from the sale of equity units, senior notes and convertible senior debentures, along with the $1.59 billion cash proceeds received from the sale of substantially all of the Companys wireless operations and utilization of its credit facilities, to finance the third quarter 2002 acquisitions of telephone properties in Alabama and Missouri from Verizon which aggregated $2.201 billion, the redemption of $400 million principal amount in remarketable debt securities (plus an associated $71.1 million premium payment) in October 2002, and the Companys fourth quarter 2002 estimated tax payment, which aggregated $290 million and included the obligation to pay taxes associated with the sale of substantially all of its wireless operations. Verizon 2000 Acquisitions. On July 31, 2000 and September 29, 2000, affiliates of the Company acquired over 490,000 telephone access lines and related assets from Verizon in four separate transactions for approximately $1.5 billion in cash. Under these transactions: o On July 31, 2000, the Company purchased approximately 231,000 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 106 exchanges throughout Arkansas for approximately $842 million in cash. o On July 31, 2000, Spectra Communications Group, LLC ("Spectra") purchased approximately 127,000 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 107 exchanges throughout Missouri for approximately $297 million cash. The Company currently owns 75.7% of Spectra, which was organized to acquire and operate these Missouri properties. At closing, the Company made a preferred equity investment in Spectra of approximately $55 million (which represented a 57.1% interest) and financed substantially all of the remainder of the purchase price. In the first quarter of 2001, the Company purchased an additional 18.6% interest in Spectra for $47.1 million. o On September 29, 2000, the Company purchased approximately 70,500 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 42 exchanges throughout Wisconsin for approximately $197 million in cash. o On September 29, 2000, Telephone USA of Wisconsin, LLC ("TelUSA") purchased approximately 62,900 telephone access lines and related local exchange assets comprising 35 exchanges throughout Wisconsin for approximately $172 million in cash. The Company owns 89% of TelUSA, which was organized to acquire and own these Wisconsin properties. At closing, the Company made an equity investment in TelUSA of approximately $37.8 million and financed substantially all of the remainder of the purchase price. To finance these acquisitions on a short term basis, the Company borrowed $1.157 billion on a floating rate basis under its $1.5 billion credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. and Citibank, N.A. and borrowed $300 million on a floating rate basis under its 1997 credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. On October 19, 2000, the Company issued $500 million of 8.375% Senior Notes, Series H, due 2010, and $400 million of 7.75% Remarketable Senior Notes, Series I, due 2012 (with a remarketing date of October 15, 2002). The net proceeds of approximately $908 million (excluding the Companys payments of approximately $12.3 million associated with related interest rate hedging) were used to repay a portion of the $1.457 billion of aggregate indebtedness the Company incurred under its credit facilities in connection with the Verizon acquisitions. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141") and SFAS 142. SFAS 141 requires all business combinations consummated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting; the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted. The Company adopted SFAS 141 on July 1, 2001. SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in a business combination to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and to be written down only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. Effective January 1, 2002, systematic amortization of goodwill is no longer permitted. The Company adopted SFAS 142 effective January 1, 2002. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 144 on January 1, 2002. The Companys wireless operations have been reflected as discontinued operations for 2002 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 144. Results of operations for 2001 and 2000 have been restated to conform to this presentation. The adoption of the impairment portion of SFAS 144 did not have a material effect on the results of operations of the Company. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143, effective beginning January 1, 2003, addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although the Company generally has had no legal obligation to remove assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the Companys telephone operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. SFAS 71 requires the Company to not remove this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. For the Companys telephone operations not subject to SFAS 71 (the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) and its other operations, the Company has not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs in the past and will continue to expense the costs of removal as incurred since there is no legal obligation to remove assets. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 143 to have a material effect on its financial statements. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as allowed by SFAS 123. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) purchase price allocation, (iv) pension and postretirement benefits and (v) long lived assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. Certain of the Companys telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate revenue. Under such sharing arrangements, which are typically administered by quasi governmental agencies, participating telephone companies contribute toll revenue or access charges within state jurisdictions and access charges in the interstate market. These revenues are pooled by the administrative agencies and used to reimburse exchange carriers for their costs. Typically, participating companies have 24 months to update or correct data previously submitted. As a result, revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on the Companys estimates. Historically, revisions of previous revenue estimates have not been material. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable, the Company assesses a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, the Company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount the Company ultimately expects to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the Companys past collection experience is no longer relevant, the Companys estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Purchase price allocation. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, the Company allocated the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets was determined by an independent appraisal of such assets. The fair value of the postretirement benefit obligation was determined through actuarial valuations. The fair value of current assets and current liabilities was assumed to approximate the recorded value at acquisition due to their short maturity. The remaining unallocated acquisition cost was considered goodwill. Pension and postretirement benefits. The amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption used in determining the Companys pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2002, such expected return was assumed to range between 8 10%, with 10% being used on the plans with the greatest amount of assets. For the past several years, our actual return on plan assets has been significantly lower than the 8 10% range. For 2003, the Company lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to range from 8 8.25%, reflecting the expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets. Another assumption used in the determination of the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate, which is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate bonds. The Company lowered its assumed discount rate to 6.75% at December 31, 2002 from 7.00% at December 31, 2001. Changes in the discount rate do not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. See "Pension and Medical Costs" for additional information. Long lived assets. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company was subject to test for impairment of long lived assets under two new accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), and SFAS 144. SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. The Company completed the initial transitional goodwill impairment test (as of January 1, 2002) as well as the required annual test (as of September 30, 2002) of SFAS 142 and has determined its goodwill is not impaired. Prior to January 1, 2002, substantially all of the Companys goodwill was amortized over 40 years. The Companys amortization of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 totaled approximately $69.2 million and $60.1 million, respectively. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. For additional information on the Companys critical accounting policies, see "Accounting Pronouncements" and "Regulation and Competition Other Matters", and the footnotes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. INFLATION The effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the Companys ability to recover certain costs applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. While the rate making process does not permit the Company to immediately recover the costs of replacing its physical plant, the Company has historically been able to recapture these costs over time. Possible future regulatory changes may alter the Companys ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes are limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. For additional information regarding the current regulatory environment, see "Regulation and Competition." As operating expenses in the Companys nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, the Company, to the extent permitted by competition, attempts to recover the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment. MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations. The Company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value on long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated to be $3.9 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the Companys long term debt of 6.0% and an overall weighted maturity of 11 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. With respect to the Companys fixed rate long term debt obligations, market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 60 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of the Companys overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $149.4 million decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt. As of December 31, 2002, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 86% of the Companys long term debt obligations were fixed rate. The Company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, the Company uses derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding a fair value interest rate hedge associated with $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series H senior notes, due 2010, that pays interest at a fixed rate of 8.375%. This hedge is a "fixed to variable" interest rate swap that effectively converts the Companys fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates equal to the six month London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 3.59% with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedge in October 2010. At December 31, 2002, the Company realized a rate under this hedge of 4.96%. Interest expense was reduced by $7.8 million in 2002 as a result of this hedge. The fair market value of this hedge was $22.2 million at December 31, 2002 and is reflected as an asset and as an adjustment to the underlying debt on the December 31, 2002 balance sheet. With respect to this hedge, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $14.5 million decrease in the fair value of this hedge. At December 31, 2002, the Company also had outstanding a cash flow hedge associated with $400 million of borrowings under its $800 million credit facilities. Such hedge expires in October 2003. This hedge is designed to swap the Companys future obligation to pay variable rate interest based on LIBOR into obligations that lock in a fixed rate of 2.49%. The fair value of this hedge was $1.3 million at December 31, 2002 and is reflected as a liability and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (net of tax) on the December 31, 2002 balance sheet. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $622,000 decrease in the fair value (liability) of this hedge. DEVELOPMENT OF BILLING SYSTEM The Company is in the process of developing an integrated billing and customer care system. The costs to develop such system have been capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," and aggregated $139.5 million at December 31, 2002. A portion of these billing system costs related to the wireless business ($30.5 million) was written off as a component of discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2002 as a result of the sale of substantially all of the Companys wireless operations on August 1, 2002. See Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Excluding this write off, the Companys aggregate billing system costs are expected to approximate $180 million upon completion and are expected to be amortized over a twenty year period. The Company expects to begin amortization of the billing system in 2003 as customer groups are migrated to this new system. In addition, the Company expects to incur duplicative system costs in 2003 until such time as all customers are migrated to the new system. Such amortization and duplicative system costs are expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by $.04 for 2003. The system remains in the development stage and has required substantially more time and money to develop than originally anticipated. Although the Company expects to complete all phases of the system in early 2004, there is no assurance that this deadline (or the Companys budget) will be met or that the system will function as anticipated. If the system does not function as anticipated, the Company may have to write off part or all of its remaining costs. PENSION AND MEDICAL COSTS The decline in equity markets in recent years, coupled with record low interest rates and rising medical costs, have increased the Companys employee benefits expenses, including defined benefit pension expenses and pre and post retirement medical expenses. The Company expects these conditions will result in higher pension and pre and post retirement medical expenses in 2003. Based on the Companys current estimates, such costs are expected to increase between $15 25 million in 2003 compared to 2002 amounts. As a result of continued increases in medical costs, the Company discontinued its practice of subsidizing post retirement medical benefits for persons hired after January 1, 2003. OTHER In connection with the acquisitions of telephone properties from Verizon in 2002, the Company had an independent appraisal performed to determine the fair value of the property, plant and equipment acquired from Verizon. Such appraisal was not completed until March 2003; therefore, the Companys December 31, 2002 balances of property, plant and equipment and goodwill, as presented in the Companys fourth quarter 2002 earnings news release contained in a Current Report on Form 8 K filed January 31, 2003, differ from those presented elsewhere herein. As a result of the appraisal, property, plant and equipment was increased by $202.6 million and goodwill was decreased by a like amount. Depreciation expense calculated based on the appraised values of property, plant and equipment is not materially different from that previously presented in the above described Form 8 K and therefore has not been changed. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, the Company relies on cash provided by operations to provide for its cash needs. The Companys operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped the Company continue its long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $795.4 million, $575.5 million and $438.2 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional information relating to the continuing and discontinued operations of the Company, see Results of Operations. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $2.629 billion, $420.9 million and $1.914 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions was $2.245 billion in 2002 (substantially all of which relates to the 2002 Verizon acquisitions), $47.1 million in 2001 and $1.536 billion in 2000 (substantially all of which relates to the 2000 Verizon acquisitions). Proceeds from the sales of assets were $4.1 million in 2002 (excluding the Companys 2002 wireless divestiture) and $58.2 million in 2001. Capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2002 were $319.5 million for telephone operations and $66.7 million for other operations. Capital expenditures from continuing operations during 2001 and 2000 were $435.5 million and $391.1 million, respectively. Financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations was $506.3 million in 2002, ($395.4) million in 2001 and $1.314 billion in 2000. Proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of debt payments, were $531.4 million during 2002, compared to net payments of debt of $375.6 million during 2001. Net proceeds from the issuance of debt was $1.340 billion during 2000 primarily due to an increase in borrowings due to the purchase of assets from Verizon. On May 6, 2002, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units. Net proceeds to the Company from this issuance were approximately $483.4 million. Each of the 20 million equity units issued was priced at $25 and consists initially of a beneficial interest in a CenturyTel senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel common stock no later than May 2005. The senior notes will mature in May 2007. Each stock purchase contract will generally require the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel common stock in May 2005 in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. The total distributions on the equity units will be at an initial annual rate of 6.875%, consisting of interest (6.02%) and contract adjustment payments (0.855%). For additional information, see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. On July 22, 2002, the Company entered into $800 million of credit facilities, consisting of a $533 million three year facility and a $267 million 364 day revolving facility with a one year term out option. These facilities replaced credit facilities that matured during the third quarter of 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued $500 million of senior notes due 2012 (which bear interest at 7.875%) and $165 million of convertible senior debentures (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion price of $40.455 per share). Holders of the convertible senior debentures will have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on August 1, 2006, August 1, 2010 and August 1, 2017 at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to Alltel and certain other purchasers for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion cash. The Company used proceeds from the sale of equity units, senior notes and convertible senior debentures, along with the proceeds received from the sale of the Companys wireless operations and utilization of its $800 million credit facilities, to finance the third quarter 2002 acquisitions of telephone properties in Alabama and Missouri from Verizon which aggregated $2.201 billion, the redemption of $400 million principal amount in remarketable debt securities (plus an associated $71.1 million premium payment) in October 2002 and the Companys fourth quarter 2002 estimated tax payment, which aggregated $290 million and included the obligation to pay taxes associated with the sale of substantially all of its wireless operations. In second quarter 2001, the Company completed the sale of 30 PCS operating licenses for an aggregate of $195 million to Leap. The Company received approximately $108 million of the purchase price in cash at closing and the remainder was collected in installments through the fourth quarter of 2001. Such proceeds, and the proceeds from the Companys above described divestiture of its wireless operations in 2002, are included as net cash provided by discontinued operations on the statements of cash flows appearing elsewhere in this report. In third quarter 2001, the Company sold its remaining shares of its investment in Illuminet common stock for an aggregate of approximately $58.2 million. Proceeds from these sales were used to repay indebtedness. Other. Budgeted capital expenditures for 2003 total $370 million for telephone operations and $30 million for other operations. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in its telephone operations will continue to include the upgrading of its plant and equipment, including its digital switches, to provide enhanced services, particularly in its newly acquired markets, and the installation of fiber optic cable. The Company continually evaluates the possibility of acquiring additional telecommunications operations and expects to continue its long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractive communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. The Company generally does not announce its acquisitions until it has entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. Over the past few years, the amount and size of communications properties available to be purchased by the Company has increased substantially. The Company may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operations.

These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. The 1996 Act provides certain exemptions for rural LECs such as those operated by the Company. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of the Companys telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. On February 20, 2003, the FCC revised its rules outlining the obligations of incumbent LECs to lease elements of their networks on an unbundled basis to competitors. The new framework eliminates the prior obligation of incumbent LECs to lease their high speed data lines to competitors. Incumbent LECs will remain obligated to offer other telecommunications services to resellers at wholesale rates. This new rule also provides for a significant role of state regulatory commissions in implementing these new guidelines and establishing wholesale service rates. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. Wireless services entities also increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LECs. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies. The FCC adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period, effective July 1, 2001, based on embedded, or historical, costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers, including substantially all of the Companys local exchange carriers. During 2002 the Companys interstate revenues from the federal universal service fund totaled approximately $192.4 million (which includes $9.9 million from the Verizon properties acquired in 2002). During 2001 and 2000, such revenues totaled $168.7 million and $146.4 million, respectively. Increasingly, wireless carriers have sought and received payments from the Universal Service Fund, which the Company believes is currently enhancing their ability to compete with wireline services and, in the long term, could adversely impact the amount of funding available for LECs. On October 11, 2001, the FCC modified its interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return local exchange carriers, which includes the Companys local exchange carriers (excluding the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002). This order, among other things, (i) increased the caps on the subscriber line charges ("SLC") to the levels paid by most subscribers nationwide; (ii) allowed limited SLC deaveraging, which is expected to enhance the competitiveness of rate of return carriers by giving them pricing flexibility; (iii) lowered per minute rates collected for federal access charges, which might increase competition with CenturyTels long distance operations to the extent other carriers seek to take advantage of this change; (iv) created a new explicit universal service support mechanism that will replace other implicit support mechanisms in a manner designed to ensure that rate structure changes do not affect the overall recovery of interstate access costs by rate of return carriers serving high cost areas and (v) terminated the FCCs proceeding on the represcription of the authorized rate of return for rate of return LECs, which will remain at 11.25%. The effect of this order on the Company was revenue neutral for interstate purposes; however, intrastate revenues were adversely effected in Arkansas and Ohio as the intrastate access rates in these states mirror the interstate access rates. Recent events affecting the Company. During the last few years, several states in which the Company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the Companys service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. State alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the Companys LECs have also affected revenue growth recently. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that the Company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its LECs. In addition, the Company has recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless services. In 2002 the Company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues (exclusive of the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) of approximately $27.7 million compared to 2001 primarily due to these factors. The Company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2003. Although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated, the Company believes such decrease will be less than that incurred in 2002. In August 2001, the Company was awarded an interim access rate increase by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission ("WPSC") for the former Verizon properties in Wisconsin in an amount of approximately $7.9 million annually. In October 2002, the Company was awarded a permanent rate increase which will result in an additional $8 to $10 million annually above the $7.9 million awarded on an interim basis. On August 29, 2002, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld a ruling upon appeal that ordered the Company to refund intrastate access charges collected from interexchange carriers from December 1998 through December 2000 on the Wisconsin properties acquired from Ameritech in December 1998. As a result of this ruling, the Company recorded a one time charge of $7.6 million ($.03 per share) related to this refund in the third quarter of 2002. On October 31, 2001, the WPSC approved a permanent rate increase of $8.3 million annually for these properties. This increase was partially offset by a one time reduction in revenue of approximately $300,000 arising out of the WPSCs order to refund a portion of the previously approved interim rates. In August 2001, the Arkansas Public Utility Commission ("APUC") approved tariff amendments that limited the number of minutes included for a flat rate in certain optional calling plans in certain of the markets acquired from Verizon in 2000. These revisions resulted in reductions of the Companys operating expenses of approximately $17.5 million during 2002 compared to 2001. On March 13, 2002, the Arkansas Court of Appeals vacated two orders issued by the Arkansas Public Service Commission ("APSC") in connection with the Companys acquisition of its Arkansas LECs from Verizon in July 2000, and remanded the case back to the APSC for further hearings. The Court took these actions in response to challenges to the rates the Company has charged other LECs for intrastate switched access service. On December 20, 2002, the APSC approved the access rates established by the Company at the time of acquisition. On January 29, 2003, AT&T filed with the APSC a petition for rehearing related to this ruling. In January 2003, the Louisiana Public Service Commission directed its staff to review the feasibility of converting the $42 million Louisiana Local Optional Service Fund ("LOS Fund") into a state universal service fund. A recommendation by the Commission staff is expected by the end of 2003. Currently, the LOS Fund is funded primarily by BellSouth, which proposes to expand the base of contributors into the LOS Fund. The Company currently receives approximately $21 million from the LOS Fund each year. There can be no assurance that this funding will remain at current levels. Competition to provide traditional telephone services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural, suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the Companys telephone operations are located. Although the Company does not believe that the increased competition it has thus far experienced is likely to materially affect it in the near term, the Company anticipates that regulatory changes and competitive pressures may result in future revenue reductions. The Company expects its internal telephone revenues (exclusive of the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) to decline in 2003 primarily due to continued access line loss and reduced intrastate revenues; however, the Company expects its internal consolidated revenues to increase in 2003 primarily due to expected increased demand for its long distance, DSL and other product offerings. Other matters. The Companys regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. The Company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to its regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the Companys telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71" ("SFAS 101"), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. The Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 included regulatory assets of approximately $3.2 million (primarily related to deferred financing costs, regulatory proceedings and income taxes) and regulatory liabilities of approximately $1.7 million (related to income taxes). Net deferred income tax liabilities related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $1.1 million. When the Companys regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, the Company does not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of its regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, the Company would be required to revise the lives of its property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company does not expect such revisions in asset lives to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of the Companys telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. The Company has certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2002 have not been material, and the Company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations. The Company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value on long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2002, the fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated to be $3.9 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the Companys long term debt of 6.0% and an overall weighted maturity of 11 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 60 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of the Companys overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $149.4 million decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt. As of December 31, 2002, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 86% of the Companys long term debt obligations were fixed rate. The Company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, the Company uses derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding a fair value interest rate hedge associated with $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series H senior notes, due 2010, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 8.375%. This hedge is a "fixed to variable" interest rate swap that effectively converts the Companys fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates equal to the six month London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 3.59% with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedge in October 2010. At December 31, 2002, the Company realized a rate under this hedge of 4.96%. Interest expense was reduced by $7.8 million in 2002 as a result of this hedge. The fair market value of this hedge was $22.2 million at December 31, 2002 and is reflected as an asset and as an adjustment to the underlying debt on the December 31, 2002 balance sheet. With respect to this hedge, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $14.5 million decrease in the fair value of this hedge. At December 31, 2002, the Company also had outstanding a cash flow hedge associated with $400 million of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 under its $800 million credit facilities. Such hedge expires in October 2003. This hedge is designed to swap the Companys future obligation to pay variable rate interest based on LIBOR into obligations that lock in a fixed rate of 2.49%. The fair value of this hedge was $1.3 million at December 31, 2002 and is reflected as a liability and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (net of tax) on the December 31, 2002 balance sheet. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $622,000 decrease in the fair value (liability) of this hedge.
