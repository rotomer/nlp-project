Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Overview CenturyTel, Inc. ("CenturyTel") and its subsidiaries is a regional integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange, long distance, Internet access and data services to customers in 22 states. For the year ended December 31, 2003, local exchange telephone operations provided 87% of the consolidated revenues of CenturyTel and its subsidiaries (the "Company"). The Companys local exchange telephone operations derive revenues from providing (i) local telephone services, (ii) network access services and (iii) other related services. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired the local exchange telephone operations of Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") in the state of Alabama for approximately $1.022 billion cash. On August 31, 2002, the Company acquired the local exchange telephone operations of Verizon in the state of Missouri for approximately $1.179 billion cash. The results of operations for the Verizon assets acquired are reflected in the Companys consolidated results of operations subsequent to each respective acquisition. See "Acquisitions" below and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2003, the Company also acquired fiber transport assets in five central U.S. states (which the Company operates under the name LightCore) for $55.2 million cash. On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations principally to an affiliate of ALLTEL Corporation ("Alltel") in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion in cash. As a result, the Companys wireless operations for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 have been reflected as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For further information, see "Discontinued Operations" below. During the three years ended December 31, 2003, the Company has acquired and sold various other operations, the impact of which has not been material to the financial position or results of operations of the Company. The net income of the Company for 2003 was $344.7 million, compared to $801.6 million during 2002 and $343.0 million during 2001. Diluted earnings per share for 2003 was $2.38 compared to $5.61 in 2002 and $2.41 in 2001. Income from continuing operations (and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) was $344.7 million ($2.38), $193.5 million ($1.35) and $149.1 million ($1.05) for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), amortization of goodwill ceased effective January 1, 2002. If the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 been subject to the provisions of SFAS 142, income from continuing operations (and diluted earnings per share) would have been $195.4 million ($1.37) and net income (and diluted earnings per share) would have been $399.3 million ($2.81). Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income Telephone $ 688,114 543,113 423,420 Other 62,282 43,568 22,098 Corporate overhead costs allocable to discontinued operations (11,275) (20,213) 750,396 575,406 425,305 Interest expense (226,751) (221,845) (225,523) Income from unconsolidated cellular entity 6,160 5,582 7,592 Nonrecurring gains and losses, net 3,709 33,043 Other income and expense 2,154 (63,814) 32 Income tax expense (187,252) (105,505) (91,368) Income from continuing operations 344,707 193,533 149,081 Discontinued operations, net of tax 608,091 193,950 Net income $ 344,707 801,624 343,031 Net income, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 344,707 801,624 399,297 Basic earnings per share From continuing operations $ 2.40 1.36 1.06 From continuing operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 2.40 1.36 1.39 From discontinued operations $ 4.29 1.38 From discontinued operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 4.29 1.45 Basic earnings per share $ 2.40 5.66 2.43 Basic earnings per share, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 2.40 5.66 2.83 Diluted earnings per share From continuing operations $ 2.38 1.35 1.05 From continuing operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 2.38 1.35 1.37 From discontinued operations $ 4.26 1.36 From discontinued operations, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 4.26 1.43 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.38 5.61 2.41 Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted for goodwill amortization $ 2.38 5.61 2.81 Average basic shares outstanding 143,583 141,613 140,743 Average diluted shares outstanding 144,700 142,879 142,307 Contributions to operating revenues and operating income by the Companys telephone and other operations for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2003 were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Operating revenues Telephone operations 87.0% 87.9 89.7 Other operations 13.0% 12.1 10.3 Operating income Telephone operations 91.7% 94.4 99.6 Other operations 8.3% 7.6 5.2 Corporate overhead costs allocable to discontinued operations % (2.0) (4.8) In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Companys ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly acquired businesses into the Companys operations, hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff, and successfully upgrading its billing and other information systems; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Companys products and services; the Companys ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; the Companys ability to collect its receivables from financially troubled communications companies; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the business are described in greater detail in Item 1 included herein. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward looking statements for any reason. Telephone Operations The Company conducts its telephone operations in rural, suburban and small urban communities in 22 states. As of December 31, 2003, approximately 70% of the Companys 2.4 million access lines were in Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas and Washington. The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys telephone operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Local service $ 754,063 604,580 491,529 Network access 1,135,223 972,303 874,458 Other 182,694 156,709 139,746 2,071,980 1,733,592 1,505,733 Operating expenses Plant operations 505,786 433,187 380,466 Customer operations 167,594 148,502 117,080 Corporate and other 259,635 211,924 186,483 Depreciation and amortization 450,851 396,866 398,284 1,383,866 1,190,479 1,082,313 Operating income $ 688,114 543,113 423,420 Local service revenues. Local service revenues are derived from the provision of local exchange telephone services in the Companys service areas. Of the $149.5 million (24.7%) increase in local service revenues in 2003, $130.1 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in the third quarter of 2002. Of the remaining $19.4 million increase, $8.4 million was due to the provision of custom calling features to more customers and $5.9 million was due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions. Of the $113.1 million (23.0%) increase in local service revenues in 2002, $102.8 million was due to the acquisition of the Verizon properties in 2002. The remaining $10.3 million increase was primarily due to a $7.6 million increase resulting from the provision of custom calling features to more customers and a $1.8 million increase due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions. Access lines declined 38,400 (1.6%) during 2003 compared to a decline of 19,600 (1.1%) in 2002 (exclusive of acquisitions). The Company believes the decline in the number of access lines during 2003 and 2002 is primarily due to general economic conditions in the Companys markets and the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services, including the Companys DSL product offering. Even as the economy recovers, the Company believes that any rebound in access lines will be limited by continued access line losses caused primarily by the impact of other competitive services. Based on current conditions, the Company expects access lines to decline between 1 and 2% for 2004. Network access revenues. Network access revenues are primarily derived from charges to long distance companies and other customers for access to the Companys local exchange carrier ("LEC") networks in connection with the completion of interstate or intrastate voice and data transmissions. Certain of the Companys interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues increased $162.9 million (16.8%) in 2003 and $97.8 million (11.2%) in 2002 due to the following factors: 2003 2002 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Acquisitions of Verizon properties in third quarter 2002 $ 146,941 98,014 Increased recovery from the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") 250 13,832 One time refund of access charges to interexchange carriers 7,645 (7,645) Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use and decreased access rates in certain states (6,798) (27,740) Partial recovery of increased operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, increased recovery from state support funds and return on rate base 4,116 9,756 Rate changes in certain jurisdictions 2,472 5,600 Revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements 9,983 1,912 Other, net (1,689) 4,116 $ 162,920 97,845 As indicated in the chart above, in 2003 the Company experienced a reduction in its intrastate revenues (exclusive of the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) of approximately $6.8 million primarily due to (i) a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and electronic mail services) and (ii) decreased access rates in certain states. The corresponding decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 was $27.7 million. The Company believes intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2004, although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated. The Company anticipates that revenue derived from its revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements will be lower in 2004 compared to 2003 levels. Other revenues. Other revenues include revenues related to (i) leasing, selling, installing, maintaining and repairing customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring ("CPE services"), (ii) providing billing and collection services for long distance carriers and (iii) participating in the publication of local directories. Other revenues increased $26.0 million (16.6%) during 2003, substantially all of which is due to the properties acquired from Verizon in the third quarter of 2002. Other revenues increased $17.0 million (12.1%) in 2002, of which $18.2 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002. Operating expenses. Plant operations expenses during 2003 and 2002 increased $72.6 million (16.8%) and $52.7 million (13.9%), respectively. Of the $72.6 million increase in 2003, $74.8 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in the third quarter of 2002. The remaining $2.2 million decrease was due to a $5.7 million decrease in information technology expenses and a $5.2 million decrease in repair and maintenance expenses. Such decreases were partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in access expenses and $4.7 million increase in salaries and benefits. Of the $52.7 million increase in 2002, $58.4 million was attributable to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002 and $13.8 million related to increases in salaries and benefits. Such increases were partially offset by a $16.4 million decrease in access expenses primarily as a result of changes in certain optional calling plans in Arkansas approved in late 2001 and a $3.0 million decrease in repairs and maintenance expense. Customer operations, corporate and other expenses increased $66.8 million (18.5%) in 2003 and $56.9 million (18.7%) in 2002. Of the $66.8 million increase in 2003, $65.4 million related to the Verizon acquisitions in 2002. The remaining increase of $1.4 million was due primarily to (i) a $14.0 million increase in operating taxes, which included a $7.5 million charge arising out of various operating tax audits in 2003, and (ii) a $6.7 million increase in information technology expenses largely attributable to the Companys development of the new billing system described below under "Development of Billing System". Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $16.0 million decrease in the provision for uncollectible receivables (as 2002 was adversely impacted by the establishment of a $15.0 million reserve for uncollectible receivables primarily related to the bankruptcy of MCI (formerly WorldCom, Inc.), whereas 2003 was positively impacted by a $5.0 million reduction in the provision for uncollectible receivables due to the partial recovery of amounts previously written off related to the bankruptcy of MCI) and (ii) a $4.6 million decrease in customer service expenses. Of the $56.9 million increase in 2002, $47.2 million related to the Verizon acquisitions in 2002. The remaining increase of $9.7 million was due primarily to a $7.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, a $4.6 million increase in customer service expenses and a $3.9 million increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables (attributable to the above mentioned establishment of a $15.0 million reserve for uncollectible receivables primarily related to the bankruptcy of MCI which was partially offset by an $11.1 million reduction in the provision for uncollectible receivables for non carrier customers). Such increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in operating taxes and a $1.4 million decrease in expenses related to the provision of CPE services. Depreciation and amortization increased $54.0 million (13.6%) in 2003 and decreased $1.4 million (0.4%) in 2002. Of the $54.0 million increase in 2003, $50.9 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002. The remaining increase is primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense due to higher levels of plant in service in incumbent markets. Of the $1.4 million decrease in 2002, $58.0 million related to ceasing amortization of goodwill effective January 1, 2002 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. Such decrease was substantially offset by $38.0 million of depreciation and amortization related to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002 and a $21.8 million increase in depreciation expense due to higher levels of plant in service in incumbent markets. The composite depreciation rate for the Companys telephone properties was 7.0% for 2003, 6.9% for 2002 and 6.8% for 2001. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact the Companys telephone operations, see "Regulation and Competition". Other Operations Other operations includes the results of continuing operations of subsidiaries of the Company which are not included in the telephone segment including, but not limited to, the Companys non regulated long distance operations, Internet operations, competitive local exchange carrier ("CLEC") operations and fiber transport operations. During 2003, the Company paid $55.2 million cash to acquire fiber transport assets in five central U.S. states (which the Company operates under the name LightCore). The operating revenues, expenses and income of the Companys other operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001 are summarized below. Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues Long distance $ 173,884 146,536 117,363 Internet 79,933 58,665 39,057 Other 54,948 33,203 17,351 308,765 238,404 173,771 Operating expenses Cost of sales and operating expenses 226,693 180,076 142,919 Depreciation and amortization 19,790 14,760 8,754 246,483 194,836 151,673 Operating income $ 62,282 43,568 22,098 Long distance revenues increased $27.3 million (18.7%) and $29.2 million (24.9%) in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The $27.3 million increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to the growth in the number of customers and increased minutes of use ($32.6 million), primarily due to penetration of the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002. Such increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate charged by the Company ($5.3 million). The $29.2 million increase in 2002 was primarily attributable to the growth in the number of customers and increased average minutes of use ($34.8 million), partially offset by a decrease in the average rate charged by the Company per minute of use ($5.8 million). The Company anticipates that increased competition will continue to place downward pressure on rates. The number of long distance customers as of December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was approximately 769,760, 648,790, and 465,870, respectively. Internet revenues increased $21.3 million (36.3%) in 2003 and $19.6 million (50.2%) in 2002 due primarily to growth in the number of customers, principally due to the expansion of the Companys DSL product offering. Other revenues increased $21.7 million (65.5%) primarily due to (i) $16.7 million of revenues associated with the Companys LightCore operations and (ii) a $4.3 million increase in revenues in the Companys CLEC business primarily due to an increased number of customers, including those acquired in connection with the purchase of certain CLEC operations on February 28, 2002. Other revenues increased $15.9 million in 2002, of which $15.1 million was due to increased revenues in the Companys CLEC business, primarily due to the above referenced CLEC acquisition in early 2002. Cost of sales and operating expenses increased $46.6 million (25.9%) in 2003 primarily due to (i) a $14.6 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys long distance operations (of which $7.4 million was due to increased payments to other carriers due to higher minutes of use partially offset by a decrease in the rate per minute of use; $2.8 million was due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts; and $2.4 million was due to an increase in billing and collection costs); (ii) a $16.4 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys Internet operations due to an increase in the number of customers; and (iii) a $10.4 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys LightCore operations. Cost of sales and operating expenses increased $37.2 million (26.0%) in 2002 primarily due to (i) a $23.9 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys long distance operations (of which $13.4 million was due to increased payments to other carriers due to higher minutes of use partially offset by a decrease in the rate per minute of use; $5.3 million was related to increased sales and marketing costs; $2.2 million was due to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts; and $2.3 million was due to an increase in billing and collection costs); (ii) an $11.8 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys CLEC operations primarily due to the expansion of the business and operations acquired in the first quarter of 2002; and (iii) a $12.3 million increase associated with expanding the Companys Internet operations due to an increase in customers. Such increases were partially offset by a $7.4 million reduction in expenses primarily due to the increased intercompany profit with regulated affiliates (the recognition of which in accordance with regulatory accounting principles acts to offset operating expenses). Depreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million in 2003 and $6.0 million in 2002 primarily due to increased depreciation expense in the Companys CLEC and fiber transport businesses (including LightCore). Certain of the Companys service subsidiaries provide managerial, operational, technical, accounting and administrative services, along with materials and supplies, to the Companys telephone subsidiaries. In accordance with regulatory accounting, intercompany profit on transactions with regulated affiliates has not been eliminated in connection with consolidating the results of operations of the Company. When the regulated operations of the Company no longer qualify for the application of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"), such intercompany profit will be eliminated in subsequent financial statements, the primary result of which will be a decrease in operating expenses applicable to the Companys telephone operations and an increase in operating expenses applicable to the Companys other operations. The amount of intercompany profit with regulated affiliates which was not eliminated was approximately $28.5 million, $29.5 million and $22.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. For additional information applicable to SFAS 71, see "Regulation and Competition Other Matters." INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased $4.9 million in 2003 primarily due to $7.5 million of interest associated with various operating tax audits. Such increase was partially offset by reduced interest expense due to a decrease in average debt outstanding. Interest expense decreased $3.7 million in 2002 due to a decrease in average debt outstanding and decreased rates. INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED CELLULAR ENTITY Income from unconsolidated cellular entity was $6.2 million in 2003, $5.6 million in 2002 and $7.6 million in 2001. Such income represents the Companys share of income from its 49% interest in a cellular partnership. NONRECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES, NET In 2002, the Company recorded a pre tax gain of $3.7 million from the sale of a PCS license. In 2001, the Companys net favorable nonrecurring pre tax gains were $33.0 million. The Company recorded a pre tax gain on the sale of its remaining shares of Illuminet Holdings, Inc. ("Illuminet") common stock aggregating $54.6 million ($35.5 million after tax; $.25 per diluted share) and a pre tax gain of $4.0 million ($2.6 million after tax; $.02 per diluted share) on the sale of certain other assets. Additionally in 2001, the Company recorded pre tax charges of $25.5 million ($16.6 million after tax; $.12 per diluted share) due to the write down in the value of certain non operating investments in which the Company owns a minority interest. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE Other income and (expense) was $2.2 million in 2003, ($63.8 million) in 2002 and $32,000 in 2001. Included in 2002 was a $59.9 million pre tax charge related to the Companys payment of premium in connection with redeeming its Series I remarketable notes, net of unamortized premium. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Companys effective income tax rate (from continuing operations) was 35.2%, 35.3% and 38.0% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to the effect of ceasing amortization of goodwill (some of which was nondeductible for tax purposes) effective January 1, 2002 in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142. In 2003, the Company reduced the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards as it was more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to enable the Company to utilize a portion of the operating loss carryforwards. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. The Company expects its effective income tax rate to increase in 2004 due to an increase in the effective state income tax rate. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to Alltel and certain other purchasers for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion in cash. As a result, the Companys wireless operations for 2002 have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The results of operations for 2001 have been restated to conform to the 2002 presentation. The following table summarizes certain information concerning the Companys wireless operations for the periods presented. Year ended December 31, 2002 2001 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues $ 246,705 437,965 Operating expenses, exclusive of corporate overhead costs of $11.3 million and $20.2 million (175,447) (305,351) Income from unconsolidated cellular entities 25,768 19,868 Minority interest expense (8,569) (11,510) Gain on sale of discontinued operations 803,905 Nonrecurring gains 166,928 Other income 188 4,707 Income tax expense (284,459) (118,657) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 608,091 193,950 Included in operating expenses for 2002 is a $30.5 million charge associated with a write off of all amounts expended to develop the wireless portion of the Companys billing system currently in development. Depreciation and amortization of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles related to the Companys wireless operations ceased effective March 19, 2002, the date of the Companys definitive sales agreement with Alltel. Such cessation of depreciation and amortization had the effect of reducing depreciation and amortization expense approximately $20 million in 2002. The Company recorded an $803.9 million pre tax gain on the sale of substantially all of its wireless business in the third quarter of 2002. Nonrecurring gains for 2001 relate to the sale of 30 PCS licenses to Leap Wireless International, Inc. For further information, see Notes 3 and 13 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS On July 1, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 300,000 telephone access lines in the state of Alabama from Verizon for approximately $1.022 billion cash. On August 31, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 350,000 telephone access lines in the state of Missouri from Verizon for approximately $1.179 billion cash. On May 6, 2002, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units. Net proceeds to the Company from this issuance were approximately $483.4 million. Each of the 20 million equity units issued was priced at $25 and consists initially of a beneficial interest in a CenturyTel senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel common stock no later than May 2005. The senior notes mature in May 2007. Each purchase contract will generally require the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel common stock in May 2005 based on the then current price of CenturyTel common stock in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. Accordingly, upon full settlement of the purchase contracts in May 2005, the Company will receive proceeds of $500 million and will deliver between 13.9 million and 17.5 million common shares in the aggregate. The senior notes are pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contracts. The total distributions on the equity units will be at an initial annual rate of 6.875%, consisting of interest (6.02%) and contract adjustment payments (0.855%), each payable quarterly. On or after mid February 2005, the senior notes will be remarketed, at which time the remarketing agent will reset the interest rate on the senior notes in order to generate sufficient proceeds to secure the holders obligation under the purchase contract. In the event of an unsuccessful remarketing, the Company will exercise its right as a secured party to dispose of the senior notes and satisfy in full the holders obligation to purchase common stock under the purchase contract. On July 22, 2002, the Company entered into $800 million of credit facilities, consisting of a $533 million three year facility and a $267 million 364 day revolving facility which lapsed during 2003. These facilities replaced credit facilities that matured during the third quarter of 2002. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued $500 million of senior notes due 2012 (which bear interest at 7.875%) and $165 million of convertible senior debentures (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion price of $40.455 per share). The Company used proceeds from the sale of equity units, senior notes and convertible senior debentures, along with the $1.59 billion cash proceeds received from the sale of substantially all of the Companys wireless operations and utilization of its credit facilities, to finance the third quarter 2002 acquisitions of telephone properties in Alabama and Missouri from Verizon which aggregated $2.201 billion, the redemption of $400 million principal amount in remarketable debt securities (plus an associated $71.1 million premium payment) in October 2002, and the Companys fourth quarter 2002 estimated tax payment, which aggregated $290 million and included the obligation to pay taxes associated with the sale of substantially all of its wireless operations. In June and December 2003, the Company purchased certain fiber transport assets for an aggregate of approximately $55.2 million. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company acquired an additional 24.3% interest in a telephone company in which it owned a majority interest for $32.4 million cash. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although the Company generally has had no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the Companys telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"), have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires the Company to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. For the Companys telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 and its other operations (neither of which are subject to SFAS 71), the Company has not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs in the past. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"), which provides standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and for pre existing instruments as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 148"). SFAS 148, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as allowed by SFAS 123. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") reached a consensus on EITF 00 21, "Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Element Deliverables." This release addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services or rights to use assets. Under this release, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value. The final consensus was applicable to agreements entered into in periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00 21 did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) purchase price allocation, (iv) pension and postretirement benefits and (v) long lived assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. Certain of the Companys telephone subsidiaries participate in revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies for interstate revenue and for certain intrastate revenue. Under such sharing arrangements, which are typically administered by quasi governmental agencies, participating telephone companies contribute toll revenue or access charges within state jurisdictions and access charges in the interstate market. These revenues are pooled by the administrative agencies and used to reimburse exchange carriers for their costs. Typically, participating companies have 24 months to update or correct data previously submitted. As a result, revenues earned through the various sharing arrangements are initially recorded based on the Companys estimates. Historically, revisions of previous revenue estimates have not been material. Certain of the Companys telephone subsidiaries file tariffs directly with the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") for certain interstate revenues. Generally, the Company records such revenue at the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC. If amounts are billed in excess of the authorized rate of return, such excess is subject to refund upon request from other telecommunications carriers and customers. Amounts not requested for refund by carriers or customers are recognized as revenues at the end of the settlement period, which is generally 33 months subsequent to the two year monitoring periods. See Note 19 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for additional information. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable, the Company assesses a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, the Company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount the Company ultimately expects to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the Companys past collection experience is no longer relevant, the Companys estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Purchase price allocation. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, the Company allocated the aggregate purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair value at the date of acquisition. The fair value of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets was determined by an independent appraisal of such assets. The fair value of the postretirement benefit obligation was determined through actuarial valuations. The fair value of current assets and current liabilities was assumed to approximate the recorded value at acquisition due to their short maturity. The remaining unallocated acquisition cost was considered goodwill. Pension and postretirement benefits. The amounts recognized in the financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption used in determining the Companys pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2003, the Company lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to 8.25%, reflecting the expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets. For 2002, such expected return was assumed to be 10%. Another assumption used in the determination of the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate, which is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate bonds. The Company lowered its assumed discount rate to 6.0% at December 31, 2003 from 6.75% at December 31, 2002. Changes in the discount rate do not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. See "Pension and Medical Costs" for additional information. Intangible and long lived assets. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company was subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two new accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. The Company completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2003) under SFAS 142 and determined its goodwill is not impaired as of such date. Prior to January 1, 2002, substantially all of the Companys goodwill was amortized over 40 years. The Companys amortization of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2001 totaled approximately $69.2 million. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. For additional information on the Companys critical accounting policies, see "Accounting Pronouncements" and "Regulation and Competition Other Matters", and the footnotes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. INFLATION The effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the Companys ability to recover certain costs over time applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. Possible future regulatory changes and the continued movement toward alternative forms of regulation for intrastate operations may alter the Companys ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes are limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. For additional information regarding the current regulatory environment, see "Regulation and Competition." As operating expenses in the Companys nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, the Company, to the extent permitted by competition, attempts to recover the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment. MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations. The Company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2003, the fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated to be $3.4 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the Companys long term debt of 6.4% and an overall weighted maturity of 10 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 64 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of the Companys overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $143.9 million decrease in the fair value of the Companys long term debt. As of December 31, 2003, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 84% of the Companys long term debt obligations were fixed rate. The Company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, the Company uses derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2003, the Company had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series L senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are "fixed to variable" interest rate swaps that effectively convert the Companys fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 3.229% to the six month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August 2012. At December 31, 2003, the Company realized a rate under these hedges of 4.8%. Interest expense was reduced by $7.7 million during 2003 as a result of these hedges. The aggregate fair market value of these hedges was $11.7 million at December 31, 2003 and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in the Companys underlying long term debt on the December 31, 2003 balance sheet. With respect to these hedges, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $17.8 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges. Effective May 8, 2003, the Company terminated a fair value interest rate hedge associated with $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series H senior notes and received $22.3 million cash upon settlement, which represented the fair value of the hedge at the termination date. Such amount will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense through 2010, the maturity date of the Series H notes. DEVELOPMENT OF BILLING SYSTEM The Company is in the process of developing an integrated billing and customer care system which will provide the Company with, in addition to standard billing functionality currently being provided by its legacy system, custom built hardware and software technology for more efficient and effective customer care, billing and provisioning systems. The costs to develop such system have been accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" ("SOP 98 1"). The capitalized costs of the system aggregated $163.5 million (before accumulated amortization) at December 31, 2003. The Company began amortizing its billing system costs in early 2003 (over a 20 year period) based on the total number of customers that the Company has migrated to the new system. The system remains in the development stage and has required substantially more time and money to develop than originally anticipated. The Company currently expects to complete all phases of the new system no later than mid 2005 at an aggregate capitalized cost in accordance with SOP 98 1 of approximately $200 215 million (exclusive of previously disclosed write offs). In addition, the Company expects to incur additional costs related to completion of the project, including (i) approximately $15 million of customer service related and data conversion costs (the majority of which are expected to be incurred in 2004) that will be expensed as incurred and (ii) $10 million of capitalized hardware costs (which will be amortized over a three year period). The estimates above do not include any amounts for maintenance or on going support of either the old or new system, and are based on assumptions regarding various future events, several of which are beyond the Companys control. There is no assurance that the system will be completed in accordance with this schedule or budget, or that the system will function as anticipated. If the system does not function as anticipated, the Company may have to write off part or all of its development costs and further explore its other billing and customer care system alternatives. PENSION AND MEDICAL COSTS During the past several years, the Companys employee benefit expenses, including defined benefit pension expenses and pre and post retirement medical expenses, have increased due to rising medical costs, the decline of equity markets in recent years prior to 2003 and record low interest rates. During 2003, such costs (including the effect of the Verizon acquisitions in 2002) increased approximately $19.3 million over 2002. As a result of continued increases in medical costs, the Company discontinued its practice of subsidizing post retirement medical benefits for persons hired on or after January 1, 2003. In addition, the Company announced changes, effective January 1, 2004, that would decrease its subsidization of benefits provided under its postretirement medical plan. The amount of the Companys cost savings will be dependent upon several factors, including the age and years of service of the Companys retirees. The Company also lowered its expected long term return on plan assets for its pension and post retirement plans to 8.25% for 2003 compared to 10% for 2002. Pension and medical costs are anticipated to increase between $6 8 million in 2004 compared to 2003 levels. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, the Company relies on cash provided by operations to provide for its cash needs. The Companys operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped the Company continue its long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1.068 billion, $793.4 million and $572.9 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Companys accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional information relating to the continuing and discontinued operations of the Company, see Results of Operations. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $464.6 million, $2.623 billion and $417.2 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions was $86.2 million in 2003 (primarily due to the acquisitions of fiber transport assets and the acquisition of an additional 24.3% interest in a telephone company in which the Company owns a majority interest), $2.245 billion in 2002 (substantially all of which relates to the 2002 Verizon acquisitions) and $47.1 million in 2001. Proceeds from the sales of assets were $4.1 million in 2002 (excluding the Companys 2002 wireless divestiture) and $58.2 million in 2001. Capital expenditures from continuing operations for 2003 were $317.4 million for telephone operations and $60.6 million for other operations. Capital expenditures from continuing operations during 2002 and 2001 were $386.3 million and $435.5 million, respectively. Financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations was ($403.8) million in 2003, $506.3 million in 2002 and ($395.4) million in 2001. Net payments of debt were $432.3 million in 2003. Proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of debt payments, were $531.4 million during 2002, compared to net payments of debt of $375.6 million during 2001. On May 6, 2002, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units. Net proceeds to the Company from this issuance were approximately $483.4 million. Each of the 20 million equity units issued was priced at $25 and consists initially of a beneficial interest in a CenturyTel senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel common stock no later than May 2005. The senior notes will mature in May 2007. Each stock purchase contract will generally require the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel common stock in May 2005 in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. The total distributions on the equity units will be at an initial annual rate of 6.875%, consisting of interest (6.02%) and contract adjustment payments (0.855%). For additional information, see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. On July 22, 2002, the Company entered into $800 million of credit facilities, consisting of a $533 million three year facility and a $267 million 364 day revolving facility with a one year term out option. The Company did not renew its $267 million 364 day facility in 2003. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued $500 million of senior notes due 2012 (which bear interest at 7.875%) and $165 million of convertible senior debentures (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion price of $40.455 per share). Holders of the convertible senior debentures will have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on August 1, 2006, August 1, 2010 and August 1, 2017 at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to Alltel and certain other purchasers for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion cash. The Company used proceeds from the sale of equity units, senior notes and convertible senior debentures, along with the proceeds received from the sale of the Companys wireless operations and utilization of its $800 million credit facilities, to finance the third quarter 2002 acquisitions of telephone properties in Alabama and Missouri from Verizon which aggregated $2.201 billion, the redemption of $400 million principal amount in remarketable debt securities (plus an associated $71.1 million premium payment) in October 2002 and the Companys fourth quarter 2002 estimated tax payment, which aggregated $290 million and included the obligation to pay taxes associated with the sale of substantially all of its wireless operations. In second quarter 2001, the Company completed the sale of 30 PCS operating licenses for an aggregate of $195 million to Leap Wireless International, Inc. The Company received approximately $108 million of the purchase price in cash at closing and the remainder was collected in installments through the fourth quarter of 2001. Such proceeds, and the proceeds from the Companys above described divestiture of its wireless operations in 2002, are included as net cash provided by discontinued operations on the statements of cash flows appearing elsewhere in this report. In third quarter 2001, the Company sold its remaining shares of its investment in Illuminet common stock for an aggregate of approximately $58.2 million. Proceeds from these sales were used to repay indebtedness. Other. Budgeted capital expenditures for 2004 total $290 million for telephone operations and $110 million for other operations. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in its telephone operations will continue to include the upgrading of its plant and equipment, including its digital switches, to provide enhanced services, particularly in its newly acquired markets, and the installation of fiber optic cable. The following table contains certain information concerning the Companys material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003. Payments due by period Less than After Contractual obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations $ 3,181,755 72,453 523,952 (1) 805,397 (2) 1,779,953 (1) Includes $165 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys convertible debentures, Series K, due 2032, which can be put to the Company at various dates beginning in 2006. (2) Includes $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys senior notes, Series J, due 2007, which the Company is committed to remarket in 2005. On February 3, 2004, the Company announced that its board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that will allow the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $400 million of either its common stock or convertible equity units prior to December 31, 2005. The Company commenced purchases under this plan on February 6, 2004. The Company continually evaluates the possibility of acquiring additional telecommunications operations and expects to continue its long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractive communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. The Company generally does not announce its acquisitions or dispositions until it has entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. The Company may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of CenturyTel common stock and 200,000 shares of CenturyTel preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under CenturyTels acquisition shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had available $533.0 million of undrawn committed bank lines of credit and the Companys telephone subsidiaries had available for use $123.0 million of commitments for long term financing from the Rural Utilities Service and Rural Telephone Bank. The Company has a commercial paper program that authorizes the Company to have outstanding up to $1.5 billion in commercial paper at any one time; however, borrowings are limited to the amount available under its credit facility. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding under such program. The Company also has access to debt and equity capital markets, including its shelf registration statements. At December 31, 2003, the Company held over $203 million of cash and cash equivalents. Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys") rates CenturyTels long term debt Baa2 (with a stable outlook) and Standard & Poors ("S&P") rates CenturyTels long term debt BBB+ (with a stable outlook). The Companys commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Any downgrade in the Companys ratings could adversely impact the Companys ability to issue commercial paper or use its bank facility.

These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of the Companys telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. During 2003, the FCC released new rules which outline the obligations of incumbent LECs to lease elements of their circuit switched networks on an unbundled basis to competitors. The new framework eliminates the prior obligation of incumbent LECs to lease their high speed data lines to competitors. Incumbent LECs will remain obligated to offer other telecommunications services to resellers at wholesale rates. These wholesale rates are based on a forward looking cost model and other terms that substantially limit the profitability of these arrangements to incumbent LECs. This new rule also provides for a significant role of state regulatory commissions in implementing these new guidelines and establishing wholesale service rates. On March 2, 2004, a federal district court of appeals overturned the rules previously adopted by the FCC requiring LECs to provide competitors with discounted access to the LECs networks. The court also ruled that the FCC should not have given states the authority previously granted. It is expected that such decision will be appealed to the Supreme Court. During 2003, the FCC also sought public comments on whether it should make additional changes to its interconnection regulations, and instituted a comprehensive review of its methodologies for establishing wholesale rates. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the gradual reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. Wireless services entities also increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LECs. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies. The FCC adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period, effective July 1, 2001, based on embedded, or historical, costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers, including substantially all of the Companys local exchange carriers. During 2003 and 2002 the Companys telephone subsidiaries received $199.2 million and $192.4 million, respectively, from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund, representing 8.4% and 9.8%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated revenues from continuing operations for 2003 and 2002. The Company anticipates its 2004 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund will be lower than 2003 levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. Wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications carrier ("ETC") status in order to be eligible to receive Universal Service Fund support, which is placing additional financial pressure on the amount of money needed to provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments the Company receives from the High Cost Loop Fund. As a result of the limited growth in the size of the High Cost Loop Fund and changes in requests for support from the Universal Service Fund, the Company has no assurance it will continue to receive payments from the Universal Service Fund commensurate with those received in the past. In 2001, the FCC modified its interstate access charge rules and universal service support system for rate of return LECs. This order, among other things, (i) increased the caps on the subscriber line charges ("SLC") to the levels paid by most subscribers nationwide; (ii) allowed limited SLC deaveraging, which enhanced the competitiveness of rate of return carriers by giving them pricing flexibility; (iii) lowered per minute rates collected for federal access charges; (iv) created a new explicit universal service support mechanism that replaced other implicit support mechanisms in a manner designed to ensure that rate structure changes do not affect the overall recovery of interstate access costs by rate of return carriers serving high cost areas; and (v) preserved the historic 11.25% authorized interstate return rate for rate of return LECs. The effect of this order on the Company was revenue neutral for interstate purposes but did result in a reduction in intrastate revenues in Arkansas and Ohio (where intrastate access rates must mirror the interstate access rates). Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several large cable television and telephone companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers route calls over the Internet, without use of ILECs circuit switches and, in certain cases, without use of ILECs networks to carry their communications traffic. VoIP providers can offer services at prices substantially below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services for several reasons, including lower network cost structures and the current ability of VoIP providers to use ILECs networks without paying access charges. In December 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking that is expected to address the effect of VoIP on intercarrier compensation, universal service and emergency services. There can be no assurance that this rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for the Companys customers. In November 2003, the FCC adopted rules requiring companies to allow their customers to keep their wireline or wireless phone number when switching to another service provider (generally referred to as "local number portability"). For several years, customers have been able to retain their numbers when switching their local service between wireline carriers. The new rules now require local number portability between wireline and wireless carriers. This requirement went into effect November 24, 2003 for wireline carriers in the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSAs"). The new requirement will go into effect May 24, 2004 for wireline carriers operating in markets smaller than the top 100 MSAs. The majority of the Companys wireline operations are conducted in markets below the top 100 MSAs. Local number portability may increase the number of customers who chose to completely forego the use of traditional wireline phone service, although the Company believes that it is too early to fully assess the rules impact. The costs to comply with the requirements of local number portability, net of the amount that is recoverable through the ratemaking process, are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. The FCC is currently examining several issues that could have a substantial impact on the Companys revenues, including a broad inquiry initiated in 2001 into all currently regulated forms of intercarrier compensation. As discussed further below, certain providers of competitive communications services are not required to compensate ILECs for the use of their networks. The Company relies on access revenues as an important source of revenues. Depending on the final outcome of the FCCs intercarrier compensation issue, the Company could suffer a material loss of access revenues. Recent events affecting the Company. During the last few years, several states in which the Company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the Companys service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. State alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the Companys LECs have also affected revenue growth recently. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that the Company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its LECs. In addition, the Company has recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and electronic mail services. In 2003 the Company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues (exclusive of the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) of approximately $6.8 million compared to 2002 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease in 2002 compared to 2001 was $27.7 million. The Company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2004, although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated. In January 2003, the Louisiana Public Service Commission directed its staff to review the feasibility of converting the $42 million Louisiana Local Optional Service Fund ("LOS Fund") into a state universal service fund. Currently, the LOS Fund is funded primarily by BellSouth, which proposes to expand the base of contributors into the LOS Fund. A recommendation by the Commission staff is not expected until late 2004. The Company currently receives approximately $21 million from the LOS Fund each year. There can be no assurance that this funding will remain at current levels. Competition to provide traditional telephone services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural, suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the Companys telephone operations are located. Although the Company does not believe that the increased competition it has thus far experienced is likely to materially affect it in the near term, the Company anticipates that regulatory, technological and competitive changes will result in future revenue reductions. The Company expects its telephone revenues to decline in 2004 due to continued access line losses and reduced network access revenues; however, the Company expects its consolidated revenues to increase in 2004 primarily due to increased revenues from its newly acquired LightCore operations and expected increased demand for its long distance, fiber transport, DSL and other nonregulated product offerings. Other matters. The Companys regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. The Company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to its regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the Companys telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71" ("SFAS 101"), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. The Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 included regulatory assets of approximately $3.3 million (primarily deferred costs related to financing costs, regulatory proceedings and income taxes) and regulatory liabilities of approximately $912,000 (related to income taxes). Net deferred income tax liabilities related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $1.2 million. When and if the Companys regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, the Company does not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of its regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, the Company would be required to revise the lives of its property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company does not expect such revisions in asset lives to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of the Companys telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. The Company has certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2003 have not been material, and the Company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
