Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Overview CenturyTel, Inc. ("CenturyTel") and its subsidiaries (the "Company") is an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange, long distance, Internet access and broadband services to customers in 22 states. The Company currently derives its revenues from providing (i) local exchange telephone services, (ii) network access services, (iii) long distance services, (iv) data services, which includes both dial up and digital subscriber line ("DSL") Internet services, as well as special access and private line services, (v) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and (vi) other related services. The Company strives to maintain its customer relationships by, among other things, bundling its service offerings to provide its customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services. Effective in the first quarter of 2004, as a result of the Companys increased focus on integrated bundle offerings and the varied discount structures associated with such offerings, the Company determined that its results of operations would be more appropriately reported as a single reportable segment under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." Therefore, the results of operations for 2004 reflect the presentation of a single reportable segment. Results of operations for 2003 and 2002 have been conformed to the Companys 2004 presentation of a single reportable segment. In connection with the change in segment reporting, the Company has, among other things, (i) eliminated certain revenues arising out of previously reported intersegment transactions (which reduced operating expenses by a like amount and therefore had no impact on operating income), (ii) reclassified certain revenues to conform to the new revenue components and (iii) reclassified depreciation expense related to certain service subsidiaries of the Company from operating expenses of its regulated operations to depreciation expense. On July 1, 2002, the Company acquired the local exchange telephone operations of Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") in the state of Alabama for approximately $1.022 billion cash. On August 31, 2002, the Company acquired the local exchange telephone operations of Verizon in the state of Missouri for approximately $1.179 billion cash. The results of operations for the Verizon assets acquired are reflected in the Companys consolidated results of operations subsequent to each respective acquisition. See "Acquisitions" below and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2003, the Company also acquired fiber transport assets in five central U.S. states (which the Company operates under the name LightCore) for $55.2 million cash. On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations principally to an affiliate of ALLTEL Corporation ("Alltel") in exchange for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion in cash. As a result, the Companys wireless operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 has been reflected as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income and cash flows. For further information, see "Discontinued Operations" below. During the three years ended December 31, 2004, the Company has acquired and sold various other operations, the impact of which has not been material to the financial position or results of operations of the Company. The net income of the Company for 2004 was $337.2 million, compared to $344.7 million during 2003 and $801.6 million during 2002. Diluted earnings per share for 2004 was $2.41 compared to $2.35 in 2003 and $5.56 in 2002. Income from continuing operations (and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations) was $337.2 million ($2.41), $344.7 million ($2.35) and $193.5 million ($1.35) for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the application of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04 8 to all periods presented. See Note 13 for additional information. Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 753,953 750,396 575,406 Interest expense (211,051) (226,751) (221,845) Income from unconsolidated cellular entity 7,067 6,160 5,582 Nonrecurring gains and losses, net 3,709 Other income (expense) (2,597) 2,154 (63,814) Income tax expense (210,128) (187,252) (105,505) Income from continuing operations 337,244 344,707 193,533 Discontinued operations, net of tax 608,091 Net income $ 337,244 344,707 801,624 Basic earnings per share From continuing operations $ 2.45 2.40 1.36 From discontinued operations $ 4.29 Basic earnings per share $ 2.45 2.40 5.66 Diluted earnings per share From continuing operations $ 2.41 2.35 1.35 From discontinued operations $ 4.21 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.41 2.35 5.56 Average basic shares outstanding 137,215 143,583 141,613 Average diluted shares outstanding 142,144 148,779 144,408 Operating income increased $3.6 million in 2004 as a $39.8 million increase in operating revenues was substantially offset by a $36.2 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income increased $175.0 million in 2003 as a $395.6 million increase in operating revenues was partially offset by a $220.6 million increase in operating expenses. In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; the Companys ability to effectively manage its growth, including integrating newly acquired businesses into the Companys operations and hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Companys products and services; the Companys ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; the Companys ability to successfully take steps to mitigate the dilutive effect of the $500 million of equity units currently scheduled to settle in May 2005; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of the Companys filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to the business are described in greater detail in Item 1 included herein. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward looking statements for any reason. OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Local service $ 716,028 712,565 570,871 Network access 966,011 1,001,462 884,982 Long distance 186,997 173,884 146,536 Data 275,777 244,998 179,695 Fiber transport and CLEC 74,409 43,041 21,666 Other 188,150 191,660 168,246 Operating revenues $ 2,407,372 2,367,610 1,971,996 Local service revenues. Local service revenues are derived from the provision of local exchange telephone services in the Companys service areas. Of the $3.5 million (.5%) increase in local service revenues in 2004, $12.6 million was due to the provision of custom calling features to more customers, which was partially offset by an $8.4 million decrease due to the decline in access lines. Of the $141.7 million (24.8%) increase in local service revenues in 2003, $121.2 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in the third quarter of 2002. Of the remaining $20.5 million increase, $8.4 million was due to the provision of custom calling features to more customers and $5.9 million was due to increased rates in certain jurisdictions. Access lines declined 62,500 (2.6%) during 2004 compared to a decline of 38,400 (1.6%) in 2003. The Company believes the decline in the number of access lines during 2004 and 2003 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services, including the Companys DSL product offering. Based on current conditions, the Company expects access lines to decline between 2.5 and 3.5% for 2005. Network access revenues. Network access revenues primarily relate to (i) services provided by the Company to long distance carriers, wireless carriers and other carriers and customers in connection with the use of the Companys facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice and data transmissions and (ii) the receipt of universal support funds which allows the Company to recover a portion of its costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms. Certain of the Companys interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers ("LECs") administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues decreased $35.5 million (3.5%) in 2004 and increased $116.5 million (13.2%) in 2003 due to the following factors: 2004 2003 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Acquisitions of Verizon properties in third quarter 2002 $ 107,319 Recovery from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program (11,311) 250 One time refund of access charges to interexchange carriers in 2002 7,645 Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use and decreased access rates in certain states (25,916) (6,798) Partial recovery of increased operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues, increased recovery from state support funds and return on rate base 3,980 3,513 Rate changes in certain jurisdictions 5,052 2,472 Revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements (3,690) 7,368 Other, net (3,566) (5,289) $ (35,451) 116,480 As indicated in the chart above, in 2004 the Company experienced a reduction in its intrastate revenues of approximately $25.9 million primarily due to (i) a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services) and (ii) decreased access rates in certain states. The corresponding decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 was $6.8 million. The Company believes intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2005, although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated. The Company anticipates its 2005 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program will be approximately $10 15 million lower than 2004 levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all recipients. Long distance revenues. The Companys long distance revenues relate to the provision of retail long distance services to its customers. Long distance revenues increased $13.1 million (7.5%) and $27.3 million (18.7%) in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The $13.1 million increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to a 14.9% increase in the average number of long distance lines served and a 15.3% increase in minutes of use (aggregating $21.7 million), partially offset by a decrease in the average rate charged by the Company ($9.2 million). The $27.3 million increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to the 28.3% increase in the average number of long distance lines served and increased minutes of use ($32.6 million), primarily due to penetration of the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002. Such increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average rate charged by the Company ($5.3 million). The Company anticipates that increased competition and its current level of customer penetration will continue to place downward pressure on rates and slow the growth rate of the number of long distance lines served. Data revenues. Data revenues include revenues primarily related to the provision of Internet access services (both dial up and DSL services) and the provision of data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues increased $30.8 million (12.6%) in 2004 and $65.3 million (36.3%) in 2003. The $30.8 million increase in 2004 was primarily due to a $20.3 million increase in Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of customers, principally due to expansion of the Companys DSL product offering, and an $11.3 million increase in special access revenues due to an increase in the number of special circuits provided and an increase in the partial recovery of increased operating expenses through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies. The $65.3 million increase in 2003 was primarily due to (i) a $38.4 million increase due to the acquisition of the Verizon properties in 2002 and (ii) a $21.3 million increase in Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of customers in the Companys incumbent markets, principally due to expansion of the Companys DSL product offering. Fiber transport and CLEC. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from the Companys fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier ("CLEC") and security monitoring businesses. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $31.4 million (72.9%) in 2004 substantially all of which is attributable to the Companys acquisitions of fiber transport assets (which are operated under the name LightCore) in June and December 2003. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $21.4 million (98.7%) in 2003 primarily due to (i) $16.7 million of revenues associated with the acquisition of the Companys LightCore operations and (ii) a $4.3 million increase in revenues in the Companys CLEC business primarily due to an increased number of customers, including those acquired in connection with the purchase of certain CLEC operations on February 28, 2002. Other revenues. Other revenues include revenues related to (i)leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii) providing billing and collection services for long distance carriers and (iii) participating in the publication of local directories. Other revenues decreased $3.5 million (1.8%) during 2004 primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in directory revenues due to the expiration of the Companys rights to share in the revenues of yellow page directories published in certain markets acquired from Verizon in 2002. Other revenues increased $23.4 million (13.9%) in 2003, substantially all of which is due to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002. OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 755,413 739,210 635,164 Selling, general and administrative 397,102 374,352 301,681 Corporate overhead costs allocated to discontinued operations 9,548 Depreciation and amortization 500,904 503,652 450,197 Operating expenses $ 1,653,419 1,617,214 1,396,590 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $16.2 million (2.2%) in 2004 primarily due to (i) a $14.6 million increase in expenses associated with operating the Companys fiber transport assets acquired in June and December 2003; (ii) an $8.5 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys Internet operations due to an increase in the number of customers; (iii) a $7.8 million increase in customer service and retention related expenses; and (iv) a $6.0 million increase in plant operations expenses. Such increases were partially offset by a $13.8 million decrease in access expenses (which included a one time credit of $3.1 million recorded in 2004) and a $9.2 million decrease in the cost of providing retail long distance service primarily due to a decrease in the average cost per minute of use and a decrease in circuit costs. Cost of services and products increased $104.0 million (16.4%) in 2003 primarily due to (i) a $77.0 million increase due to the properties acquired from Verizon in the third quarter of 2002, (ii) an $11.1 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys Internet operations due to an increase in the number of customers, (iii) a $7.4 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys long distance operations (primarily attributable to higher minutes of use partially offset by a decrease in the rate per minute of use), (iv) a $6.3 million increase in expenses associated with operating the Companys LightCore assets acquired in 2003, and (v) a $4.8 million increase in access expenses. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.8 million (6.1%) in 2004 due to (i) a $9.0 million increase in marketing expenses; (ii) a $6.4 million increase in expenses attributable to the Companys Sarbanes Oxley internal controls compliance effort; (iii) a nonrecurring $5.0 million reduction in bad debt expense recorded in the first quarter of 2003 due to the partial recovery of amounts previously written off related to the bankruptcy of MCI (formerly WorldCom); and (iv) a $4.3 million increase in expenses associated with operating the Companys LightCore assets acquired in 2003. Such increases were partially offset by a $6.6 million decrease in bad debt expense (exclusive of the MCI recovery mentioned above). Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $72.7 million (24.1%) in 2003 due to (i) a $50.3 million increase related to the Verizon acquisitions in 2002, (ii) a $14.0 million increase in operating taxes, which included a $7.5 million charge arising out of various operating tax audits in 2003, (iii) a $6.7 million increase in information technology expenses largely attributable to the Companys development of the new billing system described below under "Development of Billing System", (iv) a $4.9 million increase associated with expanding the Companys Internet operations due to an increase in customers and (v) a $4.4 million increase in expenses associated with the Companys long distance operations (of which $2.4 million was due to an increase in billing and collection costs). Such increases were partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in the provision for uncollectible receivables (as 2002 was adversely impacted by the establishment of a $15.0 million reserve for uncollectible receivables primarily related to the bankruptcy of MCI (formerly WorldCom, Inc.), whereas 2003 was positively impacted by a $5.0 million reduction in the provision for uncollectible receivables due to the partial recovery of amounts previously written off related to the bankruptcy of MCI). Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.7 million (.5%) in 2004 and increased $53.5 million (11.9%) in 2003. The year 2004 included a reduction in depreciation expense of $13.2 million to adjust the balances of certain over depreciated property, plant and equipment accounts. In order to reduce the risk of similar event, in early 2005 the Company implemented automated controls to replace previous manual controls to ensure that depreciation ceases once an asset group is fully depreciated (after consideration of salvage and removal costs). Depreciation expense for 2004 was also reduced by $8.4 million due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by a $16.7 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service, a $3.1 million adjustment in 2004 related to depreciation of fixed assets related to the Companys new billing system, and a $3.0 million increase in depreciation due to the assets acquired in connection with the Companys LightCore operations. Of the $53.5 million increase in 2003, $50.9 million was due to the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002. The remaining increase is primarily due to increased depreciation expense in the Companys CLEC and fiber transport businesses (including LightCore) and higher levels of plant in service. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact the Companys operations, see "Regulation and Competition". INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $15.7 million (6.9%) in 2004 compared to 2003 partially due to $7.5 million of nonrecurring interest expense in 2003 associated with various operating tax audits. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding. Interest expense increased $4.9 million in 2003 primarily due to $7.5 million of interest associated with various operating tax audits. Such increase was partially offset by reduced interest expense due to a decrease in average debt outstanding. INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED CELLULAR ENTITY Income from unconsolidated cellular entity was $7.1 million in 2004, $6.2 million in 2003 and $5.6 million in 2002. Such income represents the Companys share of income from its 49% interest in a cellular partnership. NONRECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES, NET In 2002, the Company recorded a pre tax gain of $3.7 million from the sale of a Personal Communications Services license. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) was ($2.6 million) in 2004, $2.2 million in 2003 and ($63.8 million) in 2002. Included in 2004 was a $3.6 million prepayment expense paid in connection with the redemption of $100 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys Series B senior notes in May 2004 and a $2.5 million charge related to the impairment of a nonoperating investment, which amounts were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in interest income due to higher cash balances. Included in 2002 was a $59.9 million pre tax charge related to the Companys payment of premium in connection with redeeming its Series I remarketable notes, net of unamortized premium. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The Companys effective income tax rate (from continuing operations) was 38.4%, 35.2% and 35.3% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Income tax expense for 2003 was reduced by $21.6 million primarily as a result of reducing the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards as it was more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to enable the Company to utilize this portion of the operating loss carryforwards. For additional information, see Note 12 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to Alltel and certain other purchasers for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion in cash. As a result, the Companys wireless operations for 2002 have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes certain information concerning the Companys wireless operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. Year ended December 31, 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenues $ 246,705 Operating expenses, exclusive of corporate overhead costs of $9.5 million (175,447) Income from unconsolidated cellular entities 25,768 Minority interest expense (8,569) Gain on sale of discontinued operations 803,905 Other income 188 Income tax expense (284,459) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $ 608,091 Included above in operating expenses for 2002 is a $30.5 million charge associated with a write off of all amounts expended to develop the wireless portion of the Companys new billing system discussed below under "Development of Billing System". Depreciation and amortization of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles related to the Companys wireless operations ceased effective March 19, 2002, the date of the Companys definitive sales agreement with Alltel. Such cessation of depreciation and amortization had the effect of reducing depreciation and amortization expense of the Companys wireless operations approximately $20 million in 2002. The Company recorded an $803.9 million pre tax gain on the sale of substantially all of its wireless business in the third quarter of 2002. For further information, see Note 3 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04 8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share" ("EITF 04 8"). EITF 04 8 requires securities issuable under contingently convertible instruments be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. The Companys $165 million Series K senior notes are convertible into common stock under various contingent circumstances, including the common stock attaining a specified trading price in excess of the notes fixed conversion price. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Companys diluted earnings per share and diluted shares outstanding reflect the application of EITF 04 8. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting. The Company has elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation". In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), "Share Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)"). SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for the issuance of stock options. SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to measure the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date. Such cost will be recognized as an expense over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. SFAS 123(R) is effective for all awards granted after its effective date of July 1, 2005. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), compensation cost is also recognized over the applicable remaining vesting period for any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately $.03 in 2005. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although the Company generally has had no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the Companys telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"), have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires the Company to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, the Company did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for its telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. For the Companys telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject to SFAS 71) and its other non regulated operations, the Company has not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs in the past. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, "Accounting for Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity" ("SFAS 150"), which provides standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and for pre existing instruments as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits and (iv) long lived assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes that certain critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity, including those described below. Revenue recognition. Certain of the Companys interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company revised certain estimates for recognizing interstate revenues. Previously, the Company initially recognized interstate revenues at a rate of return lower than the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC to allow for potential decreases in demand or other factor changes which could decrease the achieved rate of return over the respective monitoring periods. As the monitoring periods progressed, the Company recorded additional revenues ratably up to the achieved rate of return. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company began generally recognizing such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless the actual achieved rate of return was lower than authorized. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been "deemed lawful" in effect nullify an interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC. Certain of the Companys telephone subsidiaries file interstate tariffs directly with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of the Companys earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability on the balance sheet for the combined 2001/2002 and 2003/2004 monitoring periods aggregated approximately $63 million. The settlement period related to (i) the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2005 and (ii) the 2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2007. The Company will continue to monitor the legal status of any pending or future proceedings that could impact its entitlement to these funds, and may recognize as revenue some or all of the over earnings at the end of the settlement period or as the legal status becomes more certain. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of its accounts receivable, the Company assesses a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to the Company, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, the Company records both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount the Company ultimately expects to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that the Companys past collection experience is no longer relevant, the Companys estimate of the recoverability of its accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in the Companys accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pension and postretirement benefits. The amounts recognized in the Companys financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption used in determining the Companys pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2003, the Company lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets to 8.25%, reflecting the expected moderation of long term rates of return in the financial markets, and used the same rate in 2004. Another assumption used in the determination of the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate, which is generally based on the yield on high quality corporate bonds. The Company lowered its assumed discount rate to 5.75% at December 31, 2004 from 6.0% at December 31, 2003. Changes in the discount rate are not generally expected to have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. Intangible and long lived assets. The Company is subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144"). SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. The Company completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2004) under SFAS 142 and determined its goodwill is not impaired as of such date. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. For additional information on the Companys critical accounting policies, see "Accounting Pronouncements" and "Regulation and Competition Other Matters", and the footnotes to the Companys consolidated financial statements. INFLATION The effects of increased costs historically have been mitigated by the Companys ability to recover certain costs over time applicable to its regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. However, LECs operating over 60% of the Companys total access lines are now governed by alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict or delay the Companys ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes may further alter the Companys ability to recover increased costs in its regulated operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes are limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. For additional information regarding the current regulatory environment, see "Regulation and Competition." As operating expenses in the Companys nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, the Company, to the extent permitted by competition, attempts to recover the costs by increasing prices for its services and equipment. MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on its long term debt obligations. The Company has estimated its market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of the Companys long term debt was estimated to be $3.1 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of the Companys long term debt of 6.5% and an overall weighted maturity of 10 years compared to terms and rates available on such date in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of the Companys long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 65 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of the Companys overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $119.9 million decrease in the fair value of the Companys long term debt. As of December 31, 2004, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 83% of the Companys long term debt obligations were fixed rate. The Company seeks to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, the Company uses derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap its exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. The Company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews the Companys exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series L senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are "fixed to variable" interest rate swaps that effectively convert the Companys fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 3.229% to the six month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August 2012. At December 31, 2004, the Company realized a rate under these hedges of 6.4%. Interest expense was reduced by $10.3 million during 2004 as a result of these hedges. The aggregate fair market value of these hedges was $5.7 million at December 31, 2004 and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in the Companys underlying long term debt on the December 31, 2004 balance sheet. With respect to these hedges, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $15.5 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges. As of December 31, 2004, the Company also had outstanding cash flow hedges that effectively locked in the interest rate on a majority of certain anticipated debt transactions that ultimately were completed in February 2005. The Company locked in the interest rate of (i) $100 million of 2.25 year debt (remarketed in February 2005) at 3.9% and (ii) $225 million of 10 year debt (issued in February 2005) at 5.5%. Such cash flow hedges had a fair value of $571,000 as of December 31, 2004 and are reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on the consolidated balance sheet. In January 2005, the Company also entered into a separate cash flow hedge which effectively locked in the interest rate for an additional $75 million of 10 year debt (issued in February 2005) at 5.4%. In February 2005, upon settlement of such hedges, the Company (i) received $366,000 related to the 2.25 year debt remarketing which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt and (ii) paid $7.7 million related to the 10 year debt issuance which will be amortized as an increase in interest expense over the 10 year term of the debt. Effective May 8, 2003, the Company terminated a fair value interest rate hedge associated with $500 million aggregate principal amount of its Series H senior notes and received $22.3 million cash upon settlement, which represented the fair value of the hedge at the termination date. Such amount is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense through 2010, the maturity date of the Series H notes. DEVELOPMENT OF BILLING SYSTEM The Company recently implemented a new integrated billing and customer care system. The costs to develop such system have been accounted for in accordance with Statement of Position 98 1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". The capitalized costs of the system aggregated $207 million (before accumulated amortization) at December 31, 2004 and are being amortized over a 20 year period. Virtually all of the Companys customers were converted to the new system in late 2004. In early 2005, the Company implemented software upgrades and other changes to enhance the productivity and efficiency of the system, the cost of which was not material. During the development phase of the new billing system, the Company capitalized payroll related costs of employees dedicated to the project. The Company began expensing these costs in late 2004, but does not expect the impact thereof to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, the Company relies on cash provided by operations to provide for its cash needs. The Companys operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped the Company continue its long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $955.8 million, $1.068 billion and $793.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Companys accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional information relating to the continuing and discontinued operations of the Company, see Results of Operations. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $413.3 million, $464.6 million and $2.623 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions was $86.2 million in 2003 (primarily due to the acquisitions of fiber transport assets and the acquisition of an additional 24.3% interest in a telephone company in which the Company owns a majority interest) and $2.245 billion in 2002 (substantially all of which relates to the 2002 Verizon acquisitions). Proceeds from the sales of assets were $4.1 million in 2002 (excluding the Companys 2002 wireless divestiture). Capital expenditures from continuing operations during 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $385.3 million, $377.9 million and $386.3 million, respectively. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company entered into a three year agreement with EchoStar Communications Corporation ("EchoStar") to provide co branded satellite television services to the Companys customers. As part of the transaction, the Company paid $25.0 million to EchoStar (see Note 4 for additional information). Financing activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations was ($578.5) million in 2004, ($403.8) million in 2003 and $506.3 million in 2002. Payments of debt were $179.4 million in 2004 and $432.3 million in 2003. Proceeds from the issuance of debt, net of debt payments, were $531.4 million during 2002. The Company repurchased 13.4 million shares of common stock for $401.0 million in 2004 to complete its stock repurchase program approved in February 2004. On May 6, 2002, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering $500 million of equity units. Net proceeds to the Company from this issuance were approximately $483.4 million. Each of the 20 million equity units issued was priced at $25 and consisted initially of a beneficial interest in a CenturyTel senior unsecured note with a principal amount of $25 and a contract to purchase shares of CenturyTel common stock no later than May 2005. As discussed below, the senior notes were remarketed in February 2005. Each stock purchase contract will generally require the holder to purchase between .6944 and .8741 of a share of CenturyTel common stock in May 2005 in exchange for $25, subject to certain adjustments and exceptions. The total distributions on the equity units were initially set at an initial annual rate of 6.875%, consisting of interest (6.02%) and contract adjustment payments (0.855%). In the third quarter of 2002, the Company issued $500 million of senior notes due 2012 (which bear interest at 7.875%) and $165 million of convertible senior debentures (which bear interest at 4.75% and which may be converted under certain specified circumstances into shares of CenturyTel common stock at a conversion price of $40.455 per share). Holders of the convertible senior debentures will have the right to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the debentures on August 1, 2006, August 1, 2010 and August 1, 2017 at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. On August 1, 2002, the Company sold substantially all of its wireless operations to Alltel and certain other purchasers for an aggregate of approximately $1.59 billion cash. The Company used proceeds from the sale of the above described equity units, senior notes and convertible senior debentures, along with the proceeds received from the sale of the Companys wireless operations and utilization of its $800 million credit facilities, to finance the third quarter 2002 acquisitions of telephone properties in Alabama and Missouri from Verizon which aggregated $2.201 billion, the redemption of $400 million principal amount in remarketable debt securities (plus an associated $71.1 million premium payment) in October 2002 and the Companys fourth quarter 2002 estimated tax payment, which aggregated $290 million and included the obligation to pay taxes associated with the sale of substantially all of its wireless operations. Other. Budgeted capital expenditures for 2005 total $400 million. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures in its telephone operations will continue to include the upgrading of its plant and equipment, including its digital switches, to provide enhanced services, particularly in its newly acquired markets, and the installation of fiber optic cable. On February 2, 2005, the Company signed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire metro fiber assets in 16 markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. ("KMC") for $65 million cash, subject to purchase price adjustments. The following table contains certain information concerning the Companys material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, except for the KMC purchase price obligation which is as of February 2, 2005. Payments due by period Contractual Less than After obligations Total 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 3,011,636 249,617 806,511(2) 306,557 1,648,951 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 1,935,814 185,807 347,029 304,936 1,098,042 KMC purchase price obligation $ 65,000 65,000 (1) For additional information on the terms of the Companys outstanding debt instruments, see footnote 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Includes $165 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys convertible debentures, Series K, due 2032, which can be put to the Company at various dates beginning in 2006 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Companys senior notes, Series J, due 2007. In February 2005, the Company purchased and retired approximately $400 million aggregate principal amount of its Series J notes in connection with a remarketing of the Series J notes. In February 2005, the Company remarketed approximately $460 million aggregate principal amount of its $500 million of outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at a rate of 4.628%. In connection with the remarketing, the Company purchased and retired approximately $400 million aggregate principal amount of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million aggregate principal amount of such notes remaining outstanding. Proceeds to purchase such notes came from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand. The Company expects to incur a pre tax charge of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring approximately $400 million of the Series J notes. For additional information, see Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. In early 2005, the Company filed preliminary consent solicitation materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission describing plans to solicit consents to amend the purchase contracts forming a part of the Companys equity units to grant the Company the flexibility to settle such purchase contracts in cash rather than in common stock (as described above). The Company is obligated to pay a consent fee to each consenting holder, the amount of which (should all holders consent) would aggregate $1.75 million. If under the consent solicitation the Company settled all of the purchase contracts in cash and the current stock price of the Companys common stock at the settlement date exceeds $36, the Company would be obligated to pay to the holders of the purchase contracts $13.9 million for every $1 that the stock price is in excess of $36. The Company cannot provide assurance that its consent solicitation will be initiated or be successful. In early February 2005, the Companys board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that will allow the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $200 million of either its common stock or convertible equity units prior to December 31, 2005. The Company commenced purchases under this plan in early March 2005. The Company continually evaluates the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expects to continue its long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractive communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, the Company may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. The Company generally does not announce its acquisitions or dispositions until it has entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. The Company may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of CenturyTel common stock and 200,000 shares of CenturyTel preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under CenturyTels acquisition shelf registration statement. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had available $533.0 million of undrawn committed bank lines of credit and the Companys telephone subsidiaries had available for use $123.0 million of commitments for long term financing from the Rural Utilities Service and Rural Telephone Bank. The Company has a commercial paper program that authorizes the Company to have outstanding up to $1.5 billion in commercial paper at any one time; however, borrowings are effectively limited to the amount available under its credit facility. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding under such program. The Company also has access to debt and equity capital markets, including its shelf registration statements. At December 31, 2004, the Company held over $167 million of cash and cash equivalents. In March 2005, the Company secured a new five year, $750 million revolving credit facility to replace its existing $533 million credit facility which expires in July 2005. Up to $150 million of the facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require the Company to meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.5 to 1. The interest rate on revolving loans under the facility is based on the Companys choice of several prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional margin that varies depending on the Companys credit ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility. The Company must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility, the amount of which varies based on the Companys credit ratings. Moodys Investors Service ("Moodys") rates CenturyTels long term debt Baa2 (with a stable outlook) and Standard & Poors ("S&P") rates CenturyTels long term debt BBB+ (with a stable outlook). Such ratings were affirmed in early 2005 in connection with the Series J remarketing and the Series M note issuance mentioned above. The Companys commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Any downgrade in the Companys credit ratings will increase its borrowing costs and commitment fees under its $750 million revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict the Companys access to the capital markets, accelerate the conversion rights of holders of the Companys outstanding convertible securities, increase the Companys borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the amount of the Companys debt covenants and decreasing the Companys financial or operating flexibility. The following table reflects the Companys debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31: 2004 2003 2002 Debt to total capitalization 46.9% 47.8 54.2 Ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends 3.57 3.33 2.33 REGULATION AND COMPETITION The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act"), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of the Companys telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. During 2003, the FCC released new rules outlining the obligations of incumbent LECs to lease to competitors elements of their circuit switched networks on an unbundled basis at prices that substantially limited the profitability of these arrangements to incumbent LECs. On March 2, 2004, a federal appellate court vacated significant portions of these rules, including the standards used to determine which unbundled network elements must be made available to competitors. In response to this court decision, on February 4, 2005, the FCC released rules (effective March 11, 2005) that require incumbent LECs to lease a network element only in those situations where competing carriers genuinely would be impaired without access to such network element, and where the unbundling would not interfere with the development of facilities based competition. These rules are further designed to remove unbundling obligations over time as competing carriers deploy their own networks and local exchange competition increases. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. Wireless services entities also increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LECs. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies. The FCC adopted an interim mechanism for a five year period, effective July 1, 2001, based on embedded, or historical, costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers, including substantially all of the Companys local exchange carriers. Based on recent FCC filings, the Company anticipates its 2005 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will be approximately $10 15 million lower than 2004 levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. Wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications carrier ("ETC") status in order to be eligible to receive USF support, which, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stresses on the USFs funding mechanism. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments the Company receives from the High Cost Loop support program. As a result of the continued increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor (caused by limited growth in the size of the High Cost Loop support program and changes in requests for support from the USF), the Company believes the aggregate level of payments it receives from the USF will continue to decline in the near term under the FCCs current rules. On August 16, 2004, the Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service released a notice requesting comments on the FCCs current rules for the provision of high cost support for rural companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as the Company. The FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring universal service support mechanisms, including opening a docket that will change the method of funding contributions. The FCC is expected to act before its current rules are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2006. Congress is also exploring various universal service issues ranging from targeted universal service legislation to re writing the 1996 Act. The Company has been and will continue to be active in monitoring these developments. Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several large cable television and telephone companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers route calls over the Internet, without use of ILECs circuit switches and, in certain cases, without use of ILECs networks to carry their communications traffic. VoIP providers use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate, all distance calling plans that may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services for several reasons, including lower network cost structures and the current ability of VoIP providers to use ILECs networks without paying access charges. However, the service must be purchased in addition to the cost of the broadband connection. In December 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking that is expected to address the effect of VoIP on intercarrier compensation, universal service and emergency services. On March 10, 2004, the FCC released a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the appropriate regulatory treatment of VoIP service and related issues. Although the FCCs rulemaking regarding VoIP enabled services remains pending, the FCC has adopted orders establishing broad guidelines for the regulation of such services, including an April 2004 order in which the FCC ruled that the IP telephony service of AT&T, which converts voice calls to IP format for routing over the public switched telephone network, is a regulated telecommunications service subject to interstate access charges. In addition, in November 2004, the FCC ruled that Internet based services provided by Vonage Holdings Corporation should be subject to federal rather than state jurisdiction. Several state commissions have filed appeals of this decision to various federal appellate courts. Also pending at the FCC is a petition filed by Level 3 Communications, Inc. asking the FCC to forbear from imposing interstate or intrastate access charges on Internet based calls that originate or terminate on the public switched telephone network. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for the Companys customers. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and on February 10, 2005 solicited comments on all proposals previously submitted to it. The Company is involved in this proceeding and will continue to monitor the implications of these plans to its operations. Recent events affecting the Company. During the last few years, several states in which the Company has substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in the Companys service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. State alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of the Companys LECs have also affected revenue growth recently. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that the Company reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its LECs. In addition, the Company has recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless and electronic mail services. In 2004 the Company incurred a reduction in its intrastate revenues of approximately $25.9 million compared to 2003 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 was $6.8 million. The Company believes such trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2005, although the magnitude of such decrease cannot be precisely estimated. In January 2003, the Louisiana Public Service Commission staff began reviewing the feasibility of converting the $42 million Louisiana Local Optional Service Fund ("LOS Fund") into a state universal service fund. Currently, the LOS Fund is funded primarily by BellSouth, which proposes to expand the base of contributors into the LOS Fund. The Company currently receives approximately $21 million from the LOS Fund each year. Although the Commission staff has recommended to transfer the funds $42 million to a state universal service fund, there can be no assurance that the Commission will adopt this recommendation or that funding will remain at current levels. Competition to provide traditional LEC services has thus far affected large urban areas to a greater extent than rural, suburban and small urban areas such as those in which the Companys telephone operations are located. While the Company expects its operating revenues in 2005 to continue to experience downward pressure due to continued access line losses and reduced network access revenues, the Company expects its consolidated revenues to increase in 2005 primarily due to increased demand for its long distance, fiber transport, DSL and other nonregulated product offerings (including its new video and wireless initiatives). Other matters. The Companys regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" ("SFAS 71"). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. The Company is monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to its regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in the Companys telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71" ("SFAS 101"), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. Depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for the Companys telephone operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires the Company to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, the Company did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for its telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. The Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2004 included regulatory assets of approximately $3.0 million (primarily deferred costs related to financing costs and regulatory proceedings) and regulatory liabilities of approximately $200.3 million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above). Net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $75.2 million. When and if the Companys regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, the Company does not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of its regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, the Company would be required to revise the lives of its property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company does not expect such revisions in asset lives will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of the Companys telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. The Company has certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2004 have not been material, and the Company currently has no reason to believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
