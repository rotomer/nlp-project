Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW CenturyTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing local exchange, long distance, Internet access and broadband services to customers in 26 states. We currently derive our revenues from providing (i) local exchange telephone services, (ii) network access services, (iii) long distance services, (iv) data services, which includes both digital subscriber line (DSL) and dial up Internet services, as well as special access and private line services, (v) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and (vi) other related services. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services. Effective in the first quarter of 2004, as a result of our increased focus on integrated bundle offerings and the varied discount structures associated with such offerings, we determined that our results of operations would be more appropriately reported as a single reportable segment under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Therefore, the results of operations for 2005 and 2004 reflect the presentation of a single reportable segment. Results of operations for 2003 have been conformed to this presentation of a single reportable segment. During 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for approximately $75.5 million cash. During 2003, we also acquired fiber transport assets in five central U.S. states (which we operate under the name LightCore) for $55.2 million cash. Our results of operations in 2005 were adversely impacted as a result of (i) lower Universal Service Fund and intrastate access revenues, (ii) declines in access lines, (iii) incremental amortization and operating expenses related to our billing and customer care system and (iv) expenses associated with expanding our new satellite video and wireless service offerings. See below for additional information. Our net income for 2005 was $334.5 million, compared to $337.2 million during 2004 and $344.7 million during 2003. Diluted earnings per share for 2005 was $2.49 compared to $2.41 in 2004 and $2.35 in 2003. The increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to lower average shares outstanding in 2005 compared to 2004 due to share repurchases that have occurred during the past two years. The diluted earnings per share calculation reflects the application of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04 8 to all periods presented. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 736,403 753,953 750,396 Interest expense (201,801 ) (211,051 ) (226,751 ) Income from unconsolidated cellular entity 4,910 7,067 6,160 Other income (expense) (1,742 ) (2,597 ) 2,154 Income tax expense (203,291 ) (210,128 ) (187,252 ) Net income $ 334,479 337,244 344,707 Basic earnings per share $ 2.55 2.45 2.40 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.49 2.41 2.35 Average basic shares outstanding 130,841 137,215 143,583 Average diluted shares outstanding 136,087 142,144 148,779 Operating income decreased $17.6 million in 2005 as a $71.9 million increase in operating revenues was more than offset by an $89.4 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income increased $3.6 million in 2004 as a $39.8 million increase in operating revenues was substantially offset by a $36.2 million increase in operating expenses. In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; our ability to effectively manage our growth, including integrating newly acquired businesses into our operations and hiring adequate numbers of qualified staff; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward looking statements for any reason. OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Local service $ 702,400 716,028 712,565 Network access 959,838 966,011 1,001,462 Long distance 189,872 186,997 173,884 Data 318,770 275,777 244,998 Fiber transport and CLEC 115,454 74,409 43,041 Other 192,918 188,150 191,660 Operating revenues $ 2,479,252 2,407,372 2,367,610 Local service revenues. We derive local service revenues by providing local exchange telephone services in our service areas. The $13.6 million (1.9%) decrease in local service revenues in 2005 is primarily due to (i) a $16.1 million decrease due a 3.3% decline in the average number of access lines served and (ii) a $7.5 million decline as a result of a decrease in minutes of use in extended area calling plans in certain areas. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) an $8.7 million increase due to our providing custom calling features to more customers and (ii) a $4.2 million increase due to the mandated implementation of extended area calling plans in certain areas. Of the $3.5 million (.5%) increase in local service revenues in 2004, $12.6 million was due to the provision of custom calling features to more customers, which was partially offset by an $8.4 million decrease due to a 2.2% decline in the average number of access lines served. Access lines declined 99,500 (4.3%) during 2005 compared to a decline of 62,500 (2.6%) in 2004. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services. Based on current conditions, we expect access lines to decline between 4.5% and 5.5% during 2006. Network access revenues. We derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice and data transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms. Certain of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers (LECs) administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues decreased $6.2 million (0.6%) in 2005 and decreased $35.5 million (3.5%) in 2004 due to the following factors: 2005 2004 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Recovery from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program $ (13,065 ) (11,311 ) Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use and decreased access rates in certain states, net of increased recovery from state support funds (13,392 ) (26,798 ) Partial recovery of increased operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return on rate base 6,819 3,980 Rate changes in certain jurisdictions (3,457 ) 5,052 Revision of prior year revenue settlement agreements 15,947 (3,690 ) Other, net 975 (2,684 ) $ (6,173 ) (35,451 ) As indicated in the chart above, in 2005 we experienced a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $13.4 million primarily due to (i) a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services) and (ii) the mandated implementation of extended area calling plans in certain areas. The corresponding decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was $26.8 million. We believe intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2006, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. Prior year revenue settlement agreements for 2005 included the recognition of approximately $35.9 million of revenue (of which $24.5 million was reflected in network access revenues and $11.4 million was reflected in data revenues) as the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005. See Critical Accounting Policies below and Note 17 for additional information. We do not expect to recognize this level of revenue related to prior year revenue settlement agreements in 2006. We anticipate our 2006 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program will be approximately $8 12 million lower than 2005 levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all recipients. Long distance revenues. We derive our long distance revenues by providing retail long distance services to our customers. Long distance revenues increased $2.9 million (1.5%) and $13.1 million (7.5%) in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $2.9 million increase in 2005 was primarily attributable to a 12.0% increase in the average number of long distance lines served and a 12.8% increase in minutes of use (aggregating $21.2 million), substantially offset by a decrease in the average rate we charged our customers ($16.5 million). The $13.1 million increase in 2004 was primarily attributable to a 14.9% increase in the average number of long distance lines served and a 15.3% increase in minutes of use (aggregating $21.7 million), partially offset by a decrease in the average rate we charged our customers ($9.2 million). We anticipate that increased competition and our current level of customer penetration will continue to place downward pressure on rates and slow the growth rate of the number of long distance lines served. Data revenues. We derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services (both DSL and dial up services) and data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues increased $43.0 million (15.6%) in 2005 and $30.8 million (12.6%) in 2004. The $43.0 million increase in 2005 was primarily due to (i) a $24.8 million increase in Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of DSL customers, partially offset by a decrease in the number of dial up customers, (ii) a $10.8 million increase in special access revenues due to an increase in the number of special circuits provided and an increase in the partial recovery of our increased operating expenses through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, and (iii) an $8.6 million increase in revenues related to prior year settlement agreements (the majority of which related to the revenue recorded in 2005 as the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005). We do not expect to recognize this level of revenue related to prior year revenue settlement agreements in 2006. The $30.8 million increase in 2004 was primarily due to (i) a $20.3 million increase in Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of DSL customers and (ii) an $11.3 million increase in special access revenues due to an increase in the number of special circuits provided and an increase in the partial recovery of our increased operating expenses through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies. Fiber transport and CLEC. Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring businesses. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $41.0 million (55.2%) in 2005, of which $27.7 million was due to revenue from the June 30, 2005 acquisition of fiber assets from KMC and $12.4 million was attributable to growth in the number of customers in our incumbent fiber transport business. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $31.4 million (72.9%) in 2004, substantially all of which is attributable to our acquisitions of fiber transport assets (which are operated under the name LightCore) in June and December 2003. Other revenues. We derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii) providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating in the publication of local directories and (iv) offering our new video and wireless services. Other revenues increased $4.8 million (2.5%) during 2005 primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in directory revenues. Other revenues decreased $3.5 million (1.8%) during 2004 primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in directory revenues due to the expiration of our rights to share in the revenues of yellow page directories published in certain markets acquired from Verizon in 2002. OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 821,929 755,413 739,210 Selling, general and administrative 388,989 397,102 374,352 Depreciation and amortization 531,931 500,904 503,652 Operating expenses $ 1,742,849 1,653,419 1,617,214 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $66.5 million (8.8%) in 2005 primarily due to (i) a $21.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired from KMC in June 2005; (ii) a $16.4 million increase in expenses associated with our Internet operations primarily due to an increase in the number of DSL customers; (iii) a $10.6 million increase in costs associated with growth in our fiber transport business; (iv) a $9.0 million increase in salaries and benefits; (v) an $8.2 million increase in access expenses; (vi) a $5.3 million increase due to start up costs associated with our new satellite video and wireless reseller services; and (vii) a $4.3 million increase in costs associated with growth in our long distance business. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $3.9 million decrease in expenses caused by us settling certain pole attachment disputes in 2005 for amounts less than those previously accrued and (ii) a $3.4 million decrease in customer service expense. Cost of services and products increased $16.2 million (2.2%) in 2004 primarily due to (i) a $14.6 million increase in expenses associated with operating our fiber transport assets acquired in June and December 2003; (ii) an $8.5 million increase in expenses associated with our Internet operations due to an increase in the number of customers; (iii) a $7.8 million increase in customer service and retention related expenses; and (iv) a $6.0 million increase in plant operations expenses. Such increases were partially offset by a $13.8 million decrease in access expenses (which included a one time credit of $3.1 million recorded in 2004) and a $9.2 million decrease in the cost of providing retail long distance service primarily due to a decrease in the average cost per minute of use and a decrease in circuit costs. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.1 million (2.0%) in 2005 primarily due to (i) a $12.4 million decrease in operating taxes (primarily due to an $8.6 million one time charge in the third quarter of 2004); (ii) an $11.2 million reduction in bad debt expense, and (iii) a $4.6 million decrease in expenses attributable to our Sarbanes Oxley internal controls compliance effort. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) $7.9 million of expenses incurred by the properties acquired from KMC; (ii) a $5.9 million increase in customer service and marketing costs associated with growth in our Internet business and (iii) a $2.8 million increase in sales and marketing costs associated with our new satellite video and wireless reseller services. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.8 million (6.1%) in 2004 due to (i) a $9.0 million increase in marketing expenses; (ii) a $6.4 million increase in expenses attributable to our Sarbanes Oxley internal controls compliance effort; (iii) a nonrecurring $5.0 million reduction in bad debt expense recorded in the first quarter of 2003 due to the partial recovery of amounts previously written off related to the bankruptcy of MCI (formerly WorldCom); and (iv) a $4.3 million increase in expenses associated with operating our LightCore assets acquired in 2003. Such increases were partially offset by a $6.6 million decrease in bad debt expense (exclusive of the MCI recovery mentioned above). Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $31.0 million (6.2%) in 2005. The year 2004 included a one time reduction in depreciation expense of $13.2 million to adjust the balances of certain over depreciated property, plant and equipment accounts. The remaining $17.8 million increase in 2005 is primarily due to (i) a $19.0 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service, (ii) a $6.1 million increase associated with amortization of our new billing system and (iii) a $2.8 million increase due to depreciation and amortization incurred by the properties acquired from KMC. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $7.8 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and (ii) the non recurrence in 2005 of a $3.1 million one time increase recorded in 2004 related to the depreciation of fixed assets associated with our new billing system. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.7 million (.5%) in 2004. In addition to the $13.2 million reduction in depreciation expense mentioned above, depreciation expense for 2004 was also reduced by $8.4 million due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by a $16.7 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service, the above mentioned $3.1 million one time increase in 2004 related to depreciation of fixed assets related to our new billing system, and a $3.0 million increase in depreciation due to the assets acquired in connection with our LightCore operations. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $9.3 million (4.4%) in 2005 compared to 2004 as a $16.1 million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding was partially offset by a $7.7 million increase due to higher average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $15.7 million (6.9%) in 2004 compared to 2003 partially due to $7.5 million of nonrecurring interest expense in 2003 associated with various operating tax audits. The remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average debt outstanding. INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED CELLULAR ENTITY Income from unconsolidated cellular entity was $4.9 million in 2005, $7.1 million in 2004 and $6.2 million in 2003. Such income represents our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to our core operations, including interest income and allowance for funds used during construction. Other income (expense) was $(1.7 million) in 2005, $(2.6 million) in 2004 and $2.2 million in 2003. The years 2005 and 2004 were impacted by certain charges and credits that are not expected to occur in the future. Included in 2005 was (i) a $16.2 million pre tax charge due to the impairment of a non operating investment and (ii) a $4.8 million debt extinguishment expense related to purchasing and retiring approximately $400 million of Senior J notes. The year 2005 was favorably impacted by (i) $3.2 million of non recurring interest income related to the settlement of various income tax audits; (ii) a $3.5 million gain from the sale of a non operating investment and (iii) $3.9 million of higher interest income due to higher average cash balances. Included in 2004 was a $3.6 million prepayment expense paid in connection with the redemption of $100 million aggregate principal amount of our Series B senior notes in May 2004 and a $2.5 million charge related to the impairment of a non operating investment. INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective income tax rate was 37.8%, 38.4% and 35.2% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income tax expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards. This increase was primarily due to changes in state income tax laws and other factors which impacted the projections of future taxable income. This tax expense increase was more than offset by (i) a reduction of state income tax reserves ($11.6 million, net of federal income tax benefit); (ii) a reduction in our composite state income tax rate due to income being apportioned to states with lower state tax rates ($8.5 million); and (iii) the favorable settlement of various federal income tax audits ($1.3 million). ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Over the last several years, we have elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, as allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services, focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for the issuance of stock options. SFAS 123(R) requires us to measure the cost of the employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date. Such cost will be recognized as an expense over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. SFAS 123(R) is effective for all awards granted after its effective date of January 1, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 123(R), compensation cost is also recognized over the applicable remaining vesting period for any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date. In order to eliminate the recognition of compensation expense related to outstanding awards that are not fully vested as of January 1, 2006, on December 14, 2005, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved accelerating the vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding (which totaled approximately 1.5 million options), effective December 31, 2005. As a result of accelerating the vesting of these options, we will avoid approximately $4.9 million of pre tax compensation expense, of which approximately $4.1 million would have been recognized in 2006. We recognized approximately $156,000 of expense in the fourth quarter of 2005 as a result of accelerating the vesting of these options. We expect the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to decrease our diluted earnings per share by approximately $.02 to $.03 in 2006. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although we generally have no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. For our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject to SFAS 71) and our other non regulated operations, we have not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. On March 31, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS 143. FIN 47, which was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, clarifies that the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS 143 apply to asset retirement obligations in which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity. We identified conditional asset retirement obligations for (i) asbestos removal in buildings, (ii) removal of underground storage tanks, (iii) our property located on public and private rights of way and (iv) our property that is attached to poles owned by other utilities and municipalities. Due to a lack of historical experience from which to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, we concluded that an asset retirement obligation associated with our property located on rights of way is indeterminate. We also concluded that our conditional asset retirement obligations related to the removal of asbestos, underground storage tanks and our property that is attached to other entities poles was immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations and therefore has not been recognized. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force No. 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share (EITF 04 8). EITF 04 8 requires securities issuable under contingently convertible instruments be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. Our $165 million Series K senior notes are convertible into common stock under various contingent circumstances, including the common stock attaining a specified trading price in excess of the notes fixed conversion price. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2004, our diluted earnings per share and diluted shares outstanding reflect the application of EITF 04 8. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this change in accounting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) long lived assets and (v) income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that certain critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity, including those described below. Revenue recognition. Certain of our interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. In the second quarter of 2004, we revised certain estimates for recognizing interstate revenues. Previously, we initially recognized interstate revenues at a rate of return lower than the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC to allow for potential decreases in demand or other factor changes which could decrease the achieved rate of return over the respective monitoring periods. As the monitoring periods progressed, we recorded additional revenues ratably up to the achieved rate of return. In the second quarter of 2004, we began generally recognizing such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless the actual achieved rate of return was lower than authorized. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate tariffs directly with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since July 2004, we have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe such tariffs are deemed lawful. There is no assurance that our future tariff filings will be deemed lawful. For those tariffs that have not yet been deemed lawful, we initially recorded as a liability our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return, and may thereafter recognize as revenue some or all of these amounts at the end of the applicable settlement period or as our legal entitlement thereto becomes more certain. We recorded approximately $35.9 million as revenue in the third quarter of 2005 as the settlement period related to the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005. The amount of our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 for the 2003/2004 monitoring period aggregated approximately $31.5 million. The settlement period related to the 2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2007. We will continue to monitor the legal status of any proceedings that could impact our entitlement to these funds. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pension and postretirement benefits. The amounts recognized in our financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2005 and 2004, we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe reflects the expected long term rates of return in the financial markets. Another assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. Our discount rate at December 31, 2005 was 5.5% compared to 5.75% at December 31, 2004, which we believe is the appropriate rate at which the pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled. Such rates were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of our expected cash outflows of our benefit plans. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual pension expense approximately $1.8 million and increase annual postretirement expense approximately $900,000. Intangible and long lived assets. We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. We completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2005) under SFAS 142 and determined our goodwill is not impaired as of such date. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. Income taxes. We estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain income tax contingency reserves for potential assessments from the various taxing authorities. These reserves are estimated based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances. Changes to the tax contingency reserves could materially affect operating results in the period of change. For additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters below, and the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. INFLATION Historically, we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time certain costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. However, LECs operating over 60% of our total access lines are now governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict or delay our ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes may further alter our ability to recover increased costs in our regulated operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes are limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. As operating expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover the costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be $2.6 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long term debt of 6.7% and an overall weighted maturity of 9 years compared to terms and rates available on such date in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 67 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $98.2 million decrease in the fair value of our long term debt. As of December 31, 2005, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 81% of our long term debt obligations were fixed rate. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We periodically review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implement strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are fixed to variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.229% to the six month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August 2012. At December 31, 2005, we realized a rate under these hedges of 8.25% and for 2005 we realized an average interest rate of 7.80%. Interest expense was reduced by $386,000 during 2005 as a result of these hedges. The aggregate fair market value of these hedges was $17.6 million at December 31, 2005 and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in our underlying long term debt on the December 31, 2005 balance sheet. With respect to these hedges, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $32.4 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges and would also increase our interest expense. As of December 31, 2004, we also had outstanding cash flow hedges that effectively locked in the interest rate on a majority of certain anticipated debt transactions that ultimately were completed in February 2005. We locked in the interest rate on (i) $100 million of 2.25 year debt (remarketed in February 2005) at 3.9%; (ii) $75 million of 10 year debt (issued in February 2005) at 5.4%; and (iii) $225 million of 10 year debt (issued in February 2005) at 5.5%. In February 2005, upon settlement of such hedges, we (i) received $366,000 related to the 2.25 year debt remarketing which is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the debt and (ii) paid $7.7 million related to the 10 year debt issuance which is being amortized as an increase in interest expense over the 10 year term of the debt. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide for our cash needs. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $964.7 million, $955.8 million and $1.068 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $481.4 million, $413.3 million and $464.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used for acquisitions was $75.5 million in 2005 (due to the acquisition of fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc.) and $86.2 million in 2003 (primarily due to the acquisitions of fiber transport assets and the acquisition of an additional 24.3% interest in a telephone company in which we now own a 100% interest). Capital expenditures during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $414.9 million, $385.3 million and $377.9 million, respectively. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $491.7 million in 2005, $578.5 million in 2004 and $403.8 million in 2003. Payments of debt were $693.3 million in 2005 and $179.4 million in 2004. In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million) and 13.4 million shares (for $401.0 million) in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 repurchases include 12.9 million shares repurchased (for a total price of $437.5 million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements (see below and Note 8 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information). In February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at an interest rate of 4.628%. We received no proceeds in connection with the remarketing as all proceeds were held in trust to secure the obligation of our equity unit holders to purchase common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired approximately $400 million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million remaining outstanding. We incurred a pre tax charge of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring the notes. Proceeds to purchase such notes came from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand. On May 16, 2005, upon settlement of 15.9 million of our outstanding equity units, we received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued approximately 12.9 million common shares. In late May 2005, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired 12.9 million shares of common stock for an initial aggregate price of $416.5 million, the proceeds of which came from the settlement of the equity units mentioned above and cash on hand. Under these agreements, the investment banks repurchased CenturyTel shares in the open market through December 2005. At the end of the repurchase period, we paid the investment banks a price adjustment in cash of approximately $21.0 million based principally upon the actual cost of the shares repurchased by the investment banks. Other. For 2006, we have budgeted $325 million for capital expenditures. We have invested significant amounts in our wireline network in the last several years and believe we are in a position to move closer to maintenance capital expenditure levels for the foreseeable future for our wireline operations. Our capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and expanding our data networks. As relief from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, certain of our affected subsidiaries were granted a deferral from making their remaining 2005 estimated federal tax payments until 2006. Accordingly, we made a payment of approximately $75 million in the first quarter of 2006 to satisfy our remaining 2005 estimated payments. We expect to receive approximately $120 million of cash on a pre tax basis in the first half of 2006 from the redemption of our Rural Telephone Bank stock. On February 21, 2006, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock and terminated the approximately $13 million remaining balance of our existing $200 million share repurchase program approved in February 2005. We repurchased the first $500 million of common stock through accelerated share repurchase agreements entered into with various investment banks, repurchasing and retiring approximately 14.36 million shares of common stock at an average initial price of $34.83 per share. We funded these agreements principally through borrowings under our $750 million credit facility and cash on hand. We expect to use cash generated from operations during 2006 to repay these borrowings. The investment banks are expected to repurchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market in the coming months. Once these repurchases are complete, we will receive or be required to pay a price adjustment (payable at our discretion in either shares or cash) based principally on the actual cost of the shares repurchased by the investment banks. The following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005. Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 After 2010 (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 2,652,806 276,736 (2 ) 401,749 529,846 1,444,475 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 1,730,951 178,234 320,879 289,855 941,983 (1) For additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Includes $165 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures, Series K, due 2032, which can be put to us at various dates beginning in 2006. We continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expect to continue our long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractively priced communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf registration statement. During 2005, we secured a new five year, $750 million revolving credit facility. Up to $150 million of the facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.5 to 1. The interest rate on revolving loans under the facility is based on our choice of several prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional margin that varies depending on our credit ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility, the amount of which varies based on our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2005, we had no amounts outstanding under our new credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, our telephone subsidiaries also had available for use $115.9 million of commitments for long term financing from the Rural Utilities Service. We have a commercial paper program that authorizes us to have outstanding up to $1.5 billion in commercial paper at any one time; however, borrowings are effectively limited to the amount available under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2005, we had no commercial paper outstanding under such program. We also have access to debt and equity capital markets, including our shelf registration statements. At December 31, 2005, we held over $158.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) rates our long term debt Baa2 (with a stable outlook) and Standard & Poors (S&P) rates our long term debt BBB+ (subject to being on CreditWatch with negative implications). Moodys affirmed its rating in early 2006 in connection with the announcement of our $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. In January 2006, S&P placed our debt rating on CreditWatch with negative implications, citing the continued loss of access lines in the wireline industry as a whole. Our commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A2 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $750 million revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to the capital markets, accelerate the conversion rights of holders of our outstanding convertible securities, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing our financial or operating flexibility. The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 2003 Debt to total capitalization 42.3 % 46.9 47.8 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.60 3.57 3.33 * For purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend costs. REGULATION AND COMPETITION The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services. As a result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new services. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five year period, which ends June 30, 2006, based on embedded, or historical, costs that will provide predictable levels of support to rural local exchange carriers, including substantially all of our LECs. Wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) status in order to be eligible to receive USF support, which, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stresses on the USFs funding mechanism. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments we receive from the High Cost Loop support program. As a result of the continued increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients (caused by a decrease in the size of the High Cost Loop support program and changes in requests for support from the USF), we believe the aggregate level of payments we receive from the USF will continue to decline in the near term under the FCCs current rules. Based on recent FCC filings, we anticipate our 2006 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will be approximately $8 12 million lower than 2005 levels due to increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor. On August 16, 2004, the FSJB released a notice requesting comments on the FCCs current rules for the provision of high cost support for rural companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us. In addition, the FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring universal service support mechanisms and various parties have judicially challenged several aspects of the FCCs universal service rules, all of which has created additional uncertainty regarding the USFs programs, including opening a docket that will change the method of funding contributions. The FCC is expected to issue soon an order addressing a new type of contribution methodology. In the event that does not happen, we believe, but cannot assure you, that the FCC will likely extend the interim mechanism now in place before it lapses on June 30, 2006. Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recently several large electric utilities have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs. Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate, all distance calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs and may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services. Beginning in late 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted orders establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and in early 2005 solicited comments on all proposals previously submitted to it. Industry negotiations are continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry segments. Until this proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact this proceeding will have on our results of operations. Many cable, entertainment, technology or other communication companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Recent events affecting us. During the last few years, several states in which we have substantial operations took legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. State alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of our LECs have also affected revenue growth recently. These alternative regulation plans now govern over 60% of our access lines. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that we reduce intrastate access tariffed rates for certain of its LECs. In addition, we have recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services. In 2005 we incurred a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $13.4 million compared to 2004 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was $26.8 million. We believe this trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2006, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. While we expect our operating revenues in 2006 to continue to experience downward pressure primarily due to continued access line losses and reduced network access revenues, we expect such declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand for our fiber transport, DSL and other nonregulated product offerings (including our new video and wireless initiatives). For a more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual report. Other matters. Our regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71 (SFAS 101), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. Depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 included regulatory assets of approximately $3.1 million (primarily deferred costs related to financing costs and regulatory proceedings) and regulatory liabilities of approximately $183.2 million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above). Net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $68.3 million. When and if our regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, we currently do not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we would be required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. We currently do not expect such revisions in asset lives will have a material impact on our results of operations. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. We have certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2005 have not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
