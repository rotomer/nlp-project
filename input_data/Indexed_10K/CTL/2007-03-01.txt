Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW CenturyTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services, including local and long distance voice, Internet access and broadband services, to customers in 25 states. We currently derive our revenues from providing (i) local exchange and long distance voice services, (ii) network access services, (iii) data services, which includes both high speed (DSL) and dial up Internet services, as well as special access and private line services, (iv) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and (v) other related services. Our results of operations in 2006 were adversely impacted as a result of (i) lower Universal Service Fund and intrastate access revenues, (ii) declines in access lines, (iii) the recognition of stock option expense in accordance with SFAS 123(R) and (iv) expenses associated with expanding our new video and wireless service offerings. See below for additional information. On June 30, 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for approximately $75.5 million cash. On March 1 and August 31, 2006, we announced workforce reductions involving an aggregate of approximately 400 jobs and, in connection therewith, incurred a net pre tax charge of approximately $7.5 million (consisting of a $9.4 million charge to operating expenses, net of a $1.9 million favorable revenue impact related to such expenses) for severance and related costs. See Note 8 for additional information. In the second quarter of 2006, we (i) recorded a one time pre tax gain of approximately $117.8 million upon redemption of our investment in the stock of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) and (ii) sold our local exchange operations in Arizona. See Note 15 for additional information. Our net income for 2006 was $370.0 million, compared to $334.5 million during 2005 and $337.2 million during 2004. Diluted earnings per share for 2006 was $3.07 compared to $2.49 in 2005 and $2.41 in 2004. The increase in diluted earnings per share is primarily attributable to lower average shares outstanding in 2006 compared to prior years due to share repurchases that have occurred during the past two years and to the gain recorded upon redemption of our investment in RTB stock. 45 Table of Contents Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 665,538 736,403 753,953 Interest expense (195,957 ) (201,801 ) (211,051 ) Other income (expense) 121,568 3,168 4,470 Income tax expense (221,122 ) (203,291 ) (210,128 ) Net income $ 370,027 334,479 337,244 Basic earnings per share $ 3.17 2.55 2.45 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.07 2.49 2.41 Average basic shares outstanding 116,671 130,841 137,215 Average diluted shares outstanding 122,229 136,087 142,144 Operating income decreased $70.9 million in 2006 due to a $31.5 million decrease in operating revenues and a $39.3 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income decreased $17.6 million in 2005 as a $71.9 million increase in operating revenues was more than offset by an $89.4 million increase in operating expenses. In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; our ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities, including successfully financing, consummating and integrating pending acquisitions and retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward looking statements for any reason. 46 Table of Contents All references to Notes in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Voice $ 860,741 892,272 903,025 Network access 878,702 959,838 966,011 Data 351,495 318,770 275,777 Fiber transport and CLEC 149,088 115,454 74,409 Other 207,704 192,918 188,150 Operating revenues $ 2,447,730 2,479,252 2,407,372 As a result of increased bundling of our local exchange and long distance service offerings, beginning in 2006, we have combined the revenues of such offerings into a category entitled Voice. We have restated prior periods to insure comparability. Voice revenues. We derive voice revenues by providing local exchange telephone services and retail long distance services to customers in our service areas. The $31.5 million (3.5%) decrease in voice revenues in 2006 is primarily due to (i) a $22.3 million decrease due a 4.8% decline in the number of access lines served and (ii) a $26.1 million decline as a result of a decrease in minutes of use in extended area calling plans in certain areas. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) a $12.6 million increase in long distance revenues primarily attributable to an increase in the number of long distance lines and increased long distance minutes of use, both of which were partially offset by a decline in the average rate we charged our long distance customers and (ii) a $9.9 million increase due to providing custom calling features to more customers. The $10.8 million (1.2%) decrease in voice revenues in 2005 is primarily due to (i) a $16.5 million decrease due to a decrease in the average rate we charged our long distance customers, (ii) a $16.1 million decrease due a 3.3% decline in the average number of access lines served, and (iii) a $7.5 million decline as a result of a decrease in minutes of use in extended area calling plans in certain areas. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) a $21.2 million increase in long distance revenues attributable to a 12.0% increase in the average number of long distance lines served and a 12.8% increase in minutes of use and (ii) an $8.7 million increase due to providing custom calling features to more customers. Excluding (i) the sale of our Arizona telephone operations in May 2006 and (ii) the net impact of removing test lines from our access line counts and adding lines as a result of converting and correcting our databases during 2006, access lines declined 107,000 (4.8%) during 2006 compared to a decline of 99,500 (4.3%) in 2005. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during the past few years is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services. We expect access lines to decline between 4.5% and 6.0% during 2007. 47 Table of Contents Network access revenues. We derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice and data transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms. Certain of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the remainder of such revenues (except for DSL related revenues) are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers (LECs) administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues decreased $81.1 million (8.5%) in 2006 and decreased $6.2 million (0.6%) in 2005 due to the following factors: 2006 2005 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Recovery from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program $ (11,637 ) (13,065 ) Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use, decreased access rates in certain states and recovery from state support funds (16,326 ) (13,392 ) Partial recovery of operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return on rate base (16,825 ) 6,819 Rate changes in certain jurisdictions (2,875 ) (3,457 ) Prior year revenue settlement agreements (31,219 ) 15,947 Other, net (2,254 ) 975 $ (81,136 ) (6,173 ) Our revenues from the Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund decreased approximately $11.6 million in 2006 and $13.1 million in 2005, primarily due to an increase in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. We anticipate our 2007 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program will be approximately the same as 2006 levels. In 2006, we experienced a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $16.3 million primarily due to a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services). The corresponding decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 was $13.4 million. We believe intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2007, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. 48 Table of Contents Prior year revenue settlement agreements for 2005 included the recognition of approximately $35.9 million of revenue settlements for prior periods that did not recur in 2006. Of the $35.9 million recognized, $24.5 million was reflected in network access revenues and $11.4 million was reflected in data revenues. Data revenues. We derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services (both DSL and dial up services) and data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues increased $32.7 million (10.3%) in 2006 and $43.0 million (15.6%) in 2005. The 2006 increase was substantially due to a $54.0 million increase in DSL related revenues primarily due to growth in the number of high speed Internet customers. Such increase was partially offset by a decrease in prior year revenue settlements due to the above described recognition of approximately $11.4 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2005 and a $4.9 million decrease due to a reduced number of dial up Internet customers. The $43.0 million increase in 2005 was primarily due to (i) a $24.8 million increase in Internet revenues due primarily to growth in the number of high speed Internet customers, partially offset by a decrease in the number of dial up customers, (ii) a $10.8 million increase in special access revenues due to an increase in the number of special circuits provided and an increase in the partial recovery of our increased operating expenses through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, and (iii) an $8.6 million net increase in revenues related to prior year settlement agreements driven principally by the above described non recurring increase in the third quarter of 2005. Fiber transport and CLEC. Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring businesses. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $33.6 million (29.1%) in 2006, of which $24.4 million was due to revenues from the fiber assets acquired on June 30, 2005 from KMC and $8.5 million was attributable to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $41.0 million (55.2%) in 2005, of which $27.7 million was due to revenue from the June 30, 2005 acquisition of fiber assets from KMC and $12.4 million was attributable to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business. Other revenues. We derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii) providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating in the publication of local directories and (iv) providing new service offerings, principally consisting of our new video and wireless reseller services. Other revenues increased $14.8 million (7.7%) during 2006 primarily due to a $12.1 million increase in revenues of our video and wireless reseller offerings and $2.5 million increase in directory revenues. Other revenues increased $4.8 million (2.5%) during 2005 primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in directory revenues. 49 Table of Contents OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 888,414 821,929 755,413 Selling, general and administrative 370,272 388,989 397,102 Depreciation and amortization 523,506 531,931 500,904 Operating expenses $ 1,782,192 1,742,849 1,653,419 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $66.5 million (8.1%) in 2006 primarily due to (i) an $18.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired from KMC; (ii) an $18.3 million increase in costs associated with growth in our long distance business; (iii) a $14.3 million increase in expenses associated with our video and wireless reseller service offerings; (iv) an $11.5 million increase in Internet operating expenses primarily due to growth in the number of high speed Internet customers; and (v) $8.6 million of severance and related costs associated with our workforce reduction (see Note 8). Cost of services and products increased $66.5 million (8.8%) in 2005 primarily due to (i) a $21.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired from KMC in June 2005; (ii) a $16.4 million increase in expenses associated with our Internet operations primarily due to an increase in the number of high speed Internet customers; (iii) a $10.6 million increase in costs associated with growth in our fiber transport business; (iv) a $9.0 million increase in salaries and benefits; (v) an $8.2 million increase in access expenses; (vi) a $5.3 million increase due to start up costs associated with our new video and wireless reseller services; and (vii) a $4.3 million increase in costs associated with growth in our long distance business. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $3.9 million decrease in expenses caused by us settling certain pole attachment disputes in 2005 for amounts less than those previously accrued and (ii) a $3.4 million decrease in customer service expense. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $18.7 million (4.8%) in 2006 primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in marketing expenses; a $10.6 million reduction in information technology expenses; an $8.7 million reduction in bad debt expense; and a $5.8 million decrease in operating taxes. These decreases were partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $5.5 million increase in expenses incurred from the properties acquired from KMC. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8.1 million (2.0%) in 2005 primarily due to (i) a $12.4 million decrease in operating taxes (primarily due to an $8.6 million one time charge in the third quarter of 2004); (ii) an $11.2 million reduction in bad debt expense, and (iii) a $4.6 million decrease in expenses attributable to our Sarbanes Oxley internal controls compliance effort. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) $7.9 million of expenses incurred by the properties acquired from KMC; (ii) a $5.9 million increase in customer service and marketing costs associated with growth in our Internet business and (iii) a $2.8 million increase in sales and marketing costs associated with our new video and wireless reseller services. 50 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $8.4 million (1.6%) in 2006, primarily due to a $25.3 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) a $16.6 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service and (ii) a $3.1 million increase due to depreciation and amortization of the properties acquired from KMC. Depreciation and amortization increased $31.0 million (6.2%) in 2005. The year 2004 included a one time reduction in depreciation expense of $13.2 million to adjust the balances of certain over depreciated property, plant and equipment accounts. The remaining $17.8 million increase in 2005 is primarily due to (i) a $19.0 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service, (ii) a $6.1 million increase associated with amortization of our new billing system and (iii) a $2.8 million increase due to depreciation and amortization incurred by the properties acquired from KMC. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $7.8 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and (ii) the non recurrence in 2005 of a $3.1 million one time increase recorded in 2004 related to the depreciation of fixed assets associated with our new billing system. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $5.8 million (2.9%) in 2006 compared to 2005 as a $10.5 million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding was partially offset by a $7.1 million increase due to higher average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $9.3 million (4.4%) in 2005 compared to 2004 as a $16.1 million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding was partially offset by a $7.7 million increase due to higher average interest rates. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to our core operations, including gains/losses from asset dispositions and impairments, our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during construction. Other income (expense) was $121.6 million in 2006, $3.2 million in 2005 and $4.5 million in 2004. The years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were impacted by certain charges and credits that are not expected to occur in the future. Included in 2006 were pre tax gains of approximately $118.6 million, substantially all of which related to the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB, which were partially offset by pre tax charges of approximately $11.7 million due to the impairment of certain non operating investments. Included in 2005 was (i) a $16.2 million pre tax charge due to the impairment of a non operating investment; (ii) a $4.8 million debt extinguishment expense related to purchasing and retiring approximately $400 million of our Senior J notes; (iii) $3.2 million of non recurring interest income related to the settlement of various income tax audits; and (iv) a $3.5 million gain from the sale of a non operating investment. Included in 2004 was a $3.6 million prepayment expense paid in connection with the redemption of $100 million aggregate principal amount of our Series B senior notes in May 2004 and a $2.5 million charge related to the impairment of a non operating investment. 51 Table of Contents INCOME TAX EXPENSE Our effective income tax rate was 37.4%, 37.8% and 38.4% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $6.4 million in 2006 due to the resolution of various income tax audit issues. Income tax expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards. This increase was primarily due to changes in state income tax laws and other factors which impacted the projections of future taxable income. This tax expense increase was more than offset by (i) a reduction of state income tax reserves ($11.6 million, net of federal income tax benefit); (ii) a reduction in our composite state income tax rate due to more income being apportioned to states with lower state tax rates ($8.5 million); and (iii) the favorable settlement of various federal income tax audits ($1.3 million). ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We do not expect the impact of adopting FIN 48 to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157. 52 Table of Contents In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 was effective for our December 31, 2006 balance sheet and requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss) and to stockholders equity, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 158, our non current assets decreased $64.7 million, our current liabilities decreased $898,000, our non current liabilities (excluding deferred income taxes) increased approximately $99.5 million, our deferred income taxes decreased approximately $65.4 million and our stockholders equity (reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss) decreased approximately $97.9 million. See Note 1 for additional information. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet approach and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of the relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Upon the implementation of SAB 108, we recognized a net $9.7 million increase to beginning of the year retained earnings for the cumulative effect of correcting prior year uncorrected misstatements. See Note 1 for additional information. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although we generally have no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. For our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject to SFAS 71) and our other non regulated operations, we have not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs related to tangible long lived assets through an adjustment to our depreciation rates for these assets. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. 53 Table of Contents On March 31, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS 143. FIN 47, which was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, clarifies that the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS 143 apply to asset retirement obligations in which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity. We identified conditional asset retirement obligations for (i) asbestos removal in buildings, (ii) removal of underground storage tanks, (iii) our property located on public and private rights of way and (iv) our property that is attached to poles owned by other utilities and municipalities. Due to a lack of historical experience from which to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, we concluded that an asset retirement obligation associated with our property located on rights of way is indeterminate. We also concluded that our conditional asset retirement obligations related to the removal of asbestos, underground storage tanks and our property that is attached to other entities poles was immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations and therefore has not been recognized. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) long lived assets and (v) income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe these critical accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. Certain of our interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association, with the exception of DSL related revenues which were removed from our pooled interstate tariff filing effective July 1, 2006 and are now recognized as revenues when billed. During 2004, we began generally recognizing such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless the actual achieved or projected rate of return was lower than authorized. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since July 2004, we have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe such tariffs are deemed lawful. There is no assurance that our future tariff filings will be deemed lawful. For those billings from tariffs prior to July 2004, we initially recorded as a liability our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return, and may thereafter recognize as revenue some or all of these amounts at the end of the applicable settlement period or as our legal entitlement thereto becomes certain. We recorded approximately $35.9 million as revenue in the third quarter of 2005 as the settlement period related to the 2001/2002 monitoring period lapsed on September 30, 2005. The amount of our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return reflected as a liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 for the 2003/2004 monitoring period aggregated approximately $43 million. The settlement period related to the 2003/2004 monitoring period lapses on September 30, 2007. 54 Table of Contents Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we may need to increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pension and postretirement benefits. The amounts recognized in our financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2006 and 2005, we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe reflects the expected long term rates of return in the financial markets. Another assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. Our discount rate at December 31, 2006 ranged from 5.75 5.80% compared to 5.5% at December 31, 2005, which we believe is the appropriate rate at which the pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled. Such rates were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of our expected cash outflows of our benefit plans. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual combined pension and postretirement expense approximately $3.0 million. Intangible and long lived assets. We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. We completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2006) under SFAS 142 and determined our goodwill was not impaired as of such date. 55 Table of Contents Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. Income taxes. We estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain income tax contingency reserves for potential assessments from the various taxing authorities. These reserves are estimated based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the tax contingencies and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances. Changes to the tax contingency reserves could materially affect operating results in the period of change. For additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters below, and the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. INFLATION Historically, we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time certain costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. However, LECs operating over 65% of our total access lines are now governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict or delay our ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes may further alter our ability to recover increased costs in our regulated operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes are limited to the rate of inflation, minus a productivity offset. As operating expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover the costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment. 56 Table of Contents MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be $2.5 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long term debt of 6.9% and an overall weighted maturity of 8 years compared to terms and rates available on such date in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 69 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately an $89.6 million decrease in the fair value of our long term debt. As of December 31, 2006, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 80% of our long term and short term debt obligations were fixed rate. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We periodically review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implement strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are fixed to variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.229% to the six month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August 2012. During 2006, we realized an average interest rate under these hedges of 9.03%. Interest expense was increased by $5.8 million during 2006 as a result of these hedges. The aggregate fair market value of these hedges was $20.6 million at December 31, 2006 and is reflected both as a liability and as a decrease in our underlying long term debt on the December 31, 2006 balance sheet. With respect to each of these hedges, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $13.3 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges at December 31, 2006, and would also increase our interest expense. 57 Table of Contents Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair value calculations. The analysis above incorporates only those risk exposures that existed as of December 31, 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide for our cash needs. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $840.7 million, $964.7 million and $955.8 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. As relief from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, certain of our affected subsidiaries were granted a deferral from making their remaining 2005 estimated federal income and excise tax payments until 2006. During 2006, we made payments of approximately $75 million to satisfy our remaining 2005 estimated payments. For additional information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $193.7 million, $481.4 million and $413.3 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We received approximately $122.8 million cash from the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB during 2006. See Note 15 for additional information. Cash used for acquisitions was $75.5 million in 2005 (due to the acquisition of fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC). Capital expenditures during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $314.1 million, $414.9 million and $385.3 million, respectively. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $780.2 million in 2006, $491.7 million in 2005 and $578.5 million in 2004. Payments of debt were $82.0 million in 2006, $693.3 million in 2005 and $179.4 million in 2004. In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 21.4 million shares (for $802.2 million), 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million), and 13.4 million shares (for $401.0 million) in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 repurchases include 14.36 million shares repurchased (for an aggregate final price of approximately $528.4 million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks (see Note 9 for additional information). We initially funded purchases under these agreements principally through borrowings under our $750 million credit facility and cash on hand and subsequently refinanced the credit facility borrowings through the issuance of short term commercial paper. The 2005 repurchases include 12.9 million shares repurchased (for an aggregate final price of $437.5 million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements (see below and Note 9 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information). 58 Table of Contents In February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at an interest rate of 4.628%. We received no proceeds in connection with the remarketing as all proceeds were held in trust to secure the obligation of our equity unit holders to purchase common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired approximately $400 million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million remaining outstanding. We incurred a pre tax charge of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring the notes. We purchased such notes with proceeds from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand. On May 16, 2005, upon settlement of 15.9 million of our outstanding equity units, we received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued approximately 12.9 million common shares. In late May 2005, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired 12.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate final price of $437.5 million, the proceeds of which came from the settlement of the equity units mentioned above and cash on hand. Other. For 2007, we have budgeted $325 million for capital expenditures. In 2006, we concluded that our prior extensive capital investment in our wireline network permitted us to reduce network capital spending to maintenance levels. We expect this to be the case for the foreseeable future. Our 2007 capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and expanding our data networks. 59 Table of Contents The following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006. Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 After 2011 (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 2,567,864 155,012 296,100 691,268 (2) 1,425,484 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 1,549,609 169,565 301,167 251,086 827,791 MRCC purchase price obligation (3) $ 336,000 336,000 (1) For additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Includes $165 million aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures, Series K, due 2032, which can be put to us at various dates beginning in 2010. (3) This amount represents an estimated purchase price based on MRCCs net indebtedness as of September 30, 2006 (see below for additional information). In December 2006, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Madison River Communications Corp. (MRCC) and its owner, Madison River Telephone Company, LLC. Under this agreement, we agreed to purchase all of the capital stock of MRCC in exchange for $830 million less MRCCs net indebtedness on the transactions closing date (which was approximately $494 million at September 30, 2006), subject to certain closing adjustments. We expect to initially fund this acquisition using borrowings under our existing credit facility and are currently reviewing our longer term options for repaying or refinancing these borrowings. We continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expect to continue our long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractively priced communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf registration statement. We also have access to debt and equity capital markets. 60 Table of Contents In December 2006, we secured a new five year, $750 million revolving credit facility. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.5 to 1. The interest rate on revolving loans under the facility is based on our choice of several prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional margin that varies depending on our credit ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility, the amount of which varies based on our credit ratings. Up to $150 million of the credit facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Available borrowings under our credit facility are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program borrowings in turn are effectively limited to the total amount available under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2006, we had no amounts outstanding under our new credit facility but did have $23 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) rates our long term debt Baa2 (with a stable outlook) and Standard & Poors (S&P) rates our long term debt BBB (with a negative outlook). Our commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A3 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $750 million revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to the capital markets, accelerate the conversion rights of holders of our outstanding convertible securities, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing our financial or operating flexibility. The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 2004 Debt to total capitalization 44.8 % 42.3 46.9 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.97 3.60 3.57 * For purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend costs. 61 Table of Contents REGULATION AND COMPETITION The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services. As a result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new services. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately 50% of our telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. Federal USF programs have recently undergone substantial changes, and are expected to experience more changes in the coming years. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five year period based on embedded, or historical, costs that provides relatively predictable levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs. In May 2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism until such time that new high cost support rules are adopted for rural telephone companies. Wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek eligible telecommunications carrier status in order to receive USF support, which, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on disbursements. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary to provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments we receive from the USF High Cost Loop support program. Increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all USF recipients caused our revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program to decrease in 2005 and 2006 from the amounts received in the prior year. However, based on recent FCC filings, we anticipate our 2007 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will approximate our 2006 levels. 62 Table of Contents During 2004, a joint board named by the FCC released a notice requesting comments on the FCCs current rules for the provision of high cost support for rural companies, including comments on whether eligibility requirements should be amended in a manner that would adversely affect larger rural LECs such as us. In addition, the FCC has taken various other steps in anticipation of restructuring universal service support mechanisms, which in the aggregate could substantially impact these support payments. In August 2005, the joint board sought comments on four separate proposals to modify the distribution of High Cost Loop support funds. In August 2006, the joint board sought comment on the viability of using competitive bidding to determine the amount of high cost funding for all eligible carriers. We anticipate that the joint board will make reform suggestions to the FCC by mid 2007, at which time the FCC would be required to seek comments. Due to the pending nature of these proposals, we cannot estimate the impact that such proposals would have on our operations. Recent technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Recently several large electric utilities have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs. Recent improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate, all distance calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs and may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services. Beginning in late 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted orders establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and industry negotiations are continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry segments. Until the FCCs proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact this proceeding will have on our results of operations. 63 Table of Contents Many cable, entertainment, technology or other communication companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Several of these companies started offering full service bundles before us, which could give them an advantage in building customer loyalty. Recent events affecting us. During the last few years, all of the states in which we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. State alternative regulation plans recently adopted by certain of our LECs have also affected revenue growth recently. These alternative regulation plans now govern over 65% of our access lines. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce their intrastate access tariffed rates. In addition, we have recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services. In 2006 we incurred a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $16.3 million compared to 2005 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease in 2005 compared to 2004 was $13.4 million. We believe this trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2007, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. While we expect our operating revenues in 2007 to continue to experience downward pressure primarily due to continued access line losses and reduced network access revenues, we expect such declines to be partially offset by increased demand for our fiber transport, high speed Internet and other nonregulated product offerings (including our new video and wireless initiatives). For a more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual report. Other matters. Our regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. 64 Table of Contents Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71 (SFAS 101), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. Depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 included regulatory liabilities of approximately $186.4 million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above). Net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $71.3 million. When and if our regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, we currently do not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we would be required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. We currently do not expect such revisions in asset lives will have a material impact on our results of operations. Upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we also would be required to eliminate certain intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that currently are not eliminated under the application of SFAS 71. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately $120 million of revenues (and related costs) would have been eliminated had we not been subject to the provisions of SFAS 71. Such elimination would have had no impact on total operating income. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. 65 Table of Contents We have certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2006 have not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
