Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW CenturyTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services, including local and long distance voice, Internet access and broadband services, to customers in 25 states. We currently derive our revenues from providing (i) local exchange and long distance voice services, (ii) network access services, (iii) data services, which includes both high speed (DSL) and dial up Internet services, as well as special access and private line services, (iv) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and (v) other related services. On April 30, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Madison River Communications Corp. (Madison River). See Note 2 for additional information. We have reflected the results of operations of the Madison River properties in our consolidated results of operations beginning May 1, 2007. On June 30, 2005, we acquired fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC Telecom Holdings, Inc. (KMC) for approximately $75.5 million cash and have reflected the results of operations of KMC in our consolidated results of operations beginning July 1, 2005. During 2007, we recognized approximately $49.0 million of network access revenues in connection with the settlement of a dispute with a carrier and approximately $42.2 million of revenues in connection with the lapse of a regulatory monitoring period (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues). Neither of these favorable revenue items in 2007 are expected to reoccur in the future. Effective January 1, 2007, we changed our relationship with our provider of satellite television service from a revenue sharing arrangement to an agency relationship and, in connection therewith, we received in the second quarter of 2007 a non recurring reimbursement of $5.9 million, of which $4.1 million was reflected as a reduction of cost of services (which we previously incurred as subscriber acquisition costs) and the remainder was reflected as revenues. This change has also resulted in us recognizing lower recurring revenues and lower recurring operating costs compared to our prior arrangement. In September 2007, we announced a reduction of our workforce to be completed by mid 2008 of approximately 200 jobs and, in connection therewith, incurred a net pre tax charge of approximately $2.2 million (consisting of a $2.7 million charge to operating expenses, net of a $527,000 favorable revenue impact related to such expenses as allowed through our rate making process) for severance and related costs. On March 1 and August 31, 2006, we announced workforce reductions involving an aggregate of approximately 400 jobs and, in connection therewith, incurred an aggregate net pre tax charge of approximately $7.5 million (consisting of a $9.4 million charge to operating expenses, net of a $1.9 million favorable revenue impact related to such expenses as allowed through our rate making process) for severance and related costs. See Note 8 for additional information. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a $16.6 million pre tax impairment charge in order to write down the value of certain long lived assets in certain of our CLEC markets to their estimated realizable value. The estimated realizable value was determined based on current proposals received during our sales process of such properties. In the third quarter of 2007, we recorded a one time pre tax gain of approximately $10.4 million related to the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership. In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded a one time pre tax gain of approximately $117.8 million upon redemption of our investment in the stock of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB). Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of 2007, upon final distribution of the remaining proceeds from the RTB dissolution, we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $5.2 million. See Note 15 for additional information. Our net income for 2007 was $418.4 million, compared to $370.0 million during 2006 and $334.5 million during 2005. Diluted earnings per share for 2007 was $3.72 compared to $3.07 in 2006 and $2.49 in 2005. The number of average diluted shares outstanding declined 7.5% in 2007 and 10.2% in 2006 primarily due to our share repurchases during the past three years. Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 793,078 665,538 736,403 Interest expense (212,906 ) (195,957 ) (201,801 ) Other income (expense) 38,770 121,568 3,168 Income tax expense (200,572 ) (221,122 ) (203,291 ) Net income $ 418,370 370,027 334,479 Basic earnings per share $ 3.82 3.17 2.55 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.72 3.07 2.49 Average basic shares outstanding 109,360 116,671 130,841 Average diluted shares outstanding 113,094 122,229 136,087 Operating income increased $127.5 million in 2007 as a $208.5 million increase in operating revenues was partially offset by an $81.0 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income decreased $70.9 million in 2006 due to a $31.5 million decrease in operating revenues and a $39.3 million increase in operating expenses. In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry; our ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities, including successfully integrating newly acquired businesses into our operations and retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; our continued access to credit markets on favorable terms; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business are described in greater detail in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward looking statements for any reason.

OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Voice $ 889,960 871,767 902,510 Network access 941,506 878,702 959,838 Data 460,755 351,495 318,770 Fiber transport and CLEC 159,317 149,088 115,454 Other 204,703 196,678 182,680 Operating revenues $ 2,656,241 2,447,730 2,479,252 During 2007 and 2005, we recognized revenues of approximately $42.2 million and $35.9 million, respectively, related to the expiration of regulatory monitoring periods. Of the $42.2 million recognized in 2007, approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues. Of the $35.9 million recognized in 2005, approximately $24.5 million is reflected in network access revenues and approximately $11.4 million is reflected in data revenues. In addition, in 2007 we recognized approximately $49.0 million of revenues related to the settlement of a dispute with a carrier. We do not expect this level of favorable revenue settlements to reoccur in the future. Revenues from voice mail services previously reflected in other revenues have been reclassified to voice revenues for all periods presented. Voice revenues. We derive voice revenues by providing local exchange telephone services and retail long distance services to customers in our service areas. The $18.2 million (2.1%) increase in voice revenues in 2007 is primarily due to $43.3 million of revenues attributable to the Madison River properties acquired April 30, 2007. Such increase was partially offset by (i) a $20.7 million decrease due to a 5.2% decline in the average number of access lines (normalized for acquisitions, dispositions and previously disclosed adjustments made during 2006) and (ii) a $6.0 million decline as a result of a decrease in revenues associated with extended area calling plans. The $30.7 million (3.4%) decrease in voice revenues in 2006 is primarily due to (i) a $22.3 million decrease due a 4.8% decline in the average number of access lines served and (ii) a $26.1 million decline as a result of a decrease in minutes of use in extended area calling plans in certain areas. Such decreases were partially offset by (i) a $12.6 million increase in long distance revenues primarily attributable to an increase in the number of long distance lines and increased long distance minutes of use, both of which were partially offset by a decline in the average rate we charged our long distance customers, and (ii) a $9.9 million increase due to providing custom calling features to more customers. Normalized for the adjustments mentioned above, access lines declined 119,700 (5.7%) during 2007 compared to a decline of 107,000 (4.8%) during 2006. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services. Based on our planned results for recent sales and retention initiatives, we are targeting our access line loss to be between 4.5% and 6.0% in 2008. Network access revenues. We derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms. Certain of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers (LECs) administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. Network access revenues increased $62.8 million (7.1%) in 2007 and decreased $81.1 million (8.5%) in 2006 due to the following factors: 2007 2006 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Settlement of a dispute with a carrier $ 48,987 Acquisition of Madison River 33,923 Expiration of regulatory monitoring periods 25,402 (24,556 ) Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use, decreased access rates in certain states and recovery from state support funds (20,912 ) (19,201 ) Partial recovery of operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return on rate base (21,311 ) (16,825 ) Recovery from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program 2,231 (11,637 ) Prior year revenue settlement agreements (2,346 ) (6,663 ) Other, net (3,170 ) (2,254 ) $ 62,804 (81,136 ) In March 2006, we filed a complaint against a carrier for recovery of unpaid and underpaid access charges for calls made using the carriers prepaid calling cards and calls that used Internet Protocol for a portion of their transmission. The carrier filed a counterclaim against us, asserting that we improperly billed them terminating intrastate access charges on certain wireless roaming traffic. In April 2007, we entered into a settlement agreement with the carrier and received approximately $49 million cash from them related to the issues described above. This amount is reflected in our 2007 results of operations as a component of Network access revenues. In third quarter 2007, upon the lapse of the applicable 2003/2004 monitoring period for certain of our tariffed billings, we recognized approximately $42.2 million of revenues (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues). Such amount represented billings from tariffs prior to July 2004 in excess of the authorized rate of return that we initially recorded as a deferred credit pending completion of such 2003/2004 monitoring period. Our revenues from the Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund increased approximately $2.2 million in 2007 after decreasing $11.6 million in 2006. Such decrease in 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. We anticipate our 2008 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program will decrease between $14 and $17 million compared to 2007. In 2007 and 2006, we experienced reductions in our intrastate revenues of approximately $20.9 million and $19.2 million, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services). We believe that intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2008, although we cannot estimate the magnitude of such decrease. Data revenues. We derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services (both DSL and dial up services) and data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues in 2007 increased $109.3 million (31.1%) substantially due to (i) a $66.4 million increase in DSL related revenues due primarily to growth in the number of DSL customers; (ii) $34.5 million of revenues contributed by Madison River and (iii) $16.8 million of one time revenues recorded in third quarter 2007 upon expiration of the above described regulatory monitoring period. Such increases were partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in special access revenues primarily due to certain customers disconnecting circuits and a $5.1 million decrease in dial up Internet revenues due to a decline in the number of dial up customers. Data revenues increased $32.7 million (10.3%) in 2006, substantially due to a $54.0 million increase in DSL related revenues primarily due to growth in the number of high speed Internet customers. Such increase was partially offset by a decrease in prior year revenue settlements due to the above described recognition of approximately $11.4 million of revenues in third quarter 2005 upon the lapse of a regulatory monitoring period and a $4.9 million decrease due to a reduced number of dial up Internet customers. Fiber transport and CLEC. Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring businesses. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $10.2 million (6.9%) in 2007, of which $8.7 million was due to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business and $4.8 million was contributed by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in CLEC revenues primarily due to customer disconnects. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $33.6 million (29.1%) in 2006, of which $24.4 million was due to revenues from the fiber assets acquired on June 30, 2005 from KMC and $8.5 million was attributable to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business. Other revenues. We derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii) providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating in the publication of local directories and (iv) providing new service offerings, principally consisting of our new video and wireless reseller services. Other revenues increased $8.0 million (4.1%) in 2007. Such increase was primarily due to $13.9 million of revenues contributed by Madison River. In connection with receiving a one time reimbursement as a result of our above described change in our contractual relationship with our satellite television service provider, we recorded a $1.9 million one time increase to revenues in 2007. The impact of the change in the arrangement from a gross to a net revenue presentation resulted in an $8.2 million decrease in recurring revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Other revenues increased $14.0 million (7.7%) during 2006 primarily due to a $12.1 million increase in revenues of our video and wireless reseller offerings and a $2.5 million increase in directory revenues. OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 937,375 888,414 821,929 Selling, general and administrative 389,533 370,272 388,989 Depreciation and amortization 536,255 523,506 531,931 Operating expenses $ 1,863,163 1,782,192 1,742,849 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $49.0 million (5.5%) in 2007 primarily due to (i) $52.5 million of costs incurred by our Madison River properties; (ii) a $20.9 million increase in DSL related expenses due to growth in the number of DSL customers; (iii) a $16.6 million impairment charge related to certain of our CLEC assets that we expect to sell in the near term; and (iv) a $7.8 million increase in expenses associated with pole attachments primarily due to rate increases. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $33.1 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to costs associated with workforce reductions in 2006 and due to fewer incumbent employees resulting from our recent workforce reductions and (ii) a $19.7 million decrease in expenses associated with our satellite television service offering due to a change in our arrangement as mentioned above (such reduction includes a $4.1 million one time reimbursement of costs received from the service provider in 2007 in connection with the change in the arrangement, as described above). Cost of services and products increased $66.5 million (8.1%) in 2006 primarily due to (i) an $18.9 million increase in expenses incurred by the properties acquired from KMC; (ii) an $18.3 million increase in costs associated with growth in our long distance business; (iii) a $14.3 million increase in expenses associated with our video and wireless reseller service offerings; (iv) an $11.5 million increase in Internet operating expenses primarily due to growth in the number of high speed Internet customers; and (v) $8.6 million of severance and related costs associated with our workforce reduction in 2006 (see Note 8). Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.3 million (5.2%) in 2007 primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of costs incurred by Madison River; (ii) an $8.2 million increase in salaries and benefits; and (iii) a $5.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $5.7 million reduction in bad debt expense and (ii) a $4.3 million decrease in information technology expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $18.7 million (4.8%) in 2006 primarily due to an $11.0 million decrease in marketing expenses; a $10.6 million reduction in information technology expenses; an $8.7 million reduction in bad debt expense; and a $5.8 million decrease in operating taxes. These decreases were partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in salaries and benefits and a $5.5 million increase in expenses incurred from the properties acquired from KMC. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $12.7 million (2.4%) in 2007 primarily due to $32.5 million of depreciation and amortization incurred by Madison River and a $14.8 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service. Such increases were substantially offset by a $31.7 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization decreased $8.4 million (1.6%) in 2006, primarily due to a $25.3 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decrease was partially offset by (i) a $16.6 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service and (ii) a $3.1 million increase due to depreciation and amortization of the properties acquired from KMC. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased $16.9 million (8.6%) in 2007 compared to 2006. A $22.7 million increase due to increased average debt outstanding (primarily due to the $750 million of senior notes issued in March 2007 to fund the Madison River acquisition) was partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased $5.8 million (2.9%) in 2006 compared to 2005 as a $10.5 million decrease due primarily to a decrease in average debt outstanding was partially offset by a $7.1 million increase due to higher average interest rates. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to our core operations, including gains or losses from nonoperating asset dispositions and impairments, our share of the income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during construction. Other income (expense) was $38.8 million in 2007, $121.6 million in 2006 and $3.2 million in 2005. The years 2007, 2006 and 2005 were impacted by certain charges and credits that are not expected to occur in the future. The year 2007 include a non recurring pre tax gain of $10.4 million related to the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership and a $5.2 million pre tax gain resulting from the final distribution of funds from the RTB redemption mentioned below. Included in 2006 were pre tax gains of approximately $118.6 million (substantially all of which related to the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB), which was partially offset by pre tax charges of approximately $11.7 million due to the impairment of certain non operating investments. Included in 2005 was (i) a $16.2 million pre tax charge due to the impairment of a non operating investment; (ii) a $4.8 million debt extinguishment expense related to purchasing and retiring approximately $400 million of our Senior J notes; (iii) $3.2 million of non recurring interest income related to the settlement of various income tax audits; and (iv) a $3.5 million gain from the sale of a non operating investment. Our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership increased $8.7 million in 2007 compared to 2006. Such increase was partially due to favorable adjustments recorded in 2007 that resulted from the unaffiliated general partner completing the audited financial statements of this partnership for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Previously for these time periods, we had recorded our share of the partnership income based on unaudited results of operations. INCOME TAX EXPENSE The effective income tax rate was 32.4%, 37.4%, and 37.8% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $32.7 million in 2007 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits (see below and Note 12). Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $6.4 million in 2006 due to the resolution of various income tax audit issues. Income tax expense for 2005 was increased by $19.5 million as a result of increasing the valuation allowance related to net state operating loss carryforwards. This increase was primarily due to changes in state income tax laws and other factors which impacted the projections of future taxable income. This tax expense increase was more than offset by (i) a reduction of state income tax reserves ($11.6 million, net of federal income tax benefit); (ii) a reduction in our composite state income tax rate due to more income being apportioned to states with lower state tax rates ($8.5 million); and (iii) the favorable settlement of various federal income tax audits ($1.3 million). ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements. FIN 48 required us, effective January 1, 2007, to recognize and measure tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclose uncertainties in income tax positions. See Note 12 for additional information related to our income tax uncertainties. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2008. We currently do not expect SFAS 157 to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 was effective for our December 31, 2006 balance sheet and required us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and postretirement plans as an asset or liability on our balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss) and to stockholders equity, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As a result of the implementation of SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, our non current assets decreased $64.7 million, our current liabilities decreased $898,000, our non current liabilities (excluding deferred income taxes) increased approximately $99.5 million, our deferred income taxes decreased approximately $65.4 million and our stockholders equity (reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss) decreased approximately $97.9 million. See Note 1 for additional information. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet approach and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of the relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. We adopted SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Upon the implementation of SAB 108, we recognized a net $9.7 million increase to January 1, 2006 retained earnings for the cumulative effect of correcting prior year uncorrected misstatements. See Note 1 for additional information. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although we generally have no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. For our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject to SFAS 71) and our other non regulated operations, we have not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs related to tangible long lived assets through an adjustment to our depreciation rates for these assets. On March 31, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47), an interpretation of SFAS 143. FIN 47, which was effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, clarifies that the recognition and measurement provisions of SFAS 143 apply to asset retirement obligations in which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within control of the entity. We identified conditional asset retirement obligations for (i) asbestos removal in buildings, (ii) removal of underground storage tanks, (iii) our property located on public and private rights of way and (iv) our property that is attached to poles owned by other utilities and municipalities. Due to a lack of historical experience from which to reasonably estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates, we concluded that an asset retirement obligation associated with our property located on rights of way is indeterminate. We also concluded that our conditional asset retirement obligations related to the removal of asbestos, underground storage tanks and our property that is attached to other entities poles was immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations and therefore has not been recognized. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) intangible and long lived assets and (v) income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe these critical accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. Certain of our interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association, with the exception of DSL related revenues which were removed from our pooled interstate tariff filing effective July 1, 2006 and are now recognized as revenues when billed. During 2004, we began generally recognizing such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless the actual achieved or projected rate of return was lower than authorized. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since July 2004, we have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe such tariffs are deemed lawful. There is no assurance that our future tariff filings will be deemed lawful. For those billings from tariffs prior to July 2004, we initially recorded as a deferred credit our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return. Upon the lapse of the applicable regulatory monitoring periods, we recorded approximately $42.2 million as revenue in 2007 and approximately $35.9 million as revenue in 2005. We do not expect these favorable revenue settlements to reoccur in the future. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we may need to increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pension and postretirement benefits. The amounts recognized in our financial statements related to pension and postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis, which utilizes many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts. A significant assumption used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2007 and 2006, we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe reflects the expected long term rates of return in the financial markets. Another assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. Our discount rate at December 31, 2007 ranged from 6.3 6.5% compared to 5.75 5.80% at December 31, 2006, which we believe is the appropriate rate at which the pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled. Such rates were determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual combined pension and postretirement expense approximately $1.7 million. Intangible and long lived assets. We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization). If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. We completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2007) under SFAS 142 and determined our goodwill was not impaired as of such date. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. We recognized a $16.6 million pre tax impairment charge in 2007 related to certain of our CLEC assets that we expect to sell. Income taxes. We estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in our tax returns. These liabilities are estimated based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances. Changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of change. During 2007, we released approximately $32.7 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits (including related interest and net of federal benefit) in accordance with FIN 48. Such benefit was recorded primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of audits, administrative practices and the lapse of statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions. See Note 12 for additional information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits. For additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters below, and the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. INFLATION Historically, we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time certain costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. However, LECs operating over 72% of our total access lines are now governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict or delay our ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes and competitive situations may further alter our ability to recover increased costs in our regulated operations. For the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes for certain revenue components are limited to the rate of inflation. As operating expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover the costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2007, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be $3.0 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long term debt of 6.6% and an overall weighted maturity of 8 years compared to terms and rates available on such date in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 66 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $106 million decrease in the fair value of our long term debt. As of December 31, 2007, after giving effect to interest rate swaps currently in place, approximately 83% of our long term debt obligations were fixed rate. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We periodically review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implement strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2007, we had outstanding four fair value interest rate hedges associated with the full $500 million aggregate principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due 2012, that pay interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%. These hedges are fixed to variable interest rate swaps that effectively convert our fixed rate interest payment obligations under these notes into obligations to pay variable rates that range from the six month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 3.229% to the six month LIBOR plus 3.67%, with settlement and rate reset dates occurring each six months through the expiration of the hedges in August 2012. During 2007, we realized an average interest rate under these hedges of 8.70% and interest expense was greater than it would have otherwise been by $4.1 million during 2007 as a result of these hedges. The aggregate fair market value of these hedges was $3.0 million at December 31, 2007 and is reflected both as an asset and as an increase in our underlying long term debt on the December 31, 2007 balance sheet. With respect to each of these hedges, market risk is estimated as the potential change in the fair value of the hedge resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates used to determine the fair value. A hypothetical 10% increase in the forward rates would result in a $9.6 million decrease in the fair value of these hedges at December 31, 2007, and would also increase our interest expense. In third quarter 2007, we entered into a hedge transaction that effectively locked in the interest rate for the six month period ended February 2008 related to the $500 million of Series L notes that previously were effectively converted to variable rate notes pursuant to the fixed to variable interest rate swaps described above. This hedge did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore is adjusted to its fair value each period (with a corresponding adjustment through the income statement). In January 2008, we terminated all of our existing derivatives (including those described above) and received a net cash settlement of approximately $20.7 million in connection therewith. See Note 20 for additional information regarding the termination of our derivatives. In anticipation of the issuance of Senior Notes in connection with the Madison River acquisition, we entered into four cash flow hedges that effectively locked in the interest rate on an aggregate of $400 million of debt. The issuance of these Senior Notes was completed in late March 2007 with the issuance of $500 million of 6.0% Senior Notes, due 2017, and $250 million of 5.5% Senior Notes, due 2013. We locked in the interest rate on (i) $200 million of 10 year debt at 5.0675% and (ii) $200 million of 10 year debt at 5.05%. In March 2007, upon settlement of the hedges, we received an aggregate of $765,000 cash, which is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the 10 year term of the debt. During 2007, we also reviewed our exposure to risks related to the assets in our investment portfolios (including our pension plan assets) in connection with the market volatility related to the sub prime credit market issues and other economic factors. These unfavorable economic factors did not have a material adverse impact on the valuation of the assets in our investment portfolios. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair value calculations. The analysis above incorporates only those risk exposures that existed as of December 31, 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide for our cash needs. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion, $840.7 million and $967.1 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. As relief from the effects of Hurricane Katrina, certain of our affected subsidiaries were granted a deferral from making their remaining 2005 estimated federal income and excise tax payments until 2006. During 2006, we made payments of approximately $75 million to satisfy our remaining 2005 estimated payments. For additional information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $619.2 million, $193.7 million and $483.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We used $306.8 million of cash (net of approximately $20.0 million of acquired cash) to purchase Madison River Communications Corp. (Madison River) and pay related closing costs on April 30, 2007 (see below and Note 2 for additional information). Cash used for acquisitions was $75.5 million in 2005 (due to the acquisition of fiber assets in 16 metropolitan markets from KMC). We received approximately $122.8 million cash from the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB during 2006. See Note 15 for additional information. Capital expenditures during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $326.0 million, $314.1 million and $414.9 million, respectively. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $402.1 million in 2007, $780.2 million in 2006 and $491.7 million in 2005. In late March 2007, we publicly issued an aggregate of $750 million of Senior Notes (see Note 5 for additional information). The net proceeds from the issuance of such Senior Notes aggregated approximately $741.8 million and were used (along with cash on hand and approximately $50 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program) to (i) finance the initial purchase price for the April 30, 2007 acquisition of Madison River ($322 million) and (ii) pay off Madison Rivers existing indebtedness (including accrued interest) at closing ($522 million). We invested the cash proceeds from the debt offering in short term cash equivalents prior to the acquisition of Madison River. Payments of debt were $713.0 million in 2007, $82.0 million in 2006 and $693.3 million in 2005. In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 10.2 million shares (for $460.7 million), 21.4 million shares (for $802.2 million), and 16.4 million shares (for $551.8 million) in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2006 repurchases include 14.36 million shares repurchased (for an aggregate final adjusted price of approximately $528.4 million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks (see Note 9 for additional information). We initially funded purchases under these agreements principally through borrowings under our $750 million credit facility and cash on hand and subsequently refinanced the credit facility borrowings through the issuance of short term commercial paper. The 2005 repurchases include 12.9 million shares repurchased (for an aggregate final price of $437.5 million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements (see below and Note 9 to the accompanying financial statements for additional information). As described further in Note 5, we called for redemption on August 14, 2007, all of our $165 million aggregate principal amount of Series K convertible senior debentures, subject to the right of holders to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $40.455. In lieu of cash redemption, holders of approximately $149.6 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 3.7 million shares of CenturyTel common stock. The remaining $15.4 million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash (including premium and accrued and unpaid interest). In February 2005, we remarketed substantially all of our $500 million of outstanding Series J senior notes due 2007 at an interest rate of 4.628%. We received no proceeds in connection with the remarketing as all proceeds were held in trust to secure the obligation of our equity unit holders to purchase common stock from us on May 16, 2005. In connection with the remarketing, we purchased and retired approximately $400 million of the notes, resulting in approximately $100 million remaining outstanding through their maturity in May 2007. We incurred a pre tax charge of approximately $6 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to purchasing and retiring the notes. We purchased such notes with proceeds from the February 2005 issuance of $350 million of 5% senior notes, Series M, due 2015 and cash on hand. On May 16, 2005, upon settlement of 15.9 million of our outstanding equity units, we received proceeds of approximately $398.2 million and issued approximately 12.9 million common shares. In late May 2005, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks whereby we repurchased and retired 12.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate final price of $437.5 million, the proceeds of which came from the settlement of the equity units mentioned above and cash on hand. Other. For 2008, we have budgeted $300 million for capital expenditures. In 2006, we concluded that our prior extensive capital investment in our wireline network permitted us to reduce network capital spending to maintenance levels. Our 2008 capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and expanding our data networks. In the first quarter of 2008, we paid a $25.0 million deposit to the FCC to enable us to participate in its auction of 700 MHz spectrum, which is still ongoing. Our deposit will be credited against the cost of any spectrum purchased by us in the auction. The following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. Payments due by period After Contractual obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2012 and Other (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 3,014,255 279,898 528,143 522,587 1,683,627 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 1,525,455 187,192 359,314 266,915 712,034 Unrecognized tax benefits (2) $ 31,981 31,981 (1) For additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay assuming we are required to pay the entire amount that we have reserved for our unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 12 for additional information). The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the After 2012 and Other column in the above table. We continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expect to continue our long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractively priced communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf registration statement. We also have access to debt and equity capital markets. We have available a five year, $750 million revolving credit facility which expires in December 2011. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.5 to 1. The interest rate on revolving loans under the facility is based on our choice of several prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional margin that varies depending on our credit ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility, the amount of which varies based on our credit ratings. Up to $150 million of the credit facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Available borrowings under our credit facility are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program borrowings in turn are effectively limited to the total amount available under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2007, we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility or commercial paper program. Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) rates our long term debt Baa2 (with a stable outlook) and Standard & Poors (S&P) rates our long term debt BBB (with a negative outlook). Our commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A3 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $750 million revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing our financial or operating flexibility. The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Our debt to capitalization ratio has increased primarily due to share repurchases we have made during the last few years. 2007 2006 2005 Debt to total capitalization 46.9 % 44.8 42.3 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.87 3.97 3.60 * For purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend costs. REGULATION AND COMPETITION The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services. As a result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, offer fixed rate calling plans, improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new services. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately half of our telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. Prior to and since the enactment of the 1996 Act, the FCC and a number of state legislative and regulatory bodies have also taken steps to foster local exchange competition. Coincident with this recent movement toward increased competition has been the reduction of regulatory oversight of LECs. These cumulative changes, coupled with various technological developments, have led to the continued growth of various companies providing services that compete with LECs services. Federal USF programs have undergone substantial changes since 1997, and are expected to experience more changes in the coming years as modernization of the overall program moves forward. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five year period based on embedded, or historical, costs that provide relatively predictable levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs. In May 2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism until such time that new high cost support rules are adopted for rural telephone companies. Wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek to qualify to receive USF support. This trend, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on disbursements. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments we receive from the USF High Cost Loop support program. While our 2007 USF High Cost Loop support program receipts approximated 2006 levels, we anticipate that our 2008 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will be lower than 2007 by approximately $14 17 million. Since May 2007, the FCC and the Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service have each proposed a series of reforms that could, if adopted, substantially restructure current USF programs. Until the FCC acts on those recommendations or issues final rules, we cannot estimate the impact that such proposals would have on our operations. In addition, there are a number of judicial appeals challenging several aspects of the FCCs universal service rules and various Congressional proposals seeking to substantially modify USF programs, none of which have been resolved at this time. We will continue to be active in monitoring these developments. Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Additionally, several large electric utilities have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs. Improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate, all distance calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs and may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services. In late 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted orders establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and industry negotiations are continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry segments. Until the FCCs proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact this proceeding will have on our results of operations. Many cable, entertainment, technology or other communication companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Several of these companies started offering full service bundles before us, which could give them an advantage in building customer loyalty. Recent events affecting us. During the last few years, all of the states in which we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce their intrastate access tariffed rates. In addition, we have recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services. In 2007 we incurred a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $20.9 million compared to 2006 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was $19.2 million. We believe this trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2008, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. We expect our operating revenues in 2008 to decline as we continue to experience downward pressure primarily due to continued access line losses, reduced network access revenues and lower prior year revenue settlement amounts. We expect such declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand for our high speed Internet service offering and the impact of recognizing a full year of revenues associated with our Madison River properties acquired in April 2007. For a more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual report. Other matters. Our regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. We are monitoring the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71 (SFAS 101), specifies the accounting required when an enterprise ceases to meet the criteria for application of SFAS 71. SFAS 101 requires the elimination of the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities in accordance with SFAS 71 but would not have been recognized as assets and liabilities by nonregulated enterprises. Depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007 included regulatory liabilities of approximately $198.4 million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above). Net deferred income tax assets related to the regulatory assets and liabilities quantified above were $77.0 million. When and if our regulated operations no longer qualify for the application of SFAS 71, we currently do not expect to record any impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we would be required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. We currently do not expect such revisions in asset lives will have a material impact on our results of operations. Upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we also would be required to eliminate certain intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that currently are not eliminated under the application of SFAS 71. For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately $146 million of revenues (and related costs) would have been eliminated had we not been subject to the provisions of SFAS 71. Such elimination would have had no impact on total operating income. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries will not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. We have certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2007 have not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
