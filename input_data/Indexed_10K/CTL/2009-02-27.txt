Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW CenturyTel, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to customers in 25 states. We currently derive our revenues from providing (i) local exchange and long distance voice services, (ii) network access services, (iii) data services, which include both high speed (DSL) and dial up Internet services, as well as special access and private line services, (iv) fiber transport, competitive local exchange and security monitoring services and (v) other related services. On October 26, 2008, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Embarq Corporation (EMBARQ) in a stock for stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement, EMBARQ shareholders will receive 1.37 CenturyTel shares for each share of EMBARQ common stock they own at closing. On December 31, 2008, EMBARQ had outstanding approximately 142.4 million shares of common stock and $5.7 billion of long term debt. The two companies have a combined operating presence in 33 states with approximately 7.7 million access lines and two million broadband customers. Completion of the transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, including approvals from the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public service commissions, as well as other customary closing conditions. Subject to these conditions, we anticipate closing this transaction in the second quarter of 2009. For additional information, see Item 1 of Part I of this annual report and Note 1. As further discussed in Note 11, during the second quarter of 2008, we recognized an $8.2 million curtailment loss (reflected in selling, general and administrative expense) in connection with amending our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). We also recognized a $4.5 million pre tax gain (reflected in other income (expense)) upon liquidation of our investments in marketable securities in the SERP trust in the second quarter of 2008. We will record a one time settlement charge in the first quarter of 2009 of approximately $7.7 million in connection with the lump sum distributions made in early 2009. In 2008 and 2007, we recognized net after tax benefits of approximately $12.8 million and $32.7 million, respectively, related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 12 for additional information. On April 30, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Madison River Communications Corp. (Madison River). See Note 2 for additional information. We have reflected the results of operations of the Madison River properties in our consolidated results of operations beginning May 1, 2007. 50 In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a $16.6 million pre tax impairment charge in order to write down the value of certain long lived assets in six of our northern competitive local exchange carrier markets to their estimated realizable value. We determined the estimated realizable value based on proposals received during our sales process of such properties commenced in 2007. We sold such properties in separate transactions in May and July 2008. Results of operations for these markets are included in our consolidated results of operations up to the respective sales dates. During 2007, we recognized approximately $49.0 million of network access revenues in connection with the settlement of a dispute with a carrier and approximately $42.2 million of revenues in connection with the lapse of a regulatory monitoring period (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues). We do not expect this level of favorable revenue settlements to reoccur in the future. Effective January 1, 2007, we changed our relationship with our provider of satellite television service from a revenue sharing arrangement to an agency relationship and, in connection therewith, we received in the second quarter of 2007 a non recurring reimbursement of $5.9 million, of which $4.1 million was reflected as a reduction of cost of services (which we previously incurred as subscriber acquisition costs) and the remainder was reflected as revenues. This change has also resulted in us recognizing higher levels of operating income compared to our prior arrangement. Over each of the past few years, we announced reductions of our workforce of an aggregate of approximately 700 jobs and, in connection therewith, incurred net pre tax charges of approximately $1.7 million in 2008, $2.2 million in 2007 and $7.5 million in 2006 for severance and related costs. See Note 8 for additional information. In the second quarter of 2006, we recorded a one time pre tax gain of approximately $117.8 million upon redemption of our investment in the stock of the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB). Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of 2007, upon final distribution of the remaining proceeds from the RTB dissolution, we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $5.2 million. See Note 15 for additional information. During the last several years (exclusive of acquisitions and certain non recurring favorable adjustments), we have experienced revenue declines in our voice and network access revenues primarily due to the loss of access lines and minutes of use. To mitigate these declines, we hope to, among other things, (i) promote long term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services, (ii) provide new services, such as video and wireless broadband, and other additional services that may become available in the future due to advances in technology, wireless spectrum sales by the Federal Communications Commission or improvements in our infrastructure, (iii) provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers, (iv) pursue acquisitions of additional communications properties if available at attractive prices, (v) increase usage of our networks and (vi) market our products to new customers. 51 Our net income for 2008 was $365.7 million, compared to $418.4 million during 2007 and $370.0 million during 2006. Diluted earnings per share for 2008 was $3.56 compared to $3.72 in 2007 and $3.07 in 2006. The number of average diluted shares outstanding declined 9.0% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2007 primarily due to our share repurchases during the past three years. Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 721,352 793,078 665,538 Interest expense (202,217 ) (212,906 ) (195,957 ) Other income (expense) 40,954 38,770 121,568 Income tax expense (194,357 ) (200,572 ) (221,122 ) Net income $ 365,732 418,370 370,027 Basic earnings per share $ 3.57 3.82 3.17 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.56 3.72 3.07 Average basic shares outstanding 102,268 109,360 116,671 Average diluted shares outstanding 102,871 113,094 122,229 Operating income decreased $71.7 million in 2008 due to a $56.5 million decrease in operating revenues and a $15.2 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income increased $127.5 million in 2007 as a $208.5 million increase in operating revenues was partially offset by an $81.0 million increase in operating expenses. 52 In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry (including the FCCs proposed rules regarding intercarrier compensation and the Universal Service Fund described elsewhere herein); our ability to effectively adjust to changes in the communications industry; our ability to successfully complete our pending merger with EMBARQ, including timely receiving all regulatory approvals and realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction; our ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities, including successfully integrating newly acquired businesses into our operations and retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; our continued access to credit markets on favorable terms; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; our ability to pay a $2.80 per common share dividend annually, which may be affected by changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business and our pending acquisition of EMBARQ are described in greater detail in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward looking statements for any reason. All references to Notes in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Voice $ 874,041 889,960 871,767 Network access 820,383 941,506 878,702 Data 524,194 460,755 351,495 Fiber transport and CLEC 162,050 159,317 149,088 Other 219,079 204,703 196,678 Operating revenues $ 2,599,747 2,656,241 2,447,730 During 2007, we recognized revenues of approximately $42.2 million related to the expiration of a regulatory monitoring period, of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues. In addition, in 2007 we recognized approximately $49.0 million of network access revenues related to the settlement of a dispute with a carrier. We do not expect this level of favorable revenue settlements to reoccur in the future. 53 Voice revenues. We derive voice revenues by providing local exchange telephone services and retail long distance services to customers in our service areas. The $15.9 million (1.8%) decrease in voice revenues in 2008 is primarily due to (i) a $22.5 million decrease due to a 5.9% decline in the average number of access lines (exclusive of our acquisition of Madison River properties); (ii) a $10.8 million decrease in custom calling feature revenues primarily due to the continued migration to bundled service offerings at a lower effective rate; and (iii) a $7.7 million decline as a result of a decrease in revenues associated with extended area calling plans. These decreases were partially offset by $17.0 million of additional revenues attributable to the Madison River properties acquired April 30, 2007 and a $9.9 million increase in long distance revenues attributable to an increase in the percentage of our customer base on fixed rate unlimited calling plans and the implementation of rate increases applicable to several rate plans in late 2007 and early 2008. The $18.2 million (2.1%) increase in voice revenues in 2007 is primarily due to $43.3 million of revenues attributable to the Madison River properties acquired April 30, 2007. Such increase was partially offset by (i) a $20.7 million decrease due to a 5.2% decline in the average number of access lines (normalized for acquisitions, dispositions and previously disclosed adjustments made during 2006) and (ii) a $6.0 million decline as a result of a decrease in revenues associated with extended area calling plans. Total access lines declined 136,800 (6.4%) during 2008 compared to a normalized decline of 119,700 (5.7%) during 2007. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during 2008 and 2007 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services and recent economic conditions. Based on our current retention initiatives, we estimate that our access line loss will be between 5.7% and 6.7% in 2009. Network access revenues. We derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions and (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms. Certain of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); the remainder of such revenues are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other local exchange carriers (LECs) administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. Intrastate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed with state regulatory agencies or are derived under revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs. 54 Network access revenues decreased $121.1 million (12.9%) in 2008 and increased $62.8 million (7.1%) in 2007 due to the following factors: 2008 2007 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Favorable settlement of a dispute with a carrier in 2007 $ (48,987 ) 48,987 Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use, decreased access rates in certain states and recovery from state support funds (29,022 ) (20,912 ) Revenue recognition upon expiration of regulatory monitoring periods in 2007 (25,402 ) 25,402 Partial recovery of operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return on rate base (15,857 ) (21,311 ) Recovery from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program (14,596 ) 2,231 Acquisition of Madison River 12,345 33,923 Prior year revenue settlement agreements 1,922 (2,346 ) Other, net (1,526 ) (3,170 ) $ (121,123 ) 62,804 In March 2006, we filed a complaint against a carrier for recovery of unpaid and underpaid access charges for calls made using the carriers prepaid calling cards and calls that used Internet Protocol for a portion of their transmission. The carrier filed a counterclaim against us, asserting that we improperly billed them terminating intrastate access charges on certain wireless roaming traffic. In April 2007, we entered into a settlement agreement with the carrier and received approximately $49 million cash from them related to the issues described above. In 2008 and 2007, we experienced reductions in our intrastate revenues of approximately $29.0 million and $20.9 million, respectively, primarily due to a reduction in intrastate minutes (partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services). We believe that intrastate minutes will continue to decline in 2009, although we cannot estimate the magnitude of such decrease. In third quarter 2007, upon the lapse of the applicable 2003/2004 monitoring period for certain of our tariffed billings, we recognized approximately $42.2 million of revenues (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues). Such amount represented billings from tariffs prior to July 2004 in excess of the authorized rate of return that we initially recorded as a deferred credit pending completion of such 2003/2004 monitoring period. Our revenues from the Universal Service High Cost Loop Fund decreased approximately $14.6 million in 2008 and increased $2.2 million in 2007. Such decrease in 2008 was primarily due to an increase in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used by the FCC to allocate funds among all recipients. We anticipate our 2009 revenues from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program will decrease between $12 and $14 million compared to 2008. 55 Data revenues. We derive our data revenues primarily by providing Internet access services (both DSL and dial up services) and data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues increased $63.4 million (13.8%) in 2008 substantially due to (i) a $57.8 million increase in DSL related revenues primarily due to growth in the number of DSL customers and (ii) $16.3 million of additional revenues contributed by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by $16.8 million of one time revenues recorded in third quarter 2007 upon expiration of the previously described regulatory monitoring period. While we expect our data revenues to increase in 2009 as compared to 2008, we do not expect to recognize the same level of increase as we experienced in 2008 primarily due to the fact that our customer base is more highly penetrated with DSL services. Data revenues increased $109.3 million (31.1%) in 2007 substantially due to (i) a $66.4 million increase in DSL related revenues due primarily to growth in the number of DSL customers; (ii) $34.5 million of revenues contributed by Madison River and (iii) $16.8 million of one time revenues recorded in third quarter 2007 upon expiration of the previously described regulatory monitoring period. Such increases were partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in special access revenues primarily due to certain customers disconnecting circuits and a $5.1 million decrease in dial up Internet revenues due to a decline in the number of dial up customers. Fiber transport and CLEC. Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring businesses. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $2.7 million (1.7%) in 2008, of which $6.4 million was due to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business and $2.5 million was due to additional revenue contributed by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease due to the sales of six CLEC markets that were consummated in the second and third quarters of 2008 and a $3.5 million decrease in CLEC revenues primarily due to customer disconnects. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $10.2 million (6.9%) in 2007, of which $8.7 million was due to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business and $4.8 million was contributed by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in CLEC revenues primarily due to customer disconnects. Other revenues. We derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring, (ii) providing billing and collection services for third parties, (iii) participating in the publication of local directories and (iv) providing new service offerings, principally consisting of our new video and wireless reseller services. Other revenues increased $14.4 million (7.0%) in 2008 primarily due to (i) $7.7 million of additional revenues contributed by Madison River and (ii) a $2.8 million increase in directory revenues. 56 Other revenues increased $8.0 million (4.1%) in 2007 primarily due to $13.9 million of revenues contributed by Madison River. In connection with receiving a one time reimbursement as a result of our above described change in our contractual relationship with our satellite television service provider, we recorded a $1.9 million one time increase to revenues in 2007. The impact of the change in the arrangement from a gross to a net revenue presentation resulted in an $8.2 million decrease in recurring revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 955,473 937,375 888,414 Selling, general and administrative 399,136 389,533 370,272 Depreciation and amortization 523,786 536,255 523,506 Operating expenses $ 1,878,395 1,863,163 1,782,192 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $18.1 million (1.9%) in 2008 primarily due to (i) $22.7 million of additional costs incurred by the Madison River properties; (ii) a $12.3 million increase in DSL related expenses due to growth in the number of DSL customers; (iii) a $4.9 million increase in costs associated with our recently launched switched digital video offering; and (iv) a $4.1 million increase due to a one time reimbursement of costs received from our satellite television service provider in the second quarter of 2007 in connection with the change in our arrangement, as mentioned above. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $16.6 million impairment charge recorded in 2007 related to certain of our CLEC assets that were subsequently sold in 2008; (ii) a $4.4 million reduction in costs due to the six CLEC markets sold and (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in salaries and benefits. Cost of services and products increased $49.0 million (5.5%) in 2007 primarily due to (i) $52.5 million of costs incurred by our Madison River properties; (ii) a $20.9 million increase in DSL related expenses due to growth in the number of DSL customers; (iii) a $16.6 million impairment charge related to certain of our CLEC assets that were subsequently sold in 2008; and (iv) a $7.8 million increase in expenses associated with pole attachments primarily due to rate increases. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $33.1 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to one time costs associated with workforce reductions in 2006 and the impact of having fewer incumbent employees resulting from workforce reductions in 2007 and 2006 and (ii) a $19.7 million decrease in expenses associated with our satellite television service offering due to a change in our arrangement as mentioned above (such reduction includes a $4.1 million one time reimbursement of costs received from the service provider in 2007 in connection with the change in the arrangement, as described above). 57 Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9.6 million (2.5%) in 2008 primarily due to (i) an $11.4 million increase in marketing expenses; (ii) an $8.2 million increase due to expenses related to the curtailment loss associated with our SERP; (iii) $5.0 million of costs associated with our pending acquisition of EMBARQ (see Accounting Pronouncements below for additional information) and (iv) $4.8 million of additional costs incurred by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by (i) an $8.8 million decrease in operating taxes; (ii) a $5.4 million decrease in bad debt expense (most of which is attributable to a favorable settlement with a carrier in first quarter 2008); (iii) a $4.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits; and (iv) a $2.7 million decrease in information technology expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $19.3 million (5.2%) in 2007 primarily due to (i) $16.4 million of costs incurred by Madison River; (ii) an $8.2 million increase in salaries and benefits; and (iii) a $5.6 million increase in sales and marketing expenses. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $5.7 million reduction in bad debt expense and (ii) a $4.3 million decrease in information technology expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $12.5 million (2.3%) primarily due to a $36.7 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decrease was partially offset by $13.7 million of additional depreciation and amortization incurred by Madison River and a $12.8 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service. Depreciation and amortization increased $12.7 million (2.4%) in 2007 primarily due to $32.5 million of depreciation and amortization incurred by Madison River and a $14.8 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service. Such increases were substantially offset by a $31.7 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense decreased $10.7 million (5.0%) in 2008 compared to 2007. An $18.0 million decrease due to lower average interest rates was partially offset by a $9.3 million increase due to increased average debt outstanding. Interest expense increased $16.9 million (8.6%) in 2007 compared to 2006. A $22.7 million increase due to increased average debt outstanding (primarily due to the $750 million of senior notes issued in March 2007 to fund the Madison River acquisition) was partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease due to lower average interest rates. 58 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to our core operations, including gains or losses from nonoperating asset dispositions and impairments, our share of the income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during construction. Other income (expense) was $41.0 million in 2008, $38.8 million in 2007 and $121.6 million in 2006. The years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were impacted by certain charges and credits that are not expected to occur in the future. Included in 2008 income are (i) approximately $10 million related to the recognition of previously accrued transaction related and other contingencies, (ii) aggregate pre tax gains of approximately $7.3 million from the sales of certain non operating investments and (iii) a $4.5 million gain realized upon liquidation of our investments in marketable securities in our SERP trust. Also included in 2008 is a $3.4 million pre tax charge related to terminating certain derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting. The year 2007 includes a non recurring pre tax gain of $10.4 million related to the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership and a $5.2 million pre tax gain resulting from the final distribution of funds from the RTB redemption mentioned below. Included in 2006 were pre tax gains of approximately $118.6 million (substantially all of which related to the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB), which was partially offset by pre tax charges of approximately $11.7 million due to the impairment of certain non operating investments. Our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership decreased $2.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007. We record our share of the partnership income based on unaudited results of operations until the time we receive audited financial statements for the partnership from the unaffiliated general partner. Upon receipt of the respective audited financial statements, we recorded unfavorable adjustments in 2008 (upon completion of the 2007 audit) and favorable adjustments in 2007 (upon completion of the 2006 and 2005 audits). INCOME TAX EXPENSE The effective income tax rate was 34.7%, 32.4%, and 37.4% for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $12.8 million in 2008 and $32.7 million in 2007 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits (see Critical Accounting Policies below and Note 12). Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $1.7 million in 2008 and $6.4 million in 2006 due to the resolution of various income tax audit issues. 59 ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). Under SFAS 141(R), an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS 141(R) will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs, acquired contingent liabilities, restructuring costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. SFAS 141(R) is effective for us for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We will account for our pending acquisition of EMBARQ using the guidance of SFAS 141(R). Because it was probable that the acquisition date of the pending EMBARQ business combination would be subsequent to the January 1, 2009 effective date of SFAS 141(R), we elected to expense our EMBARQ acquisition related costs that had been incurred through December 31, 2008 in the fourth quarter of 2008 (which aggregated approximately $5.0 million). Such charge is reflected in selling, general and administrative expense in our 2008 consolidated statement of income. We will expense additional acquisition related costs as incurred after December 31, 2008. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157). SFAS 157, effective for us beginning January 1, 2008, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include: Level 1 (defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets); Level 2 (defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable); and Level 3 (defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists). See Note 17 for additional disclosures regarding SFAS 157. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests to be recognized as equity in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We do not expect SFAS 160 to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FSP EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. Based on this pronouncement, we have concluded that our outstanding non vested restricted stock is a participating security and therefore should be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two class method. The pronouncement is effective for us beginning in first quarter 2009 and, upon adoption, will require us to recast our previously reported earnings per share. If our diluted earnings per share would have been calculated using the provisions of FSP EITF 03 6 1 for 2008, our diluted earnings per share would have been $3.52 per share as compared to $3.56 per share. 60 In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements. FIN 48 required us, effective January 1, 2007, to recognize and measure tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclose uncertainties in income tax positions. See Note 12 for additional information related to our income tax uncertainties. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and be capitalized as part of the book value of the long lived asset. Although we generally have no legal obligation to remove obsolete assets, depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71), have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related estimated salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of SFAS 143, SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. For these reasons, the adoption of SFAS 143 did not have a material effect on our financial statements. For our telephone operations acquired from Verizon in 2002 (which are not subject to SFAS 71) and our other non regulated operations, we have not accrued a liability for anticipated removal costs related to tangible long lived assets. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) intangible and long lived assets, (v) business combinations and (vi) income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe these critical accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. Certain of our interstate network access and data revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the FCC; the remainder of such revenues is derived from revenue sharing arrangements with other LECs administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association, with the exception of DSL related revenues which were removed from our pooled interstate tariff filing effective July 1, 2006 and are now recognized as revenues when billed. We currently recognize such interstate network access revenues at the authorized rate of return, unless the actual achieved or projected rate of return is lower than authorized. 61 The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows local exchange carriers to file access tariffs on a streamlined basis and, if certain criteria are met, deems those tariffs lawful. Tariffs that have been deemed lawful in effect nullify an interexchange carriers ability to seek refunds should the earnings from the tariffs ultimately result in earnings above the authorized rate of return prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our telephone subsidiaries file interstate tariffs with the FCC using this streamlined filing approach. Since July 2004, we have recognized billings from our tariffs as revenue since we believe such tariffs are deemed lawful. There is no assurance that our future tariff filings will be deemed lawful. For those billings from tariffs prior to July 2004, we initially recorded as a deferred credit our earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we may need to increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pension and postretirement benefits. Accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee provides service to us. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of various assumptions, such as discount rates, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and inflation through a collaborative effort by management and independent actuaries. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgment and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements. Changes in assumptions used could result in a material impact to our financial results in any given period. 62 A significant assumption used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2008 and 2007, we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25%, which we believe reflects the expected long term rates of return in the financial markets based on our current plan asset allocation. We also reviewed the historical rates of return on those plan assets over long term periods that ranged from 10 to 20 years. A 25 basis point decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase annual combined pension and postretirement expense approximately $870,000. During 2008, the loss on our pension plan assets was approximately 28%, which was significantly lower than our 8.25% expected return assumption. The effect of this large difference between actual and expected asset returns for 2008 has negatively impacted us in several ways, including (i) contributing largely to the $80.8 million after tax increase in our accumulated other comprehensive loss (which reduced our consolidated stockholders equity balance as of December 31, 2008); (ii) an expected increase in our pension expense for 2009 compared to 2008 estimated to be approximately $20 million; and (iii) anticipated higher contributions to our pension plans in the near future than previously expected. We contributed $50 million to our primary pension plan in late 2008. Since our previous contributions to our primary pension plan have exceeded the minimum amount of contributions required by law, we have accumulated a positive credit balance under the plan. We currently estimate that our existing accumulated credit balance will be sufficient to fully satisfy our required minimum contribution under the plan for 2009 and partially satisfy our 2010 required minimum contribution. Based on actuarial estimates as of December 31, 2008 that assume the utilization of our existing credit balance to satisfy future cash contributions and assuming no discretionary contributions are made, our required minimum contribution to our primary pension plan is estimated to be $4 million in 2010 and $30 million in 2011. Our minimum required contributions to our other pension plans are immaterial. Another assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is an assumed rate of return derived from high quality debt securities that, if applicable at the measurement date to a specified amount of principal, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay our pension benefit obligations when they become due. For our pension plans, the discount rate used for the December 31, 2008 measurement date was derived by matching projected benefit payments to bond yields obtained from the CitiGroup Pension Discount Curve (Above Median) which are ultimately derived from the AA rated corporate bond sector. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we utilized the CitiGroup Pension Discount Curve to derive our discount rate. Our discount rate for determining benefit obligations under our primary pension plan at December 31, 2008 was 6.6% compared to 6.3% at December 31, 2007. The utilization of a different methodology to derive the discount rate is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes. Such change (i) had no impact to the amount of pension expense recognized in 2008, (ii) will have an immaterial impact to the amount of pension expense recognized in 2009 and (iii) reduced our projected benefit obligation by approximately $26 million as of December 31, 2008. The discount rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. We use a similar methodology to determine the discount rate for our postretirement plan by utilizing as a reference the Hewitt Top Quartile Yield Curve as of the end of the year. Our discount rate for determining benefit obligations under our postretirement plan at December 31, 2008 was 6.9% compared to 6.5% at December 31, 2007. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual combined pension and postretirement expense approximately $1.4 million. Intangible and long lived assets. We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets under two accounting standards, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142), and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). 63 SFAS 142 requires goodwill recorded in business combinations to be reviewed for impairment at least annually and requires write downs only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. The vast majority of our goodwill is attributable to our telephone operations, which we internally operate and manage based on three geographic regions. We test for goodwill impairment for our telephone operations at the region level due to the similar economic characteristics of the individual reporting units that comprise each region. Under SFAS 142, impairment of goodwill is tested by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including goodwill). Estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit of our telephone operations are based on valuation models using techniques such as multiples of earnings (before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization). We also evaluate goodwill impairment of our other operations primarily based on multiples of revenues and discounted cash flow analyses. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. We completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2008) under SFAS 142 and determined our goodwill was not impaired as of such date. Due to the deterioration in the overall stock market subsequent to September 30, 2008, our market capitalization as of December 31, 2008 decreased to a level below our current stockholders equity balance. As a result, we reviewed the specific factors outlined in SFAS 142 that would indicate whether or not a triggering event had occurred that would necessitate us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on our review of such factors and considering that our market capitalization substantially exceeds our stockholders equity balance after consideration of a reasonable control premium of 35% based on identified industry transactions, we concluded that we did not have a triggering event that would require us to perform an interim evaluation of our goodwill for potential impairment. We based such conclusion on the fact that we do not believe there have been any significant fundamental changes since our annual impairment test to (i) our business as a whole or our reporting units, including regulatory changes, (ii) our level of operating cash flows, (iii) our expectation of future levels of operating cash flows, (iv) our executive management team and (v) the carrying value of our other long lived assets. Under SFAS 144, the carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. We recognized a $16.6 million pre tax impairment charge in 2007 related to certain of our CLEC assets that were subsequently sold in 2008. 64 Business combinations. As described above, SFAS 141(R) is effective for us for all business combinations consummated on or after January 1, 2009 and requires an acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. We have concluded that we are the accounting acquirer in our pending acquisition of EMBARQ, which we expect to complete in the second quarter of 2009. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of EMBARQ (and the related estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets) will require a significant amount of judgment and will be considered a critical estimate. Such allocation of the purchase price will be performed by an independent valuation firm. For additional information concerning this pending acquisition, see Item 1 of Part I of this annual report. Income taxes. We estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in our tax returns. These liabilities are estimated based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances. Changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of change. During 2008 and 2007, we recognized approximately $12.8 million and $32.7 million, respectively, of previously unrecognized tax benefits (including related interest and net of federal tax benefit) in accordance with FIN 48. Such benefits were recorded primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of audits, administrative practices and the lapse of statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions. See Note 12 for additional information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits. For additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters below, and the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. INFLATION Historically, we have mitigated the effects of increased costs by recovering over time certain costs applicable to our regulated telephone operations through the rate making process. However, LECs operating over 72% of our total access lines are now governed by state alternative regulation plans, some of which restrict or delay our ability to recover increased costs. Additional future regulatory changes and competitive situations may further alter our ability to recover increased costs in our regulated operations. For our properties acquired from Verizon in 2002, which are regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, price changes for certain revenue components are limited to the rate of inflation. As operating expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover the costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment. 65 MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. Fair value of long term debt obligations is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be $2.7 billion based on the overall weighted average rate of our long term debt of 6.2% and an overall weighted maturity of 7 years compared to terms and rates available on such date in long term financing markets. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 62 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $66.5 million decrease in the fair value of our long term debt. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 83% of our long term debt obligations were fixed rate. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time over the past several years, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. In January 2008, we terminated all of our existing fixed to variable interest rate swaps associated with the full $500 million principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due 2012. In connection with the termination of these derivatives, we received aggregate cash payments of approximately $25.6 million, which has been reflected as a premium of the associated long term debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense through 2012 using the effective interest method. In addition, in January 2008, we also terminated certain other derivatives that were not deemed to be effective hedges. Upon the termination of these derivatives, we paid an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million (and recorded a $3.4 million pre tax charge in the first quarter of 2008 related to the settlement of these derivatives). As of December 31, 2008, we had no derivative instruments outstanding. We are also exposed to market risk from changes in the fair value of our pension plan assets. For 2008, the loss on our pension plan assets was approximately 28%. Should our actual return on plan assets continue to be significantly lower than our 8.25% expected return assumption, our net periodic pension expense will increase in future periods and we will be required to contribute additional funds to our pension plan after 2009. See Critical Accounting Policies above for additional information. 66 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair value calculations. The analysis above incorporates only those risk exposures that existed as of December 31, 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to provide for our cash needs. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long term program of capital improvements. The recent disruption in the credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and other companies. To date, our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will materially impact us in the near future. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the overall credit markets. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $853.3 million, $1.0 billion and $840.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Payments for income taxes aggregated $208.8 million, $185.3 million and $212.4 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We also made contributions to our pension plans that aggregated approximately $52.5 million in 2008, $1.5 million in 2007 and $31.5 million in 2006. Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of those years. For additional information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $389.0 million, $619.2 million and $193.7 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We used $306.8 million of cash (net of approximately $20.0 million of acquired cash) to purchase Madison River Communications Corp. (Madison River) and pay related closing costs on April 30, 2007 (see below and Note 2 for additional information). We received approximately $122.8 million cash from the redemption of our RTB stock upon dissolution of the RTB during 2006. See Note 15 for additional information. Capital expenditures during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $286.8 million, $326.0 million and $314.1 million, respectively. 67 During 2008, we paid an aggregate of approximately $149 million for 69 licenses in the FCCs auction of 700 megahertz (MHz) wireless spectrum. The 700 MHz spectrum is not expected to be cleared for usage until mid 2009. We are still in the planning stages regarding the use of this spectrum. However, based on our preliminary analysis, we are considering developing wireless voice and data service capabilities based on equipment using LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology. Given that this equipment is not expected to be commercially available until 2010, we do not expect our deployment to result in any material impact on our capital and operating budgets in 2009. In anticipation of making lump sum distributions to certain participants of our SERP in early 2009, we liquidated our investments in marketable securities in the SERP trust during the second quarter of 2008 and thereby increased our cash and cash equivalents by $34.9 million. The lump sum distributions were paid in early 2009 and aggregated approximately $37 million. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $255.4 million in 2008, $402.1 million in 2007 and $780.2 million in 2006. In the first quarter of 2008, we paid our $240 million Series F Senior Notes at maturity using borrowings from our credit facility. In late March 2007, we publicly issued an aggregate of $750 million of Senior Notes (see Note 5 for additional information). The net proceeds from the issuance of such Senior Notes aggregated approximately $741.8 million and were used (along with cash on hand and approximately $50 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program) to (i) finance the initial purchase price for the April 30, 2007 acquisition of Madison River ($322 million) and (ii) pay off Madison Rivers existing indebtedness (including accrued interest) at closing ($522 million). Payments of debt were $285.4 million in 2008, $713.0 million in 2007 and $82.0 million in 2006. As previously mentioned, because of concerns with the overall state of the credit markets, we increased our cash position at the end of 2008 by borrowing funds under our credit facility to insure we had sufficient cash to fulfill our near term cash requirements. See below for additional information regarding our credit facility. As discussed in Note 1, we have entered into a definitive agreement to merge with Embarq Corporation. Assuming we timely receive all regulatory approvals (and all other closing conditions are met), we hope to consummate the merger in the second quarter of 2009. In connection with the closing, we intend to finance our merger transaction expenses with (i) available cash of the combined company and (ii) proceeds from CenturyTels or EMBARQs existing revolving credit facilities. As previously announced, EMBARQ amended its credit facility in January 2009 to enable the facility to remain in place as an $800 million unsecured revolving credit facility after the completion of the pending merger through May 2011. The amendment will take effect only upon the completion of the merger and the satisfaction of certain other conditions specified in the amendment. For Note 20 for additional information. 68 In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 9.7 million shares (for $347.3 million), 10.2 million shares (for $460.7 million), and 21.4 million shares (for $802.2 million) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2006 repurchases include 14.36 million shares repurchased (for an aggregate final adjusted price of approximately $528.4 million) under accelerated share repurchase agreements with investment banks (see Note 9 for additional information). We have suspended our current share repurchase program pending completion of our acquisition of EMBARQ. In June 2008, our Board of Directors determined to (i) increase our annual cash dividend to $2.80 from $.27 per share and (ii) declare a one time dividend of $.6325 per share, which was paid in July 2008, effectively adjusting the total second quarter dividend to the new $.70 quarterly dividend rate. We plan to continue our current dividend practice through the consummation of the EMBARQ merger. Following the closing of the EMBARQ merger, we expect to continue our current dividend practice and resume share repurchases, subject to our intention to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt. In the first quarter of 2008, we received a net cash settlement of approximately $20.7 million from the termination of all of our existing derivative instruments. See Market Risk for additional information concerning the termination of these derivatives. As described further in Note 5, we called for redemption on August 14, 2007, all of our $165 million aggregate principal amount of Series K convertible senior debentures, subject to the right of holders to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $40.455. In lieu of cash redemption, holders of approximately $149.6 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 3.7 million shares of CenturyTel common stock. The remaining $15.4 million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash (including premium and accrued and unpaid interest). Other. For 2009, we have budgeted between $280 300 million for capital expenditures, excluding nonrecurring capital expenditures expected to arise out of our pending EMBARQ acquisition. A few years ago, we concluded that our prior extensive capital investment in our wireline network permitted us to reduce wireline network capital spending to maintenance levels. Our 2009 capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and expanding our data networks. 69 The following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. Payments due by period After Contractual obligations Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2013 and Other (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 3,314,526 20,407 1,098,921 775,759 1,419,439 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 1,345,267 191,326 316,128 215,950 621,863 Unrecognized tax benefits (2) 17,285 17,285 (1) For additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay assuming we are required to pay the entire amount that we have reserved for our unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 12 for additional information). The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the After 2013 and Other column in the above table. We continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expect to continue our long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractively priced communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf registration statement. We also have access to debt and equity capital markets. We have available a five year, $708 million revolving credit facility which expires in December 2011. The credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to meet a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) not exceeding 4 to 1 and a minimum interest coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.5 to 1. The interest rate on revolving loans under the facility is based on our choice of several prevailing commercial lending rates plus an additional margin that varies depending on our credit ratings and aggregate borrowings under the facility. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unutilized portion of the facility, the amount of which varies based on our credit ratings. Up to $150 million of the credit facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Available borrowings under our credit facility are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program borrowings in turn are effectively limited to the total amount available under our credit facility. As of December 31, 2008, we had $563 million outstanding under our credit facility. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2008. 70 Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), which currently rates our debt Baa2, indicated our debt rating is currently under review for a possible downgrade to Baa3. Standard & Poors (S&P) rates our long term debt BBB (with a stable outlook). Our commercial paper program is rated P2 by Moodys and A3 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our $708 million revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing our financial or operating flexibility. The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Our debt to capitalization ratio has increased primarily due to share repurchases we have made during the last few years. 2008 2007 2006 Debt to total capitalization 51.2 % 46.9 44.8 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.74 3.85 3.94 * For purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend costs. 71 REGULATION AND COMPETITION The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services. As a result, some customers have chosen to completely forego use of traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service for voice services. This trend is more pronounced among residential customers, which comprise 73% of our access line customers. We anticipate this trend will continue, particularly if wireless service providers continue to expand their coverage areas, reduce their rates, improve the quality of their services, and offer enhanced new services. In 1996, the United States Congress enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), which obligates LECs to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the LECs network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition. Under the 1996 Acts rural telephone company exemption, approximately half of our telephone access lines are exempt from certain of these interconnection requirements unless and until the appropriate state regulatory commission overrides the exemption upon receipt from a competitor of a bona fide request meeting certain criteria. Federal USF programs have undergone substantial changes since 1997, and are expected to experience more changes in the coming years as modernization of the overall program moves forward. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five year period based on embedded, or historical, costs that provide relatively predictable levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs. In May 2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism until such time that new high cost support rules are adopted for rural telephone companies. Wireless and other competitive service providers continue to seek to qualify to receive USF support. This trend, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on disbursements. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including support payments we receive from the USF High Cost Loop support program. Increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all USF recipients caused our revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program to decrease approximately $14.6 million in 2008 when compared to 2007. We anticipate that our 2009 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop support program will be lower than 2008 by approximately $12 14 million. 72 Since May 2007, the FCC and the Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service have each proposed a series of reforms that could, if adopted, substantially restructure current USF programs, including comprehensive reform proposals released for public comment in November 2008. Until the FCC acts on those recommendations or issues final rules, we cannot estimate the impact that such proposals would have on our operations. In addition, there are a number of judicial appeals challenging several aspects of the FCCs universal service rules and various Congressional proposals seeking to substantially modify USF programs, none of which have been resolved at this time. We will continue to be active in monitoring these developments. Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Additionally, several large electric utilities have announced plans to offer communications services that compete with LECs. Improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate, all distance calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs and may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services. In late 2003, the FCC initiated rulemaking proceedings to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted orders establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers. In 2003, the FCC opened a broad intercarrier compensation proceeding with the ultimate goal of creating a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, carrying or delivering telecommunications traffic. The FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and industry negotiations are continuing with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry segments. In late 2008, the FCC issued a document that, among other things, requested public comment on the chairmans draft proposal which would require carriers to reduce access charges to a rate that was significantly lower than what we currently charge. It is currently unclear when the FCC may take action with respect to the draft proposals. Adoption of the chairmans original proposal, which is included in the latest draft order, could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Until the FCCs proceeding concludes and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact this proceeding will have on our results of operations. 73 Many cable, technology or other communication companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Several of these companies started offering full service bundles before us, which could give them an advantage in building customer loyalty. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for our access lines. Recent events affecting us. During the last few years, all of the states in which we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent years, especially in the markets we acquired from Verizon in 2002 and 2000, and it is anticipated that similar action may be taken by others in the future. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our LECs reduce intrastate access tariffed rates. In addition, we have recently experienced reductions in intrastate traffic, partially due to the displacement of minutes by wireless, electronic mail and other optional calling services. In 2008 we incurred a reduction in our intrastate revenues of approximately $29.0 million compared to 2007 primarily due to these factors. The corresponding decrease in 2007 compared to 2006 was $20.9 million. We believe this trend of decreased intrastate minutes will continue in 2009, although the magnitude of such decrease is uncertain. Over the past several years, each of the Federal Communications Commission, Universal Service Administrative Company and certain Congressional committees has initiated wide ranging reviews of the administration of the federal USF program. As part of this process, we, along with a number of other USF recipients, have undergone a number of USF audits and have also received requests for information from the FCCs Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Congressional committees. In addition, in July 2008 we received a subpoena from the OIG requesting a broad range of information regarding our depreciation rates and methodologies since 2000. The OIG has not identified to us any specific issues with respect to our participation in the USF program and none of the audits completed to date has identified any material issues regarding our participation in the USF program. While we believe our participation is in compliance with FCC rules and in accordance with accepted industry practices, we cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of these various reviews. We have complied with and are continuing to respond to all requests for information. Exclusive of acquisitions, we expect our operating revenues in 2009 to decline as we continue to experience downward pressure primarily due to continued access line losses, reduced universal service funding and lower network access revenues. We expect such declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand for our high speed Internet service offering. For a more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual report. 74 Other matters. We currently account for our regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation (SFAS 71). Actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities are required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to SFAS 71. We continuously monitor the ongoing applicability of SFAS 71 to our regulated telephone operations due to the changing regulatory, competitive and legislative environments, and it is possible that changes in regulation, legislation or competition or in the demand for regulated services or products could result in our telephone operations no longer being subject to SFAS 71 in the near future. As of December 31, 2008, we believe that SFAS 71 still applies. In September 2008, we filed a petition with the FCC to convert our remaining rate of return study areas to price cap regulation effective January 1, 2009 and, to the extent necessary, requested limited waivers of certain pricing and universal service high cost support rules related to our election. Such petition was not addressed by the FCC in 2008 and remains pending. Should the petition be approved by the FCC, we believe this would require us to discontinue the accounting requirements of SFAS 71 as of the effective date of the conversion to price cap regulation. In that event, implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 101 ("SFAS 101"), "Regulated Enterprises Accounting for the Discontinuance of Application of FASB Statement No. 71," would require the write off of previously established regulatory assets and liabilities. Depreciation rates of certain assets established by regulatory authorities for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71 have historically included a component for removal costs in excess of the related salvage value. Notwithstanding the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), SFAS 71 requires us to continue to reflect this accumulated liability for removal costs in excess of salvage value even though there is no legal obligation to remove the assets. Therefore, we did not adopt the provisions of SFAS 143 for our telephone operations subject to SFAS 71. SFAS 101 further provides that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are to be adjusted only to the extent the assets are impaired and that impairment shall be judged in the same manner as for nonregulated enterprises. Our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 included regulatory liabilities of approximately $216.5 million related to estimated removal costs embedded in accumulated depreciation (as described above). Upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, such amount (on an after tax basis) will be reflected as an extraordinary gain on our consolidated statement of income for the period in which the discontinuance takes effect. When our regulated operations cease to qualify for the application of SFAS 71, we do not expect to record an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment of our regulated telephone operations. Additionally, upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we would be required to revise the lives of our property, plant and equipment to reflect the estimated useful lives of the assets. We do not expect such revisions in asset lives, or the elimination of other regulatory assets and liabilities, to have a material unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Upon the discontinuance of SFAS 71, we also would be required to eliminate certain intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that currently are not eliminated under the application of SFAS 71. For 2008, approximately $197 million of revenues (and related costs) would have been eliminated had we not been subject to the provisions of SFAS 71. For regulatory purposes, the accounting and reporting of our telephone subsidiaries would not be affected by the discontinued application of SFAS 71. 75 If the FCC adopts new rules on intercarrier compensation, we may withdraw our petition for price cap regulation. If we have not discontinued the accounting requirements of SFAS 71 prior to the effective date of the acquisition of EMBARQ, we believe the consummation of this acquisition would require us to discontinue the application of SFAS 71 effective as of the closing date. We have certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2008 have not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
