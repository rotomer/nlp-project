Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations All references to Notes in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. OVERVIEW On July 1, 2009, we acquired Embarq Corporation (Embarq) in a transaction that substantially expanded the size and scope of our business. The results of operations of Embarq are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning July 1, 2009. Due to the significant size of Embarq, direct comparisons of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 with prior periods are less meaningful than usual. We discuss below certain trends that we believe are significant, even if they are not necessarily material to the combined company. Subsequent to the Embarq acquisition, we are now an integrated communications company primarily engaged in providing an array of communications services to customers in 33 states, including local and long distance voice, wholesale network access, high speed Internet access, other data services, and video services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier, security monitoring, and other communications, professional and business information services. We operate approximately 7.0 million access lines and serve approximately 2.2 million broadband customers, based on operating data as of December 31, 2009. For additional information on our revenue sources, see Note 19. For additional information on our acquisition of Embarq, see Note 2. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred a significant amount of one time expenses, the vast majority of which are directly attributable to our acquisition of Embarq. Such expenses are summarized in the table below. Year ended Description December 31, 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Severance and retention costs due to workforce reductions, including contractual early retirement pension benefits for certain participants $ 98,922 Integration related costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq 86,371 Net charge associated with certain debt extinguishments 60,849 Transaction related costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq, including investment banker and legal fees 47,154 Accelerated recognition of share based compensation expense due to change of control provisions and terminations of employment 21,244 Settlement expenses related to certain executive retirement plans 17,834 Charge incurred in connection with our $800 million bridge facility 8,000 $ 340,374 50 All of the above items are included in operating expenses, except for the $60.8 million net charge incurred associated with certain debt extinguishments (which is reflected in other income (expense) and interest expense) and the $8.0 million charge incurred in connection with our $800 million bridge facility (which is reflected in other income (expense)). None of the above items include pre closing expenses incurred and recorded by Embarq prior to the effective time of the acquisition. Based on current plans and information, we expect to incur approximately $200 million of additional non recurring integration related operating expenses subsequent to December 31, 2009. In addition, due to executive compensation limitations pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of the lump sum distributions related to the termination of an executive retirement plan made in the first quarter of 2009 is reflected as non deductible for income tax purposes and thus increased our effective income tax rate. Certain merger related costs incurred during 2009 are also non deductible for income tax purposes and similarly increased our effective income tax rate. Such increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by a $7.0 million reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, in 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized net after tax benefits of approximately $15.7 million, $12.8 million and $32.7 million, respectively, primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 12 and Income Tax Expense below for additional information. Upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009, we recorded a one time, non cash extraordinary gain that aggregated approximately $218.6 million before income tax expense and noncontrolling interests ($136.0 million after tax and noncontrolling interests). See Note 15 for additional information. As further discussed in Note 11, during the second quarter of 2008, we recognized an $8.2 million curtailment loss (reflected in selling, general and administrative expense) in connection with amending our executive retirement plan. We also recognized a $4.5 million pre tax gain (reflected in other income (expense)) upon liquidation of our investments in marketable securities in the executive retirement plan trust in the second quarter of 2008. On April 30, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Madison River Communications Corp. (Madison River). See Note 2 for additional information. We have reflected the results of operations of the Madison River properties in our consolidated results of operations since May 1, 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a $16.6 million pre tax impairment charge to write down the value of certain long lived assets in six of our northern competitive local exchange carrier markets to their estimated realizable value. We determined the estimated realizable value based on proposals received during our sales process of such properties commenced in 2007. We sold such properties in separate transactions in May and July 2008. Results of operations for these markets are included in our consolidated results of operations up to the respective sales dates. 51 During 2007, we recognized approximately $49.0 million of network access revenues in connection with the settlement of a dispute with a carrier and approximately $42.2 million of revenues in connection with the lapse of a regulatory monitoring period (of which approximately $25.4 million is reflected in network access revenues and $16.8 million is reflected in data revenues). We do not expect this level of favorable revenue settlements to reoccur in the future. In the fourth quarter of 2007, upon final distribution of the remaining proceeds from the Rural Telephone Bank dissolution, we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately $5.2 million. During the last several years (exclusive of acquisitions and certain non recurring favorable adjustments), we have experienced revenue declines in our voice and network access revenues primarily due to declines in access lines, intrastate access rates, minutes of use, and federal support fund payments. To mitigate these declines, we plan to, among other things, (i) promote long term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services, (ii) provide new services, such as video and wireless broadband, and other additional services that may become available in the future due to advances in technology, wireless spectrum sales by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or improvements in our infrastructure, (iii) provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers, (iv) pursue acquisitions of additional communications properties if available at attractive prices, (v) increase usage of our networks and (vi) market our products and services to new customers. In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry (including those arising out of the FCCs proposed rules regarding intercarrier compensation and the Universal Service Fund and the FCCs National Broadband Plan scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2010, each as described elsewhere herein); our ability to effectively adjust to changes in the communications industry; our ability to successfully integrate Embarq into our operations, including realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction and retaining and hiring key personnel; our ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; our continued access to credit markets on favorable terms; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; our ability to pay a $2.90 per common share dividend annually, which may be affected by changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position; unanticipated increases in our capital expenditures; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; 52 the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business and our acquisition of Embarq are described in greater detail in Item 1A included herein. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward looking statements for any reason. 53 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income attributable to CenturyTel, Inc. for 2009 was $647.2 million, compared to $365.7 million during 2008 and $418.4 million during 2007. Net income before extraordinary item was $511.3 million, $365.7 million and $418.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for 2009 was $3.23 compared to $3.52 in 2008 and $3.71 in 2007. Diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item for 2009 was $2.55. As mentioned in the Overview section above, we incurred a significant amount of one time expenses in 2009 related to our acquisition of Embarq. The increase in the number of shares outstanding in 2009 is primarily attributable to the common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009. The number of average diluted shares outstanding declined in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to share repurchases. Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 1,233,101 721,352 793,078 Interest expense (370,414 ) (202,217 ) (212,906 ) Other income (expense) (48,175 ) 42,252 40,029 Income tax expense (301,881 ) (194,357 ) (200,572 ) Income before noncontrolling interests and extraordinary item 512,631 367,030 419,629 Noncontrolling interests (1,377 ) (1,298 ) (1,259 ) Net income before extraordinary item 511,254 365,732 418,370 Extraordinary item, net of income tax expense and noncontrolling interests 135,957 Net income attributable to CenturyTel, Inc. $ 647,211 365,732 418,370 Basic earnings per share Before extraordinary item $ 2.55 3.53 3.79 Extraordinary item $ .68 Basic earnings per share $ 3.23 3.53 3.79 Diluted earnings per share Before extraordinary item $ 2.55 3.52 3.71 Extraordinary item $ .68 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.23 3.52 3.71 Average basic shares outstanding 198,813 102,268 109,360 Average diluted shares outstanding 199,057 102,560 112,787 Operating income increased $511.7 million in 2009 due to a $2.374 billion increase in operating revenues and a $1.863 billion increase in operating expenses. Such increases in operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income were substantially due to our July 1, 2009 acquisition of Embarq. Operating income decreased $71.7 million in 2008 due to a $56.5 million decrease in operating revenues and a $15.2 million increase in operating expenses. 54 As mentioned in Note 15, we discontinued the application of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009. As a result of such discontinuance, since the third quarter of 2009 we have eliminated all intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that previously were not eliminated under the application of regulatory accounting. This has caused our revenues and operating expenses to be lower by equivalent amounts (approximately $108 million) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Voice $ 1,827,063 874,041 889,960 Network access 1,269,322 820,383 941,506 Data 1,202,284 524,194 460,755 Fiber transport and CLEC 172,541 162,050 159,317 Other 503,029 219,079 204,703 Operating revenues $ 4,974,239 2,599,747 2,656,241 Voice revenues. We derive voice revenues by providing local exchange telephone services and retail long distance services to customers in our service areas. The $953.0 million increase in voice revenues in 2009 is primarily due to $1.016 billion of revenues attributable to the Embarq properties acquired July 1, 2009. The remaining $63.2 million decrease is primarily due to (i) a $30.9 million decrease due to a 6.6% decline in the average number of access lines in our incumbent markets; (ii) a $14.5 million decrease in custom calling feature revenues primarily due to the continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at a lower effective rate and (iii) an $8.1 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. The $15.9 million (1.8%) decrease in voice revenues in 2008 is primarily due to (i) a $22.5 million decrease due to a 5.9% decline in the average number of access lines (exclusive of our acquisition of Madison River properties); (ii) a $10.8 million decrease in custom calling feature revenues primarily due to the continued migration to bundled service offerings at a lower effective rate; and (iii) a $7.7 million decline as a result of a decrease in revenues associated with extended area calling plans. These decreases were partially offset by $17.0 million of additional revenues attributable to the Madison River properties acquired April 30, 2007 and a $9.9 million increase in long distance revenues attributable to an increase in the percentage of our customer base subscribing to fixed rate unlimited calling plans and the implementation of rate increases applicable to several rate plans in late 2007 and early 2008. 55 Total access lines declined 380,000 during 2009 (excluding access lines we acquired from Embarq on July 1, 2009 but including access lines lost in Embarqs markets following such acquisition) compared to a decline of 136,800 during 2008. We believe the decline in the number of access lines during 2009 and 2008 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services and recent economic conditions. Based on our current retention initiatives, we estimate that our access line loss will be between 7.5% and 8.5% in 2010. Network access revenues. We derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions; (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms and (iii) receiving reciprocal compensation from competitive local exchange carriers and wireless service providers for terminating their calls. Substantially all of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges filed directly with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Certain of our intrastate network access revenues are derived through access charges that we bill to intrastate long distance carriers and other LEC customers. Network access revenues increased $448.9 million (54.7%) in 2009 and decreased $121.1 million (12.9%) in 2008 due to the following factors: 2009 2008 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Acquisition of Embarq in 2009 $ 530,969 Favorable settlement of a dispute with a carrier in 2007 (48,987 ) Intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use, decreased access rates in certain states and recoveries from state support funds (35,501 ) (29,022 ) Elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting (26,031 ) Revenue recognition upon expiration of regulatory monitoring periods in 2007 (25,402 ) Partial recovery of operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return on rate base (17,052 ) (15,857 ) Recovery from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program (12,964 ) (14,596 ) Acquisition of Madison River in 2007 12,345 Prior year revenue settlement agreements and other 9,518 396 $ 448,939 (121,123 ) 56 We believe that intrastate access rates and minutes will continue to decline in 2010, although we cannot precisely estimate the magnitude of such decrease. Complaints filed by interexchange carriers in several of our operating states or state initiated legislation could, if successful, place further downward pressure on our intrastate access rates. As mentioned above, upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009, we began eliminating all intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that previously were not eliminated under the application of regulatory accounting. We currently expect our network access revenues to continue to be negatively impacted in 2010 by a reduction in Universal Service Fund receipts. In addition, a wireless carrier has notified us of its intention to migrate a portion of its network traffic from us in 2010. We currently estimate these items, along with the transition of long distance voice services from a wholesale arrangement with another carrier to our owned networks, will reduce network access revenues approximately $120 130 million in 2010 as compared to the annual run rate for the last half of 2009. In March 2006, we filed a complaint against a carrier for recovery of unpaid and underpaid access charges for calls made using the carriers prepaid calling cards and calls that used Internet Protocol for a portion of their transmission. In April 2007, we entered into a settlement agreement with the carrier and received approximately $49 million cash from them related to the issues described above. Data revenues. We derive our data revenues primarily by providing high speed Internet access services and data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues increased $678.1 million in 2009 due to $689.8 million of revenues attributable to Embarq. Excluding Embarq, data revenues decreased $11.7 million substantially due to a $51.4 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. Such decrease was partially offset by a $38.5 million increase in DSL related revenues primarily due to growth in the number of DSL customers in our incumbent markets. Data revenues increased $63.4 million (13.8%) in 2008 substantially due to (i) a $57.8 million increase in DSL related revenues primarily due to growth in the number of DSL customers and (ii) $16.3 million of additional revenues contributed by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by $16.8 million of one time revenues recorded in third quarter 2007 upon expiration of a regulatory monitoring period. Fiber transport and CLEC. Our fiber transport and CLEC revenues include revenues from our fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) and security monitoring businesses. Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $10.5 million in 2009 primarily due to $8.3 million of revenues attributable to Embarq and a $6.8 million increase in fiber transport revenues. Such increases were partially offset by a $4.5 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting beginning in the third quarter of 2009. 57 Fiber transport and CLEC revenues increased $2.7 million (1.7%) in 2008, of which $6.4 million was due to growth in our incumbent fiber transport business and $2.5 million was due to additional revenue contributed by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by a $2.6 million decrease due to the sales of six CLEC markets that were consummated in the second and third quarters of 2008 and a $3.5 million decrease in CLEC revenues primarily due to the loss of customers. Other revenues. We derive other revenues primarily by (i) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring; (ii) providing payphone services primarily within our local service territories and various correctional facilities around the country; (iii) participating in the publication of local directories; (iv) providing network database services; and (iv) providing our video services, as well as other new product and service offerings. Other revenues increased $284.0 million in 2009, of which approximately $318.1 million related to our acquisition of Embarq. Excluding Embarq, other revenues decreased $34.2 million primarily as a result of a $17.4 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a $10.5 million decrease in certain non regulated product sales and service offerings. Other revenues increased $14.4 million (7.0%) in 2008 primarily due to (i) $7.7 million of additional revenues contributed by Madison River and (ii) a $2.8 million increase in directory revenues. OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 1,752,087 955,473 937,375 Selling, general and administrative 1,014,341 399,136 389,533 Depreciation and amortization 974,710 523,786 536,255 Operating expenses $ 3,741,138 1,878,395 1,863,163 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $796.6 million (83.4%) in 2009 primarily due to $888.8 million of expenses attributable to the Embarq properties acquired on July 1, 2009. The remaining $92.2 million decrease is primarily due to (i) a $88.7 million reduction in expenses resulting from the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting; (ii) a $4.9 million decrease in customer service related expenses; (iii) a $4.6 million decrease in access expense; and (iv) a $4.1 million decrease in CLEC expenses as a result of the divestiture of six CLEC markets in 2008. Such decreases were partially offset by a $15.8 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily due to increases in pension expense and share based compensation expense and a $12.4 million increase in DSL related expenses due to an increase in the number of DSL customers served. 58 Cost of services and products increased $18.1 million (1.9%) in 2008 primarily due to (i) $22.7 million of additional costs incurred by the Madison River properties; (ii) a $12.3 million increase in DSL related expenses due to growth in the number of DSL customers; (iii) a $4.9 million increase in costs associated with initiating switched digital video services; and (iv) a $4.1 million increase due to a one time reimbursement of costs received from our satellite television service provider in the second quarter of 2007 in connection with the change in our contractual arrangement. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $16.6 million impairment charge recorded in 2007 related to certain of our CLEC assets that were subsequently sold in 2008; (ii) a $4.4 million reduction in costs due to the six CLEC markets sold; and (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in salaries and benefits. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $615.2 million in 2009 primarily due to $500.6 million of expenses attributable to Embarq (which includes approximately $106.0 million of costs associated with employee termination benefits, primarily due to severance and retention benefits, contractual pension benefits and acceleration of share based compensation expense associated with Embarq employee terminations). The remaining $114.6 million increase is primarily due to (i) $86.4 million of integration costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq, primarily related to system conversion efforts; (ii) $47.2 million of transaction related merger costs, including investment banker and legal fees associated with our acquisition of Embarq; and (iii) $13.8 million of higher employee benefit costs, primarily due to higher pension expense (primarily due to $17.8 million of accelerated expense recognition due to change of control provisions triggered upon our acquisition of Embarq and the termination of a supplemental executive retirement plan) and share based compensation expense (due to the accelerated vesting of equity grants of our employees upon the acquisition of Embarq). Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $19.5 million reduction in expenses resulting from the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting; (ii) a $10.7 million reduction in operating taxes primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain transaction tax audit issues; and (iii) an $8.1 million reduction in marketing expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $9.6 million (2.5%) in 2008 primarily due to (i) an $11.4 million increase in marketing expenses; (ii) an $8.2 million increase due to expenses related to the curtailment loss associated with our SERP; (iii) $5.0 million of costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq; and (iv) $4.8 million of additional costs incurred by Madison River. Such increases were partially offset by (i) an $8.8 million decrease in operating taxes; (ii) a $5.4 million decrease in bad debt expense (most of which was attributable to a favorable settlement with a carrier in first quarter 2008); (iii) a $4.3 million decrease in salaries and benefits; and (iv) a $2.7 million decrease in information technology expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $450.9 million (86.1%) in 2009 primarily due to $492.6 million of depreciation and amortization attributable to Embarq (including $118.4 million of amortization expense related to its customer list and other intangible assets). The remaining $41.7 million decrease was primarily due to a $59.8 million decrease in depreciation expense resulting from a reduction in certain depreciation rates effective July 1, 2009 upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting (see Note 15) and due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by an $18.8 million increase due to higher levels of plant placed in service in our incumbent markets. 59 Depreciation and amortization decreased $12.5 million (2.3%) in 2008 primarily due to a $36.7 million reduction in depreciation expense due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decrease was partially offset by $13.7 million of additional depreciation and amortization incurred by Madison River and a $12.8 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service. Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased $168.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to $179.9 million of interest expense attributable to Embarqs indebtedness assumed in connection with our acquisition of Embarq. The remaining $11.7 million decrease is primarily attributable to a $4.6 million decrease in interest expense due to favorable resolution of certain transaction tax audit issues and a $4.7 million one time reduction in interest expense in 2009 related to debt extinguishment transactions consummated in October 2009. See Note 5 for additional information. Interest expense decreased $10.7 million (5.0%) in 2008 compared to 2007. An $18.0 million decrease due to lower average interest rates was partially offset by a $9.3 million increase due to increased average debt outstanding. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to our core operations, including gains or losses from nonoperating asset dispositions and impairments, our share of the income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during construction. Other income (expense) was $(48.2) million for 2009 compared to $42.3 million for 2008 and $40.0 million in 2007. Included in 2009 is (i) a $72.0 million pre tax charge related to certain debt extinguishment transactions consummated in October 2009 (see Note 5 for additional information) and (ii) an $8.0 million pre tax charge associated with our $800 million bridge credit facility (see Note 2 for additional information). Included in 2008 is (i) approximately $10 million related to the recognition of previously accrued transaction related and other contingencies; (ii) a pre tax gain of $4.5 million upon the liquidation of our investments in marketable securities in our SERP trust; (iii) a pre tax gain of approximately $7.3 million from the sales of certain nonoperating investments; and (iv) a $3.4 million pre tax charge related to terminating all of our existing derivative instruments in the first quarter of 2008. The year 2007 includes a non recurring pre tax gain of $10.4 million related to the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership and a $5.2 million pre tax gain resulting from the final distribution of funds from the Rural Telephone Bank redemption mentioned below. Our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership increased $7.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and decreased $2.5 million in 2008 compared to 2007. We record our share of the partnership income based on unaudited results of operations until the time we receive audited financial statements for the partnership from the unaffiliated general partner. Upon receipt of the respective audited financial statements, we recorded unfavorable adjustments in 2008 (upon completion of the 2007 audit) and favorable adjustments in 2007 (upon completion of the 2006 and 2005 audits). 60 INCOME TAX EXPENSE The effective income tax rate was 37.2%, 34.7%, and 32.4% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Certain executive compensation amounts, including the lump sum distributions paid to certain executive officers in connection with discontinuing the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (see Note 11), are reflected as non deductible for income tax purposes pursuant to executive compensation limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The treatment of these amounts as non deductible resulted in the recognition of approximately $9.2 million of income tax expense in 2009 above amounts that would have been recognized had such payments been deductible for income tax purposes. Our 2009 effective tax rate is also higher because a portion of our merger related transaction costs incurred during 2009 are non deductible for income tax purposes (with such treatment resulting in a $6.9 million increase to income tax expense). Such increases in income tax expense were partially offset by a $7.0 million reduction in income tax expense primarily caused by a reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards primarily due to a law change in one of our operating states that we believe will allow us to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards in the future. Prior to the law change, such net operating loss carryforwards were fully reserved as it was more likely than not that these carryforwards would not be utilized prior to expiration. Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $15.7 million in 2009, $12.8 million in 2008 and $32.7 million in 2007 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits (see Critical Accounting Policies below and Note 12) and other adjustments upon finalization of tax returns. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM Upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting on July 1, 2009, we recorded a one time extraordinary gain of approximately $136.0 million after tax. See Note 15 for additional information related to this extraordinary gain. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance regarding the accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The codification is now the single source of authoritative United States GAAP for all non governmental entities. The codification, which became effective July 1, 2009, changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance. The issuance of this codification standard will not change GAAP, and therefore the adoption of this guidance will only affect how specific references to GAAP literature are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in our reports filed with the SEC. 61 In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance on business combinations, which requires an acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. Such guidance also changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including acquisition costs, acquired contingent liabilities, restructuring costs, deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date and is effective for us for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We have accounted for our acquisition of Embarq using this guidance. During 2009, we incurred approximately $47.2 million of transaction related expenses (primarily investment banker and legal fees) related to our acquisition of Embarq. Such costs are required to be expensed as incurred and are reflected in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2009. In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities. Based on this guidance, we have concluded that our outstanding non vested restricted stock is a participating security and therefore should be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share using the two class method. The guidance was effective for us beginning in first quarter 2009 and required us to recast our previously reported earnings per share. Under the new accounting guidance, we have recast our previously reported diluted earnings per share for 2008 ($3.56 per share) and 2007 ($3.72 per share) as $3.52 per share for 2008 and $3.71 for 2007. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance regarding noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, which requires noncontrolling interests to be recognized as equity in the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, net income attributable to such noncontrolling interests is required to be included in consolidated net income. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Our financial statements as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 reflect our noncontrolling interests as equity in our consolidated balance sheet. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. In January 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance related to employers disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets, which expands the disclosures required by previous guidance to discuss the assumptions and risks used to compute fair value for each category of plan assets. See Notes 10 and 11 for additional information. We are subject to certain accounting standards that define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures about fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements. The fair value accounting guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include: Level 1 (defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets), Level 2 (defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable), and Level 3 (defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists). See Note 18 for additional information. 62 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) intangible and long lived assets, (v) business combinations and (vi) income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions and these differences may be material. We believe these critical accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. We collect in advance fees for fixed rate services, such as local service, unlimited long distance, high speed Internet and certain data services, and defer revenue recognition until these services are provided to the customer. We bill in arrears variable rate billing services, including minute driven long distance, data and access revenues. We have multiple billing cycles spread throughout each month resulting in accounts receivables and deferred revenue balances at the end of each reporting period. In the event that the variable rate usage date is not available at the end of a reporting period, we estimate revenue based on historic usage and other relevant factors. Service activation and installation fees are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the average life of the customer. Operating revenues include certain revenue reserves for billing disputes and contract interpretations. These reserves require managements judgment and are based on many factors including historical trends, contract and tariff interpretations and developments during the resolution process. Allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we may need to increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Pension and postretirement benefits. Accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee provides service to us. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of various assumptions, such as discount rates, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and inflation through a collaborative effort by management and independent actuaries. The results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgment and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements. Changes in assumptions used could result in a material impact to our financial results in any given period. 63 The pension plan we assumed in connection with the Embarq acquisition was underfunded by approximately $1.0 billion with respect to the projected benefit obligation as of the July 1, 2009 acquisition date. In the third quarter of 2009, we contributed $115 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan. We currently expect to contribute approximately $300 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan in 2010. Based on current actuarial estimates as of December 31, 2009 that assume a $300 million contribution in 2010, the utilization of our existing remaining credit balance to partially satisfy future required cash contributions and assuming no further discretionary contributions are made, we would not be required to make a minimum contribution to the legacy Embarq pension plan until 2012. Our minimum required contributions to our other pension plans are immaterial. The actual level of contributions required in future years can change significantly depending on discount rates and actual returns on plan assets. A significant assumption used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2009 and 2008, we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25% for our incumbent pension plan and 8.50% for the pension plan we assumed in connection with the Embarq acquisition. We believe such return assumptions reflect the expected long term rates of return in the financial markets based on our current plan asset allocation. We also reviewed the historical rates of return on those plan assets over long term periods that ranged from 10 to 20 years. A 25 basis point decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase our annual combined pension and postretirement expense approximately $8.0 million. Should we experience asset returns that are significantly below our 8.25 8.50% long term rate of return assumptions, we may experience in the future higher levels of pension expense, higher levels of required contributions and lower stockholders equity balances (due to accumulated other comprehensive losses). Another assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is an assumed rate of return derived from high quality debt securities that, if applicable at the measurement date to a specified amount of principal, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay our pension benefit obligations when they become due. For our pension plans, the discount rate used for the December 31, 2009 and 2008 measurement dates were derived by matching projected benefit payments to bond yields obtained from the CitiGroup Pension Discount Curve (Above Median) which are ultimately derived from the AA rated corporate bond sector. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we utilized the CitiGroup Pension Discount Curve to derive our discount rate. Our discount rate for determining benefit obligations under our pension plans at December 31, 2009 ranged from 5.5 to 6.0% compared to 6.6 to 6.9% at December 31, 2008. The discount rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. We use a similar methodology to determine the discount rate for our postretirement plan by utilizing as a reference the Hewitt Top Quartile Yield Curve as of the end of the year. Our discount rate for determining benefit obligations under our postretirement plans at December 31, 2009 was 5.70 5.80% compared to 6.9% at December 31, 2008. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase annual combined pension and postretirement expense approximately $2.0 million. 64 Intangible and long lived assets. We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets (including goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets) based on applicable accounting guidelines. We are required to review goodwill recorded in business combinations for impairment at least annually and are required to write down the value of goodwill only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. As disclosed in the table below, substantially all of our goodwill is associated with our local exchange telephone operations. Subsequent to our acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009, we have managed our local exchange telephone operations based on five geographic regions (which we internally refer to as Mid Atlantic, Southern, South Central, Northeast and Western) and have considered these five operating regions to be our reporting units in testing for goodwill impairment of our telephone operations. Prior to our Embarq acquisition, we managed our local exchange telephone operations based on three geographic regions. The remainder of our goodwill is associated with our competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC), fiber transport, security monitoring and other operations of our business, all of which we treat as separate reporting units in our goodwill impairment testing. The breakdown of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2009 by reporting unit is as follows (amounts in thousands): Telephone operations (Mid Atlantic) $ 2,224,699 Telephone operations (Southern) 2,294,998 Telephone operations (South Central) 2,486,041 Telephone operations (Northeast) 2,250,397 Telephone operations (Western) 945,834 CLEC operations 29,935 Fiber transport operations 10,607 Security monitoring operations 4,966 All other operations 4,281 Total goodwill $ 10,251,758 We estimate the fair value of our telephone operations reporting units using a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA), as described below. For each telephone reporting unit, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. 65 As of September 30, 2009, we completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment. Such impairment test excluded the goodwill associated with our acquisition of Embarq pending finalization of the determination of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection therewith. We determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of such date. As of December 31, 2009, we performed a subsequent impairment test that included the goodwill associated with our Embarq acquisition and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2009. The multiple of EBITDA we utilize in our goodwill impairment testing for our telephone operations is supported by a sum of the parts independent valuation analysis performed and updated annually by a major investment banking firm on behalf of its clients. This valuation report includes CenturyTel as well as other peer companies in the local exchange carrier industry. In the most recent analysis performed by this firm, valuations of specific assets were based on a combination of public and private market comparables and EBITDA multiples were affected by access line trends and the future expectations of those trends. Based on the above, we utilized an EBITDA multiple of 5.6 times for our goodwill impairment analyses performed as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009. For the past several years, we have consistently utilized the EBITDA multiples derived from this independent analysis. The EBITDA multiple derived in the analyst report and utilized in our goodwill impairment testing decreased from 7.0 in 2007 to 6.5 in 2008 to 5.6 in 2009, in large part we believe due to the continued erosion of access lines. As of December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of the Southern region exceeded its carrying value by less than 5%. Should events occur (such as continued access line losses or other revenue reductions) that would cause the fair value to decline below its carrying value, we may be required to record a non cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined. We estimate the fair value of our other reporting units using various methods, including multiples of EBITDA (as described above) and multiples of revenues. We completed the tests of goodwill impairment (as of September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009) for our other reporting units and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of such dates. The carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. We recognized a $16.6 million pre tax impairment charge in 2007 related to certain of our CLEC assets that were subsequently sold in 2008. Business combinations. The new accounting guidance for business combinations was effective for us for all business combinations consummated on or after January 1, 2009 and requires an acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. We were the accounting acquirer in our acquisition of Embarq. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Embarq (and the related estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets) required a significant amount of judgment and was considered a critical estimate. Such allocation of certain aspects of the purchase price to items that are more complex to value was performed by an independent valuation firm based on information provided by management. See Note 2 for additional information concerning the assignment of fair values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Embarq. 66 Income taxes. We estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in our tax returns. These liabilities are estimated based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances. Changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of change. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized approximately $15.7 million, $12.8 million, and $32.7 million, respectively, of previously unrecognized tax benefits (including related interest and net of federal tax benefit) and other adjustments upon finalization of tax returns. Such benefits were recorded primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of audits, administrative practices and the lapse of statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions. See Note 12 for additional information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits. For additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters below, and the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. INFLATION The vast majority of our telephone operations are now regulated under price cap regulation for interstate purposes, for which price changes for certain revenue components are limited to the rate of inflation. As operating expenses in our nonregulated lines of business increase as a result of inflation, we, to the extent permitted by competition, attempt to recover the costs by increasing prices for our services and equipment. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. We determine fair value of long term debt obligations based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing markets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. 67 In connection with our Embarq acquisition, Embarqs existing long term debt as of the acquisition date was valued at its estimated fair value. At December 31, 2009, we estimated the fair value of our long term debt to be $8.4 billion based on the overall weighted average interest rate of our debt of 7.1% and an overall weighted maturity of 11 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 96.2% of our long term debt obligations were fixed rate. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 71 basis points in interest rates (ten percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $362.1 million decrease in fair value of our fixed rate long term debt at December 31, 2009, but would have no impact on our results of operations or cash flows. A 100 basis point increase in variable interest rates would have had a negative pre tax impact of approximately $2.6 million on our results of operations and cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, but would have no impact on the fair value of our long term variable rate debt. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time over the past several years, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. In January 2008, we terminated all of our existing fixed to variable interest rate swaps associated with the $500 million principal amount of our Series L senior notes, due 2012. In connection with the termination of these derivatives, we received aggregate cash payments of approximately $25.6 million, which has been reflected as a premium of the associated long term debt and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense through 2012 using the effective interest method. In addition, in January 2008, we also terminated certain other derivatives that were not deemed to be effective hedges. Upon the termination of these derivatives, we paid an aggregate of approximately $4.9 million (and recorded a $3.4 million pre tax charge in the first quarter of 2008 related to the settlement of these derivatives). As of December 31, 2009, we had no derivative instruments outstanding. We are also exposed to market risk from changes in the fair value of our pension plan assets. While our pension plan asset returns were positive for 2009, the loss on our incumbent pension plan assets was approximately 28% for 2008. If our actual return on plan assets is significantly lower than our expected return assumption, our net periodic pension expense will increase in the future and we may be required to contribute additional funds to our pension plans in the future. The pension plan we assumed in our acquisition of Embarq was substantially underfunded as of the acquisition date. During the last half of 2009, we contributed $115 million to the Embarq pension plan. Such plan may require a significant amount of additional funding in the near future. Based on current actuarial estimates as of December 31, 2009 that assume a $300 million contribution in 2010, the utilization of our existing remaining credit balance to partially satisfy future required cash contributions and assuming no further discretionary contributions are made, we would not be required to make a minimum contribution to the legacy Embarq pension plan until 2012. Our minimum required contributions to our other pension plans are immaterial. The actual level of contributions required in future years can change significantly depending on discount rates and actual returns on plan assets. 68 Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair value calculations. The analysis above incorporates only those risk exposures that existed as of December 31, 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to fund our dividend payments and our operating and capital expenditures. During the last few months of 2008, we borrowed against our long term revolving credit facility and held excess cash to provide us flexibility in the challenging economic environment. As a result, our working capital position was positive as of December 31, 2008. During 2009, we repaid a portion of these borrowings which resulted in a negative working capital position as of December 31, 2009, which is more representative of our typical working capital position. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long term program of capital improvements. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.574 billion, $853.3 million and $1.030 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Payments for income taxes aggregated $258.9 million, $208.8 million and $185.3 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, we paid approximately $54 million to fund lump sum distributions under our frozen supplemental executive retirement plan upon the discontinuance of such plan and under change of control provisions triggered upon the acquisition of Embarq. We also contributed $115 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan during the last half of 2009. Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of these periods. For additional information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $678.8 million, $389.0 million and $619.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Payments for property, plant and equipment were $754.5 million in 2009 (which includes $396.1 million of capital expenditures attributable to our Embarq operations subsequent to our July 1, 2009 acquisition of Embarq), $286.8 million in 2008 and $326.0 million in 2007. Capital expenditures for 2009 include approximately $75.1 million of one time capital expenditures related to the integration of Embarq. We used $306.8 million of cash (net of approximately $20.0 million of acquired cash) to purchase Madison River Communications Corp. and pay related closing costs on April 30, 2007. 69 During 2008, we paid an aggregate of approximately $149 million for 69 licenses in the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) auction of 700 megahertz (MHz) wireless spectrum. We expect to complete our planning regarding the use of this spectrum in the first half of 2010 and to begin our trial phase in late 2010 or early 2011. Based on our planning, we are considering developing wireless voice and data service capabilities based on equipment using LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology. Given that simple data devices are not expected to be commercially available until later this year and more complex, integrated voice and data devices such as smartphones are not expected to be available until 2012, we do not expect to deploy network equipment, other than trial equipment, in 2010. Therefore, our deployment plans will not likely result in any material impact to our capital and operating budgets for 2010. On July 1, 2009, we consummated the acquisition of Embarq Corporation by issuing approximately $6.0 billion of CenturyTel common stock (valued as of June 30, 2009). We financed our merger transaction expenses with (i) available cash of the combined company and (ii) proceeds from CenturyTels and Embarqs existing revolving credit facilities. We acquired $76.9 million of cash in connection with our acquisition of Embarq. In anticipation of making lump sum distributions to certain participants of our SERP in early 2009, we liquidated our investments in marketable securities in the SERP trust during the second quarter of 2008 and thereby increased our cash and cash equivalents by $34.9 million. As noted above, the lump sum distributions were paid in 2009 and aggregated approximately $54 million. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $976.4 million during 2009, $255.4 million in 2008, and $402.1 million in 2007. In September 2009, we received net proceeds of $644.4 million from the issuance of $250 million of 10 year, 6.15% senior notes and $400 million of 30 year, 7.6% senior notes. In October 2009, the proceeds from these note offerings, along with additional borrowings under our existing credit facility, were used to buy back an aggregate of $746.1 million of CenturyTel, Inc. and Embarq indebtedness (see Note 5 for additional information). During 2008, we paid our $240 million Series F Senior Notes at maturity primarily using borrowings from our credit facility. In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 9.7 million shares (for $347.3 million) and 10.2 million shares (for $460.7 million) in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In late March 2007, we publicly issued an aggregate of $750 million of Senior Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of such Senior Notes aggregated approximately $741.8 million and were used (along with cash on hand and approximately $50 million of borrowings under our commercial paper program) to (i) finance the initial purchase price for the April 30, 2007 acquisition of Madison River ($322 million) and (ii) pay off Madison Rivers existing indebtedness (including accrued interest) at closing ($522 million). 70 In June 2008, our Board of Directors (i) increased our annual cash dividend to $2.80 from $.27 per share and (ii) declared a one time dividend of $.6325 per share, which was paid in July 2008, effectively adjusting the total second quarter dividend to the new $.70 quarterly dividend rate. In February 2010, our Board of Directors further increased our quarterly dividend to $.725 per share. Based on current circumstances, we intend to continue our current dividend practice, subject to our intention to maintain investment grade credit ratings on our senior debt and any other factors that our Board in its discretion deems relevant. In the first quarter of 2008, we received a net cash settlement of approximately $20.7 million from the termination of all of our existing derivative instruments. See Market Risk above for additional information concerning the termination of these derivatives. During 2008, CenturyTel suffered a substantial loss on its pension plan assets. The pension plan we assumed in our acquisition of Embarq was substantially underfunded as of the acquisition date. If this underfunded status continues, we may be required to contribute additional funds to our pension plan in the near future. To reduce the underfunded position, in March 2010 we expect to contribute $300 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan using cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility. For further information, see Item 1A Risk Factors, of this annual report. As previously announced, Embarq amended its credit facility to enable the facility to remain in place as an $800 million revolving credit facility after the completion of the merger through May 2011. See Note 2 for additional information. Subsequent to the Embarq acquisition, we have available two unsecured revolving credit facilities, (i) a five year, $728 million facility of CenturyTel which expires in December 2011 and (ii) an $800 million facility of Embarq which expires in May 2011. These credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to meet certain leverage ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios. Up to $250 million of the credit facilities can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $46 million of letters of credit were outstanding. Available borrowings under these credit facilities are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program borrowings are effectively limited to the total amount available under the two credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $291.2 million outstanding under our credit facilities (all of which relates to CenturyTels facility) and no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. As described in Note 5, we called for redemption on August 14, 2007, all of our $165 million aggregate principal amount of Series K convertible senior debentures, subject to the right of holders to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $40.455. In lieu of cash redemption, holders of approximately $149.6 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately 3.7 million shares of CenturyTel common stock. The remaining $15.4 million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash (including premium and accrued and unpaid interest). 71 Other. For 2010, we have budgeted between $825 875 million for capital expenditures. Previously, we concluded that our prior extensive capital investment in our wireline network permitted us to reduce wireline network capital spending to maintenance levels. Our 2010 capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and our data networks. The following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2014 and Other (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 7,753,718 500,065 630,328 849,926 5,773,399 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 6,714,617 539,504 1,003,065 874,946 4,297,102 Unrecognized tax benefits (2) $ 81,663 81,663 (1) For additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. (2) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay assuming we are required to pay the entire amount that we have reserved for our unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 12 for additional information). The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the After 2014 and Other column in the above table. We continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expect to continue our long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractively priced communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitions under our acquisition shelf registration statement. We also have access to debt and equity capital markets. Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) currently rates CenturyTel, Inc.s and Embarq Corporations long term debt Baa3 (with a stable outlook). Standard & Poors (S&P) rates the same long term debt BBB (with a stable outlook). Our commercial paper program is rated P 3 by Moodys and A 3 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict our access to the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing our financial or operating flexibility. 72 The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. The debt to total capitalization ratio for 2009 reflects our Embarq acquisition. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends calculation for 2009 reflects the operations of Embarq only since July 1, 2009. 2009 2008 2007 Debt to total capitalization 45.0 % 51.2 46.9 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.17 3.74 3.85 * For purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes (before extraordinary item) and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend costs. 73 Regulation and Competition The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with LEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services. Similarly, electronic mail and other digital communications continue to reduce the demand for traditional landline voice services. We anticipate these trends will continue. Federal USF programs have undergone substantial changes since 1997, and are expected to experience more changes in the coming years as the overall program is modernized. As mandated by the 1996 Act, in May 2001 the FCC modified its existing universal service support mechanism for rural telephone companies by adopting an interim mechanism for a five year period based on embedded, or historical, costs that provide relatively predictable levels of support to many LECs, including substantially all of our LECs. In May 2006, the FCC extended this interim mechanism until such time that new high cost support rules are adopted for rural telephone companies. Increased requests for payments, coupled with changes in usage of telecommunications services, have placed stress on the funding mechanism of the USF, which is subject to annual caps on disbursements. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including payments we receive from the USF High Cost Loop program. Increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all USF recipients caused our revenues from the USF High Cost Loop program (exclusive of USF revenues recognized during the last half of 2009 in connection with our Embarq acquisition) to decrease approximately $13 million in 2009 when compared to 2008. We estimate that our 2010 revenues from the USF High Cost Loop program will be approximately $45 million lower as compared to the annual run rate for the last half of 2009. Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional LEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Improvements in the quality of "Voice over Internet Protocol" ("VoIP") service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers frequently use existing broadband networks to deliver flat rate, all distance calling plans that may offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional LECs and may be priced below those currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services. In late 2003, the FCC initiated a rulemaking intended to address the regulation of VoIP, and has adopted orders establishing some initial broad regulatory guidelines. The FCC has not completed the rulemaking, but could address the treatment of VoIP traffic and services by concluding this proceeding or in combination with intercarrier compensation reform proceedings already underway. There can be no assurance that future rulemaking will be on terms favorable to ILECs, or that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers. 74 Beginning in 2003, the FCC opened broad intercarrier compensation proceedings designed to create a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, transiting or delivering telecommunications traffic. In connection therewith, the FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and solicited public comments on a variety of topics related to access charges and intercarrier compensation. Broad industry negotiations have taken place with the goal of developing a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of carriers from all industry segments. The ultimate outcome of the FCCs intercarrier compensation proceedings could change the way we receive compensation from, and remit compensation to, other carriers, our end user customers and the federal USF. Until the FCCs proceedings conclude and the changes, if any, to the existing rules are established, we cannot estimate the impact these proceedings will have on our operations. Many cable, technology or other communication companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Several of these companies started offering full service bundles before us, which could give them an advantage in building customer loyalty. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for our access lines. Recent events affecting us. During the last few years, most of the states in which we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the LEC business. The number of companies which have requested authorization to provide local exchange service in our service areas has increased in recent years, particularly in Embarqs legacy markets, and we anticipate that similar action may be taken by others in the future. Certain long distance carriers continue to request that certain of our ILECs reduce intrastate access tariffed rates. Long distance carriers have also aggressively pursued regulatory or legislative changes that would reduce access rates. In light of pending intercarrier compensation reform that is expected to address intrastate access charges, most states are deferring action until they receive direction from the FCC. However, some carriers are continuing to pursue lower intrastate access rates in some states. Currently, we are responding to carrier complaints, legislation or investigations regarding our intrastate switched access rate levels in Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Virginia. Although the outcome cannot be determined at this time, we believe our intrastate switched access rate levels are appropriate and we plan to vigorously defend them. Over the past few years, each of the FCC, Universal Service Administrative Company and certain Congressional committees has initiated wide ranging reviews of the administration of the federal USF. As part of this process, we, along with a number of other USF recipients, have undergone a number of USF audits and have also received requests for information from the FCCs Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Congressional committees. In addition, in July 2008 we received a subpoena from the OIG requesting a broad range of information regarding our depreciation rates and methodologies since 2000, and in July 2009 we received a second subpoena requesting information about our participation in the E rate program for Wisconsin schools and libraries since 2004. The OIG has not identified to us any specific issues with respect to our participation in the USF program and none of the audits completed to date has identified any material issues regarding our participation in the USF program. While we believe our participation is in compliance with FCC rules and in accordance with accepted industry practices, we cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of these various reviews. We have complied with and are continuing to respond to all requests for information. 75 We expect our 2010 operating revenues to be higher than 2009 since 2010 will include a full year of operating results from our Embarq properties acquired July 1, 2009. Excluding this impact, we expect our operating revenues in 2010 to decline as we continue to experience downward pressure primarily due to continued access line losses, reduced universal service funding and lower network access revenues. In addition, our revenues will be negatively impacted in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a full year impact of the elimination of all intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting that was effective July 1, 2009 (which will not impact operating income levels since there will be an equivalent amount of expenses eliminated). We expect such revenue declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand for our high speed Internet service offering. For a more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual report. Other matters. Through June 30, 2009, CenturyTel accounted for its regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) in accordance with the provisions of codification ASC 980 10 (formerly SFAS 71) which addresses regulatory accounting under which actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. Such regulatory assets and liabilities were required to be recorded and, accordingly, reflected in the balance sheet of an entity subject to regulatory accounting. As we previously disclosed, on July 1, 2009, we discontinued the accounting requirements of regulatory accounting upon the conversion of substantially all of our rate of return study areas to federal price cap regulation (based on the FCCs approval of our petition to convert our study areas to price cap regulation). In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a net non cash extraordinary after tax gain of approximately $136.0 million upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. See Note 15 for additional information. 76 We have certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2009 have not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
