Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations All references to Notes in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. OVERVIEW On July 1, 2009, we acquired Embarq Corporation (Embarq) in a transaction that substantially expanded the size and scope of our business. The results of operations of Embarq are included in our consolidated results of operations beginning July 1, 2009. Due to the significant size of Embarq, direct comparisons of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 (which includes a full year of results of operations from our Embarq properties) and December 31, 2009 (which only includes a half year of results of operations from our Embarq properties) with prior periods are less meaningful than usual since most of the significant period over period variances are caused by the Embarq acquisition. We discuss below certain trends that we believe are significant, even if they are no t necessarily material to the combined company. We are an integrated communications company primarily engaged in providing a broad array of communications services to customers in 33 states, including local and long distance voice, wholesale network access, special access, high speed Internet access, other data services, and video services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide fiber transport, competitive local exchange carrier, security monitoring, and other communications, professional and business information services. We operate approximately 6.5 million access lines and serve approximately 2.4 million broadband customers, based on operating data as of December 31, 2010. For additional information on our revenue sources, see Note 20. For additional information on our acquisition of Embarq, see Note 2. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred a significant amount of one time expenses, the vast majority of which are directly attributable to our acquisition of Embarq and our pending acquisition of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Qwest). In 2010, we also recognized a $20.9 million reduction to operating expenses related to a curtailment gain upon the freezing of benefit accruals for non represented employees under our defined benefit pension plans. See Note 12 for additional information. Such one time expenses are summarized in the table below. 55 Year ended December 31, Description 2010 2009 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products Integration related costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq $ 36,573 Severance costs and accelerated recognition of share based compensation and pension costs due to workforce reductions 13,702 5,704 Curtailment gain related to changes in our defined benefit pension plan (5,895 ) Selling, general and administrative Integration related costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq 54,941 86,371 Severance costs and accelerated recognition of share based compensation and pension costs due to workforce reductions 16,490 114,462 Transaction and other costs associated with our pending acquisition of Qwest 22,265 Curtailment gain related to changes in our defined benefit pension plan (15,013 ) Transaction related costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq, including investment banker and legal fees 47,154 Settlement and curtailment loss related to certain executive retirement plans 17,834 Interest expense Credit associated with certain debt extinguishments (11,119 ) Other income (expense) Net charge associated with certain debt extinguishments 71,968 Charge incurred in connection with terminating our $800 million bridge facility 8,000 $ 123,063 340,374 Based on current plans and information, we expect to incur approximately $80 90 million of additional non recurring integration related operating expenses associated with our Embarq acquisition in 2011 and $400 500 million of non recurring transaction and integration related operating expenses associated with our Qwest acquisition in 2011, although actual amounts could vary significantly. In addition, due to executive compensation limitations pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of the lump sum distributions related to the termination of an executive retirement plan made in the first quarter of 2009 is reflected as non deductible for income tax purposes and thus increased our effective income tax rate. Certain merger related costs incurred during 2010 and 2009 are also non deductible for income tax purposes and similarly increased our effective income tax rate. In 2009, such increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by a $7.0 million reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, in 2009 and 2008, we recognized net after tax benefits of approximately $15.7 million and $12.8 million, respectively, primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 13 and Income Tax Expense below for additional information. 56 Upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009, we recorded a one time, non cash extraordinary gain that aggregated approximately $218.6 million before income tax expense and noncontrolling interests ($136.0 million after tax and noncontrolling interests). See Note 16 for additional information. During the last several years (exclusive of acquisitions and certain non recurring favorable adjustments), we have experienced revenue declines in our voice and network access revenues primarily due to declines in access lines, intrastate access rates, minutes of use, and federal support fund payments. In an attempt to mitigate these declines, we plan to, among other things, (i) promote long term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services, (ii) provide new services, such as video and other additional services that may become available in the future due to advances in technology, wireless spectrum sales by the FCC or improvements in our infrastructure, or agency or reselling arrangements with other carriers, (iii) provide our special access, broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers, (iv) pursue acquisitions of additional communications properties if available at attractive prices, (v) increase usage of our networks and (vi) market our products and services to new customers. In addition to historical information, this managements discussion and analysis includes certain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations only, and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Actual events and results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected if one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect. Factors that could affect actual results include but are not limited to: the timing, success and overall effects of competition from a wide variety of competitive providers; the risks inherent in rapid technological change; the effects of ongoing changes in the regulation of the communications industry (includi ng those arising out of the FCCs proposed rules regarding intercarrier compensation and the Universal Service Fund and the FCCs related Notice of Proposed Rulemaking released on February 8, 2011); our ability to effectively adjust to changes in the communications industry and changes in the composition of our markets and product mix caused by our recent acquisitions; our ability to successfully integrate Embarq into our operations, including the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the Embarq merger cannot be fully realized in a timely manner or at all, or that integrating Embarqs operations into ours will be more difficult, disruptive or costly than anticipated; our ability to successfully complete our pending acquisition of Qwest, including timely receiving all regulatory approvals and realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction; our ability to effectively manage our expansion opportunities, including retaining and hiring key personnel; possible changes in the demand for, or pricing of, our products and services; our ability to successfully introduce new product or service offerings on a timely and cost effective basis; our continued access to credit markets on favorable terms; our ability to collect our receivables from financially troubled communications companies; our ability to pay a $2.90 per common share dividend annually, which may be affected by changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flows or financial position; unanticipated increases in our capital expenditures; our ability to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements on reasonable terms without work stoppages; the effects of adverse weather; other risks referenced from time to time in this report or other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC; and the effects of more general factors such as changes in interest rates, in tax rates, in accounting policies or practices, in operating, medical, pension or administrative costs, in general market, labor or economic conditions, or in legislation, regulation or public policy. These and other uncertainties related to our business, our pending acquisition of Qwest and our July 2009 acquisition of Embarq are described in greater detail in Item 1A of this report, as updated and supplemented by our subsequent SEC reports. You should be aware that new factors may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to identify all such factors nor can we predict the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any one or more factors may cause actual results to differ from those reflected in any forward looking statements. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to update any of our forward looking statements for any reason. 57 58 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net income attributable to CenturyLink, Inc. for 2010 was $947.7 million, compared to $647.2 million during 2009 and $365.7 million during 2008. Net income before extraordinary item was $947.7 million, $511.3 million and $365.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Diluted earnings per share for 2010 was $3.13 compared to $3.23 in 2009 and $3.52 in 2008. Diluted earnings per share before extraordinary item for 2009 was $2.55. As mentioned in the Overview section above, we incurred a significant amount of one time expenses in 2010 and 2009 related principally to our acquisition of Embarq and our pending acquisition of Qwest. The increase in the number of average shares outstanding in 2010 and 2009 is primarily attributable to t he common stock issued in connection with our acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009 (such shares are included for a full year in 2010 and a half year in 2009). Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars, except per share amounts, and shares in thousands) Operating income $ 2,059,944 1,233,101 721,352 Interest expense (557,478 ) (370,414 ) (202,217 ) Other income (expense) 29,619 (48,175 ) 42,252 Income tax expense (582,951 ) (301,881 ) (194,357 ) Income before noncontrolling interests and extraordinary item 949,134 512,631 367,030 Noncontrolling interests (1,429 ) (1,377 ) (1,298 ) Net income before extraordinary item 947,705 511,254 365,732 Extraordinary item, net of income tax expense and noncontrolling interests 135,957 Net income attributable to CenturyLink, Inc. $ 947,705 647,211 365,732 Basic earnings per share Before extraordinary item $ 3.13 2.55 3.53 Extraordinary item $ .68 Basic earnings per share $ 3.13 3.23 3.53 Diluted earnings per share Before extraordinary item $ 3.13 2.55 3.52 Extraordinary item $ .68 Diluted earnings per share $ 3.13 3.23 3.52 Average basic shares outstanding 300,619 198,813 102,268 Average diluted shares outstanding 301,297 199,057 102,560 Operating income increased $826.8 million in 2010 due to a $2.067 billion increase in operating revenues and a $1.240 billion increase in operating expenses. Operating income increased $511.7 million in 2009 due to a $2.374 billion increase in operating revenues and a $1.863 billion increase in operating expenses. Such increases in operating revenues, operating expenses and operating income in 2010 and 2009 were substantially due to our July 1, 2009 acquisition of Embarq. 59 As mentioned in Note 16, we discontinued the application of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009. As a result of such discontinuance, since the third quarter of 2009 we have eliminated all intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that previously were not eliminated under the application of regulatory accounting. This has caused our revenues and operating expenses to be lower by equivalent amounts (approximately $104 million) for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Similarly, our revenues and operating expenses for 2009 are lower than 2008 by approximately $108 million due to the mid year discontinuance of regulatory accounting. OPERATING REVENUES Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Voice $ 3,137,921 2,168,480 1,043,386 Data 1,908,901 1,202,284 524,194 Network access 1,079,678 927,905 651,038 Other 915,034 675,570 381,129 Operating revenues $ 7,041,534 4,974,239 2,599,747 Beginning in 2010, we have reclassified revenues generated from subscriber line charges to Voice revenues from Network access revenues to better align our presentation of such revenues with others in our industry and we have included revenues generated from our fiber transport, CLEC and security monitoring operations in Other revenues. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the new presentation. Voice revenues. We derive voice revenues by providing local exchange telephone services and retail long distance services to customers in our service areas. The $969.4 million increase in voice revenues is primarily due to $1.047 billion of additional revenues attributable to the Embarq properties acquired July 1, 2009. The remaining $77.8 million decrease is primarily due to (i) a $35.3 million decrease due to a 6.2% decline in the average number of access lines in our legacy CenturyLink markets; (ii) a $13.7 million decrease in custom calling feature revenues primarily due to the continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at a lower rate; (iii) an $11.1 million reduction in long distance revenues due primarily to a decreas e in minutes of use; and (vi) a $9.1 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the above described discontinuance of regulatory accounting. The $1.125 billion increase in voice revenues in 2009 is primarily due to $1.199 billion of revenues attributable to the Embarq properties acquired July 1, 2009. The remaining $73.9 million decrease is primarily due to (i) a $42.0 million decrease due to a 6.6% decline in the average number of access lines in our incumbent markets; (ii) a $14.5 million decrease in custom calling feature revenues primarily due to the continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at a lower effective rate and (iii) an $8.1 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. Total access lines declined 535,000 during 2010 compared to a decline of 380,000 during 2009 (excluding access lines we acquired from Embarq on July 1, 2009 but including access lines lost in Embarqs markets following such acquisition). We believe the decline in the number of access lines during 2010 is primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive services and recent economic conditions. Based on our current retention initiatives, we estimate that our access line loss will be between 7.0% and 7.5% in 2011 (exclusive of the impact of access line loss in the properties we expect to acquire from Qwest in 2011). 60 Data revenues. We derive our data revenues primarily by providing high speed Internet access services and data transmission services over special circuits and private lines. Data revenues increased $706.6 million in 2010 due to $735.1 million of additional revenues attributable to Embarq. Excluding Embarq, data revenues decreased $28.5 million due to a $52.9 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. The remaining $24.4 million increase is primarily attributable to an increase in DSL related revenues principally due to growth in the number of DSL customers and an increase in special access revenues due to increased demand for such services. Data revenues increased $678.1 million in 2009 due to $689.8 million of revenues attributable to Embarq. Excluding Embarq, data revenues decreased $11.7 million due to a $51.4 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. Such decrease was partially offset by a $38.5 million increase in DSL related revenues primarily due to growth in the number of DSL customers in our incumbent markets. Network access revenues. We derive our network access revenues primarily from (i) providing services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions; (ii) receiving universal support funds which allows us to recover a portion of our costs under federal and state cost recovery mechanisms; (iii) receiving reciprocal compensation from competitive local exchange carriers and wireless service providers for terminating their calls; and (iv) offering certain network facilities and related services to CLECs. Substantially all of our interstate network access revenues are based on tariffed access charges prescribed by the FCC. Certain of our intrasta te network access revenues are derived through access charges that we bill to intrastate long distance carriers and other LEC customers. 61 Network access revenues increased $151.8 million in 2010 and $276.9 million in 2009 due to the following factors: 2010 2009 increase increase (decrease) (decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009 $ 247,615 347,680 Reduced recoveries from the federal Universal Service High Cost Loop support program (35,815 ) (12,964 ) Reduced intrastate revenues due to decreased minutes of use, decreased access rates in certain states and recoveries from state support funds (17,275 ) (35,406 ) Elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting (21,509 ) (26,031 ) Reduced partial recovery of operating costs through revenue sharing arrangements with other telephone companies, interstate access revenues and return on rate base (13,441 ) (5,930 ) Prior year revenue settlement agreements and other (7,802 ) 9,518 $ 151,773 276,867 As mentioned above, upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009, we began eliminating all intercompany transactions with regulated affiliates that previously were not eliminated under the application of regulatory accounting. We believe that access rates and minutes of use will continue to decline in conjunction with losses of access lines and substitution of other alternatives, although we cannot precisely estimate the magnitude of such decrease. Complaints filed by interexchange carriers in several of our operating states or state initiated legislation could, if successful, place further downward pressure on our intrastate access rates. We also expect our network access revenues to continue to be negatively impacted in 2011 by a reduction in Universal Service Fund receipts. In addition, delays in the migration of traffic of a wireless carrier off our networks in 2010 will reduce our operating revenues in 2011. Based on our current estimates, we believe these items in the aggregate will reduce network access r evenues approximately $160 180 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. Other revenues. We derive other revenues primarily by (i) providing fiber transport, CLEC and security monitoring services; (ii) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise telecommunications equipment and wiring; (iii) providing payphone services primarily within our local service territories and various correctional facilities around the country; (iv) participating in the publication of local directories, which allows us to share in revenues generated by the sale of yellow page and related advertising to businesses; (v) providing network database services; and (vi) providing certain other new product and service offerings. Other revenues increased $239.5 million in 2010 due to $272.1 million of additional revenues attributable to Embarq.&#1 60; Excluding Embarq, other revenues decreased $32.7 million primarily due to a $20.8 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions as a result of the discontinuance of regulatory accounting, a $7.1 million decrease in directory revenues and a $5.5 million decrease in certain non regulated product sales and service offerings. 62 Other revenues increased $294.4 million in 2009, of which approximately $326.5 million related to our acquisition of Embarq. Excluding Embarq, other revenues decreased $32.1 million primarily as a result of a $22.0 million reduction due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a $10.5 million decrease in certain non regulated product sales and service offerings. OPERATING EXPENSES Year ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Dollars in thousands) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 2,410,048 1,752,087 955,473 Selling, general and administrative 1,137,989 1,014,341 399,136 Depreciation and amortization 1,433,553 974,710 523,786 Operating expenses $ 4,981,590 3,741,138 1,878,395 Cost of services and products. Cost of services and products increased $658.0 million (37.6%) in 2010 primarily due to a $758.2 million increase in expenses incurred by Embarq (which includes approximately $36.6 million of integration costs and an incremental $8.0 million of costs associated with employee severance benefits and is partially offset by a curtailment gain of approximately $5.9 million associated with freezing certain future benefit accruals related to our defined benefit pension plans). The remaining $100.3 million decrease is primarily due to (i) an $89.4 million reduction in expenses resulting from the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting; (ii) a $13.1 million decrease i n access expense and (iii) a $10.4 million decrease in transport costs associated with our long distance operations. Cost of services and products increased $796.6 million (83.4%) in 2009 primarily due to $888.8 million of expenses attributable to the Embarq properties acquired on July 1, 2009. The remaining $92.2 million decrease is primarily due to (i) a $88.7 million reduction in expenses resulting from the elimination of all intercompany transactions resulting from the discontinuance of regulatory accounting; (ii) a $4.9 million decrease in customer service related expenses; (iii) a $4.6 million decrease in access expense; and (iv) a $4.1 million decrease in CLEC expenses as a result of the divestiture of six CLEC markets in 2008. Such decreases were partially offset by a $15.8 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits primarily due to increases in pension expense and share based compensation expense and a $12.4 milli on increase in DSL related expenses due to an increase in the number of DSL customers served. Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $123.6 million in 2010 primarily due to a $170.4 million increase in expenses incurred by Embarq. The $170.4 million increase is net of (i) a $98.0 million reduction of severance costs and accelerated recognition of share based compensation and pension costs due to workforce reductions incurred during 2010 as compared to similar expenses incurred during 2009; (ii) $47.2 million of transaction related costs incurred in 2009 related to the Embarq acquisition; (iii) a $31.4 million reduction in integration costs related to our acquisition of Embarq and (iv) a 2010 curtailment gain of approximately $15.0 million associated with freezing certain future defined benefit pension accruals. During 2010, we also incurred approximately $22.3 million of transaction and other costs associated with our pending acquisition of Qwest. Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $31.5 million reduction in salaries and benefits (which includes $16.6 million of one time charges related to a supplemental executive pension plan in 2009); (ii) a $17.4 million decrease in legal costs, and (iii) a $14.9 million reduction in expenses due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. 63 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $615.2 million in 2009 primarily due to $500.6 million of expenses attributable to operating Embarq for the second half of 2009 (which includes approximately $106.0 million of costs associated with employee termination benefits, primarily due to severance and retention benefits, contractual pension benefits and acceleration of share based compensation expense associated with Embarq employee terminations). The remaining $114.6 million increase is primarily due to (i) $86.4 million of integration costs associated with our acquisition of Embarq, primarily related to system conversion efforts; (ii) $47.2 million of transaction related merger costs, including investment banker and legal fees associated with our acquisition of Embarq; and (iii) $13.8 million of higher employee benefit costs, primarily due to higher pension expense (primarily due to accelerated expense recognition due to change of control provisions triggered upon our acquisition of Embarq and the termination of a supplemental executive retirement plan) and share based compensation expense (due to the accelerated vesting of equity grants of our employees upon the acquisition of Embarq). Such increases were partially offset by (i) a $19.5 million reduction in expenses resulting from the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting; (ii) a $10.7 million reduction in operating taxes primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain transaction tax audit issues; and (iii) an $8.1 million reduction in marketing expenses. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $458.8 million in 2010 primarily due to $480.8 million of additional depreciation and amortization attributable to Embarq (including $69.3 million of additional amortization expense related to the customer list and other intangible assets acquired in connection with the Embarq transaction) and a $22.4 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service in our legacy markets. The remaining decrease was primarily due to a $19.1 million decrease in depreciation expense due to a change in certain depreciation rates effective July 1, 2009 upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a $24.5 million decrease due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization increased $450.9 million in 2009 primarily due to $492.6 million of depreciation and amortization attributable to Embarq (including $118.4 million of amortization expense related to its customer list and other intangible assets). The remaining $41.7 million decrease was primarily due to a $59.8 million decrease in depreciation expense resulting from a reduction in certain depreciation rates effective July 1, 2009 upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting (see Note 16) and due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Such decreases were partially offset by an $18.8 million increase due to higher levels of plant placed in service in our incumbent markets. 64 Other. For additional information regarding certain matters that have impacted or may impact our operations, see Regulation and Competition. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased $187.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to interest expense attributable to Embarqs indebtedness assumed in connection with our acquisition of Embarq. Interest expense increased $168.2 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to $179.9 million of interest expense attributable to Embarqs indebtedness assumed in connection with our acquisition of Embarq. The remaining $11.7 million decrease is primarily attributable to a $4.6 million decrease in interest expense due to favorable resolution of certain transaction tax audit issues and a $4.7 million one time reduction in interest expense in 2009 related to debt extinguishment transactions consummated in October 2009. See Note 6 for additional information. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) Other income (expense) includes the effects of certain items not directly related to our core operations, including gains or losses from nonoperating asset dispositions and impairments, our share of the income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income and allowance for funds used during construction. Other income (expense) was $29.6 million for 2010 compared to $(48.2) million for 2009 and $42.3 million in 2008. Included in 2009 is (i) a $72.0 million pre tax charge related to certain debt extinguishment transactions consummated in October 2009 (see Note 6 for additional information) and (ii) an $8.0 million pre tax charge associated with terminating our $800 million bridge credit facility (see Note 2 for additional information). Included in 2008 is (i) approximately $10.0 million related to the recognition of previously accrued transaction related and other contingencies; (ii) a pre tax gain of $4.5 million upon the liquidation of our investments in marketable securities in our SERP trust; (iii) a pre tax gain of approximately $7.3 million from the sales of certain nonoperating investments; and (iv) a $3.4 million pre tax charge related to terminating all of our existing derivative instruments in the first quarter of 2008. &#160 ;Our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership decreased $2.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009 and increased $7.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008. We record our share of the partnership income based on unaudited results of operations until the time we receive audited financial statements for the partnership from the unaffiliated general partner. In 2008, we recorded unfavorable adjustments upon receipt of the partnerships audited financial statements for 2007. 65 INCOME TAX EXPENSE The effective income tax rate was 38.1%, 37.2%, and 34.7% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Certain executive compensation amounts, including the lump sum distributions paid to certain executive officers in connection with discontinuing the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (see Note 12), are reflected as non deductible for income tax purposes pursuant to executive compensation limitations prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. Our inability to deduct these amounts resulted in the recognition of approximately $3.3 million and $9.8 million of income tax expense in 2010 and 2009 above amounts that would have been recognized had such payments been deductible for income tax purposes. Our 2010 and 2009 effective tax rate is also higher because a portion of our merger related transaction costs incurred during those years are non deductible for income tax purposes (with such treatment resulting in a $3.9 million and $7.4 million increase to income tax expense in 2010 and 2009, respectively). In 2009, such increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by a $7.0 million reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. Income tax expense was reduced by approximately $15.7 million in 2009 and $12.8 million in 2008 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits (see Critical Accounting Policies below and Note 13) and other adjustments upon finalization of tax returns. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM Upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting on July 1, 2009, we recorded a one time extraordinary gain of approximately $136.0 million after tax. See Note 16 for additional information related to this extraordinary gain. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board updated the accounting standard regarding revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements, such as the service bundles that we offer to our customers. This update requires the use of the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in these types of arrangements. This method allows a vendor to use its best estimate of selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists when evaluating multiple deliverable arrangements. This standard update is effective January 1, 2011 and may be adopted prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or retrospectively for all revenue arrangements for all periods presented. We currently do not expect this standard update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are subject to certain accounting standards that define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures about fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements. The fair value accounting guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. These tiers include: Level 1 (defined as observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets), Level 2 (defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable), and Level 3 (defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists). See Note 19 for additional information. In January 2010, we adopted the accounting standard update regardin g fair value measurements and disclosures, which requires additional disclosures and explanations for transfers of financial assets and liabilities between certain levels in the fair value hierarchy. The adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 66 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to (i) revenue recognition, (ii) allowance for doubtful accounts, (iii) pension and postretirement benefits, (iv) intangible and long lived assets, (v) depreciation and amortization of long lived assets; (vi) business combinations and (vii) income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions and these differences may be material. We believe these criti cal accounting policies discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity. Revenue recognition. We collect in advance fees for fixed rate services, such as local service, unlimited long distance, high speed Internet and certain data services, and defer revenue recognition until these services are provided to the customer. We bill in arrears variable rate billing services, including usage based long distance, data and access revenues. We have multiple billing cycles spread throughout each month resulting in accounts receivables and deferred revenue balances at the end of each reporting period. In the event that the variable rate usage data is not available at the end of a reporting period, we estimate revenue based on historic usage and other relevant factors. Service activation and instal lation fees are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over our average customer lives. Operating revenues include certain revenue reserves for billing disputes and contract interpretations. These reserves require managements judgment and are based on many factors including historical trends, contract and tariff interpretations and developments during the resolution process. Allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the failure of our customers to make required payments. In evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific customers or carriers ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience. Based on these assessments, we record both specific and general reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable to reduce the related accounts receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers and carriers. Our reserves for account s receivable generally increase as the receivable ages. If circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, we may need to increase our reserves from the levels reflected in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 67 Pension and postretirement benefits. Accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the time period each employee provides service to us. To accomplish this, extensive use is made of various assumptions, such as discount rates, investment returns, mortality, turnover, medical costs and inflation through a collaborative effort by management and independent actuaries. These efforts are designed to provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgment and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements. Changes in assumptions used could result in a material impact to our financial results in any given period. Our actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in Notes 11 and 12. A significant assumption used in determining our pension and postretirement expense is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets. For 2010 and 2009, we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 8.25% for our incumbent pension plan and 8.50% for the pension plan we assumed in connection with the Embarq acquisition. In setting the long term assumed rate of return, management considers capital markets future expectations and the asset mix of the plans investments. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, a 50 basis point decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would cause combined pension and postretirement cost to increase by approximately $18 million. Should we experience asset returns that are significantly below our long term rate o f return assumptions, we may experience in the future higher levels of pension expense, higher levels of required contributions and lower stockholders equity balances (due to accumulated other comprehensive losses). For 2011, we are reducing our long term assumed rate of return assumption to 7.5% for our legacy CenturyLink pension plan and 8.0% for our legacy Embarq pension plan. Such reduction in our assumed rate of asset return is primarily due to lower prevailing bond yields. Another assumption used in the determination of our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations is the appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is an assumed rate of return derived from high quality debt securities that, if applicable at the measurement date to a specified amount of principal, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay our pension benefit obligations when they become due. For our pension plan, the discount rate used for the December 31, 2010 measurement date was derived by matching projected benefit payments to bond yields obtained from a hypothetical yield curve from Aa rated corporate bonds. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we utilized a similar process using as a reference the CitiGroup Pension Discount Curve (Above Median) to derive our discount ra te. Our discount rate for determining benefit obligations under our pension plans at December 31, 2010 ranged from 5.0 to 5.5% compared to 5.5 to 6.0% at December 31, 2009. The discount rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that impact corporate bond yields. We use a similar methodology to determine the discount rate for our postretirement plan by utilizing as a reference the Hewitt Top Quartile Yield Curve as of the end of the year. Our discount rate for determining benefit obligations under our postretirement plans at December 31, 2010 was 5.30% compared to 5.70 5.80% at December 31, 2009. We estimate that a 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our combined pension and postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $148 million. 68 Intangible and long lived assets. We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets (including goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets) based on applicable accounting guidelines. We are required to review goodwill recorded in business combinations for impairment at least annually and are required to write down the value of goodwill only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. As disclosed in the table below, substantially all of our goodwill is associated with our local exchange telephone operations. Subsequent to our acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009, we have managed our local exchange telephone operations based on five geographic regions (which we internally refer to as Mid Atlantic, Southern, South Central, Northeast and Western) and have considered these five operating regions to be our reporting units in testing for goodwill impairment of our telephone operations. The remainder of our goodwill is associated with our competitive local ex change carrier (CLEC), fiber transport, security monitoring and other operations of our business, all of which we treat as separate reporting units in our goodwill impairment testing. The breakdown of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2010 by reporting unit is as follows (amounts in thousands): Telephone operations (Mid Atlantic) $ 2,227,596 Telephone operations (Southern) 2,297,064 Telephone operations (South Central) 2,487,536 Telephone operations (Northeast) 2,252,288 Telephone operations (Western) 946,367 CLEC operations 29,935 Fiber transport operations 10,607 Security monitoring operations 4,966 All other operations 4,281 Total goodwill $ 10,260,640 We estimate the fair value of our telephone operations reporting units using multiples of earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA). For each telephone reporting unit, we compare its estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. The multiple of EBITDA we utilize in our goodwill impairment testing for our telephone operations is supported by an independent valuation analysis performed by a major investment banking firm. For the past several years, we have utilized EBITDA multiples derived from comparable independent analysis. The EBITDA multiple derived in the independent reports and utilized in our goodwill impairment testing was 5.8 in 2010, 5.6 in 2009 and 6.5 in 2008. We believe the decline in EBITDA multiples since 2008 is primarily due to, among other factors, the continued erosion of access lines. 69 We estimate the fair value of our other reporting units using various methods, including multiples of EBITDA (as described above) and multiples of revenues. As of September 30, 2010, we completed the required annual test of goodwill impairment and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of that date. However, as of that date, the estimated fair value of the Southern region exceeded its carrying value by less than 10%. Should events occur (such as continued access line losses or other revenue reductions) that would cause the fair value to decline below its carrying value, we may be required to record a non cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined. The carrying value of long lived assets other than goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amount cannot be recoverable by assessing the recoverability of the carrying value through estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If the undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying value of a long lived asset over its fair value. Depreciation and amortization of long lived assets. Our depreciation of property, plant and equipment, including the use of group depreciation for our telephone operations and estimates of useful lives, is discussed in Note 1. We assign useful lives based on annual studies of actual asset lives, taking into account actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution and access line losses. No significant changes to our remaining useful lives occurred as a result of our study performed in 2010. We also have significant customer list intangible assets, the vast majority of which is attributable to our July 1, 2009 Embarq acquisition. The customer list intangible assets from our Embarq acquisition are finite lived intangible assets and are amortized using an accelerated method over the period in which those relationships are expected to contribute to our future cash flows. The accelerated method employed is a process of allocation which reflects our belief that we expect greater revenue generation from these customer relationships during the earlier years of their lives. Amortization of other intangible assets is determined using the straight line method of amortization over the expected remaining useful lives. We periodically evaluate our intangible assets to insure that our current amortization method and remaining useful lives are appropriate. Business combinations. The new accounting guidance for business combinations was effective for us for all business combinations consummated on or after January 1, 2009 and requires an acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Embarq (and the related estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets) was finalized during 2010 at the end of the one year measurement period and required a significant amount of judgment. Such allocation of certain aspects of the purchase price to items that are more complex to value was performed by an independent valuation firm based on in formation provided by management. See Note 2 for additional information concerning the assignment of fair values to the assets and assumed liabilities of Embarq. We will similarly assign fair values to the assets and liabilities acquired from our pending acquisition of Qwest, which we expect to close during 2011. 70 Income taxes. We estimate our current and deferred income taxes based on our assessment of the future tax consequences of transactions that have been reflected in our financial statements or applicable tax returns. Actual income taxes paid could vary from these estimates due to several factors, including future changes in income tax law or the resolution of audits by federal and state taxing authorities. We maintain liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in our tax returns. These liabilities are estimated based on our judgment of the probable outcome of the uncertain tax positions and are adjusted periodically based on changing facts and circumstances. Changes to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could materially affect operating results in the period of change. During 2009 and 2008, we recognized approximately $15.7 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of previously unrecognized tax benefits (including related interest and net of federal tax benefit) and other adjustments upon finalization of tax returns. Such benefits were recorded primarily as a result of the favorable resolution of audits, administrative practices and the lapse of statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions. See Note 13 for additional information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits. For additional information on our critical accounting policies, see Accounting Pronouncements and Regulation and Competition Other Matters below, and the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt obligations. We have estimated our market risk using sensitivity analysis. Market risk is defined as the potential change in the fair value of a fixed rate debt obligation due to a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates. We determine fair value of long term debt obligations based on a discounted cash flow analysis, using the rates and maturities of these obligations compared to terms and rates currently available in the long term financing ma rkets. The results of the sensitivity analysis used to estimate market risk are presented below, although the actual results may differ from these estimates. At December 31, 2010, we estimated the fair value of our long term debt to be $8.0 billion based on the overall weighted average interest rate of our debt of 7.0% and an overall weighted maturity of 11 years compared to terms and rates currently available in long term financing markets. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 95% of our long term debt obligations were fixed rate. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of 70 basis points in prevailing interest rates (ten percent of our overall weighted average borrowing rate). Such an increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $331.9 million decrease in the fair value o f our fixed rate long term debt at December 31, 2010, but would have no impact on our interest expense or cash flows. A 100 basis point increase in prevailing variable interest rates would have had a negative pre tax impact of approximately $1.7 million on our results of operations and cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, but would have no impact on the fair value of our long term variable rate debt. 71 From time to time over the past several years, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. Currently, we have no derivative instruments in place. We are also exposed to market risk from changes in the fair value of our pension plan assets. The pension plan we assumed in connection with the Embarq acquisition was underfunded by approximately $667 million with respect to the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010. We contributed $300 million and $115 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan during 2010 and the last half of 2009, respectively. We currently expect to contribute approximately $100 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan in 2011. Based on current actuarial estimates as of December 31, 2010 that assume a $100 million contribution in 2011 and the utilization of our existing remaining credit balance to partially satisfy future requ ired cash contributions, our estimated future contributions for the 2012 2014 time period ranges from approximately $75 185 million per year for all of our pension plans. The actual level of contributions required in future years can change significantly depending on discount rates and actual returns on plan assets. See Critical Accounting Policies Pension and Postretirement Benefits Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of fair value of financial instruments. Actual values may differ from those presented if market conditions vary from assumptions used in the fair value calculations. The analysis above incorporates only those risk exposures that existed as of December 31, 2010. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we rely on cash provided by operations to fund our operating and capital expenditures as well as our dividend payments. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow which has helped us continue our long term program of capital improvements. 72 Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.045 billion, $1.574 billion and $853.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Payments for income taxes aggregated $431.7 million, $258.9 million and $208.8 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2009, we paid approximately $54 million to fund lump sum distributions under our frozen supplemental executive retirement plan upon the discontinuance of such plan and under change of control provisions triggered upon the acquisition of Embarq. We also contributed $300 million and $115 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan during 2010 and the last half of 2009, respectively.&#16 0; Our accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows identify major differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities for each of these periods. For additional information relating to our operations, see Results of Operations above. Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $859.1 million, $678.8 million and $389.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Payments for property, plant and equipment were $863.8 million in 2010, $754.5 million in 2009 (which includes $396.1 million of capital expenditures attributable to our Embarq operations subsequent to our July 1, 2009 acquisition of Embarq) and $286.8 million in 2008. Capital expenditures for 2010 and 2009 include approximately $29.0 million and $75.1 million, respectively, of one time capital expenditures related to the integration of Embarq.& #160; On July 1, 2009, we consummated the acquisition of Embarq Corporation by issuing approximately $6.0 billion of CenturyLink common stock (valued as of June 30, 2009). We financed our merger transaction expenses with (i) available cash of the combined company and (ii) proceeds from CenturyLinks and Embarqs existing revolving credit facilities. We acquired $76.9 million of cash in connection with our acquisition of Embarq. During 2008, we paid an aggregate of approximately $149 million for 69 licenses in the FCCs auction of 700 megahertz wireless spectrum. Our plan has been to use the spectrum to develop wireless voice and data service capabilities in our markets, built upon LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology. The LTE network deployment plans of larger wireless carriers are driving most vendor activity, including the availability of handsets and other end user devices. Therefore, we are monitoring their deployment efforts to help shape our plans for moving forward. In anticipation of making lump sum distributions to certain participants of our SERP in early 2009, we liquidated our investments in marketable securities in the SERP trust during the second quarter of 2008 and thereby increased our cash and cash equivalents by $34.9 million. As noted above, the lump sum distributions were paid in 2009 and aggregated approximately $54 million. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.175 billion during 2010, $976.4 million during 2009 and $255.4 million in 2008. In October 2010, we repaid our $482.5 million Series H Senior Notes at its scheduled maturity using borrowings under our existing credit facility. In September 2009, we received net proceeds of $644.4 million from the issuance of $250 million of 10 year, 6.15% senior notes and $400 million of 30 year, 7.6% senior notes. In October 2009, the proceeds from these note offerings, along with additional borrowings under our existing credit faci lity, were used to repurchase an aggregate of $746.1 million of CenturyLink, Inc. and Embarq indebtedness (see Note 6 for additional information). During 2008, we paid our $240 million Series F Senior Notes at maturity primarily using borrowings from our credit facility. 73 In June 2008, our Board of Directors (i) increased our annual cash dividend to $2.80 from $.27 per share and (ii) declared a one time dividend of $.6325 per share, which was paid in July 2008, effectively adjusting the total second quarter dividend to the new $.70 quarterly dividend rate. In February 2010, our Board of Directors further increased our quarterly dividend to $.725 per share. We paid dividends of $878.0 million in 2010, $560.7 million in 2009 and $220.3 million in 2008. Such increase is primarily attributable to the dividend rate increases mentioned above and the substantial increase in shares outstanding as a result of the common stock issued in connection with our Embarq acquisition on July 1, 2009. Based on curr ent circumstances, we intend to continue our current dividend practice, subject to any other factors that our Board in its discretion deems relevant. In accordance with previously announced stock repurchase programs, we repurchased 9.7 million shares (for $347.3 million) in 2008. As of December 31, 2010, we had available two unsecured revolving credit facilities, (i) a five year, $750 million facility of CenturyLink and (ii) an $800 million facility of Embarq. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $365.0 million outstanding under these credit facilities (all of which related to CenturyLinks facility). In January 2011, we entered into a new four year revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to $1.0 billion initially with the total capacity of the credit facility increasing to $1.7 billion upon the consummation of our pending acquisition of Qwest. Up to $400 million of this new credit facility can be used for letters of credit. Interest will be assessed on future borrowings using the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin between .5% and 2.5% per annum depending on the type of loan and our then current senior unsecured long term debt rating. Upon the execution of the new credit facility, the two credit facilities mentioned above were terminated. As of February 28, 2011, we had $28 0 million outstanding under the new credit facility. For additional information regarding our new credit facility, see Note 22. As was the case with our predecessor credit facilities, (i) outstanding letters of credit directly reduce the amount available for other extensions of credit under our new credit facility and (ii) outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program, which effectively cannot exceed the amount available under our new facility, effectively have the same result on our borrowing capacity under the new facility. As of February 28, 2011, approximately $61 million of letters of credit were outstanding and no amounts were outstanding under our commercial paper program. 74 Other. For 2011, we have budgeted approximately $1.0 billion for capital expenditures (excluding any capital related to the integration of the Embarq acquisition or the pending Qwest acquisition). Such increase over the $863.8 million of capital expenditures in 2010 is due to our planned incremental fiber to the tower investment in 2011. Our 2011 capital expenditure budget also includes amounts for expanding our new service offerings and our da ta networks. We currently expect aggregate integration related capital expenditures associated with our pending Qwest acquisition will approximate $200 million over the next two years. The pension plan we assumed in our acquisition of Embarq was approximately $667 million underfunded as compared to the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010. If this underfunded status continues, we may be required to contribute additional funds to our pension plan in the near future. To reduce the underfunded position, in March 2010 we contributed $300 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan using cash on hand and borrowings from our credit facility. We currently expect to contribute approximately $100 million to the legacy Embarq pension plan in 2011. For further information, see Item 1A Risk Factors, of this annual report. The following table contains certain information concerning our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010. Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 After 2015 and Other (Dollars in thousands) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations (1) $ 7,327,587 376,583 1,146,064 381,794 5,423,146 Interest on long term debt obligations $ 6,175,641 506,858 946,277 834,095 3,888,411 Unrecognized tax benefits (2) $ 76,997 76,997 (1) For additional information on the terms of our outstanding debt instruments, see Note 6. (2) Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay assuming we are required to pay the entire amount that we have reserved for our unrecognized tax benefits (see Note 13 for additional information). The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the After 2015 and Other column in the above table. We continually evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional communications operations and expect to continue our long term strategy of pursuing the acquisition of attractively priced communications properties in exchange for cash, securities or both. At any given time, we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. We may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions, the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations. Approximately 4.1 million shares of our common stock and 200,000 shares of our preferred stock remain available for future issuance in connection with acquisitio ns under our acquisition shelf registration statement. We also have access to debt and equity capital markets. 75 Following our announcement of our pending acquisition of Qwest, (i) Standard & Poors indicated that our current long term debt rating of BBB had been placed under watch for a possible downgrade; (ii) Moodys Investors Service affirmed our current long term debt rating of Baa3, but downgraded its outlook from stable to negative; and (iii) Fitch Ratings has rated our long term debt BBB with a negative watch. It is expected that any downgrades would be made only following the completion of the Qwest acquisition. Our commercial paper program is rated P 3 by Moodys and A 3 by S&P. Any downgrade in our credit ratings will increase our borrowing costs and commitment fees under our new revolving credit facility. Downgrades could also restrict o ur access to the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs under new or replacement debt financings, or otherwise adversely affect the terms of future borrowings by, among other things, increasing the scope of our debt covenants and decreasing our financial or operating flexibility. The following table reflects our debt to total capitalization percentage and ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The debt to total capitalization ratio for 2010 and 2009 reflects our Embarq acquisition. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends calculation for 2009 reflects the operations of Embarq only since July 1, 2009. 2010 2009 2008 Debt to total capitalization 43.2 % 45.0 51.2 Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends* 3.74 3.20 3.78 * For purposes of the chart above, earnings consist of income before income taxes (before extraordinary item) and fixed charges, and fixed charges include our interest expense, including amortized debt issuance costs, and our preferred stock dividend costs. Our debt to capitalization percentage will increase upon acquiring Qwest, which has $11.947 billion of long term debt at December 31, 2010. 76 REGULATION AND COMPETITION The communications industry continues to undergo various fundamental regulatory, legislative, competitive and technological changes. These changes may have a significant impact on the future financial performance of all communications companies. Events affecting the communications industry. Wireless telephone services increasingly constitute a significant source of competition with ILEC services, especially since wireless carriers have begun to compete effectively on the basis of price with more traditional telephone services. Similarly, the growing prevalence of electronic mail, text messaging, social networking, and similar digital communications continue to reduce the demand for traditional landline voice services. We anticipate these trends will continue. Federal USF programs have undergone substantial changes since 1997, and are expected to experience more changes in the coming years. Since May 2001, the FCC has administered its existing universal service support programs for rural telephone companies based on embedded, or historical, costs. The FCC, in April 2010, proposed to replace the USF with a broadband Connect America fund that would modernize the current voice only funding mechanism and direct funding away from local voice services to advance broadband deployment in areas unserved or underserved by broadband communications, and in February 2011 sought public comments regarding cr eating this new broadband fund. These developments have placed additional financial pressure on the amount of money that is necessary and available to provide support to all eligible service providers, including payments we receive from the USF High Cost Loop program. Increases in the nationwide average cost per loop factor used to allocate funds among all USF recipients caused our revenues from the USF High Cost Loop program (excluding the effects of the additional six months of receipts recorded in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the July 1, 2009 acquisition of Embarq) to decrease in 2010 when compared to 2009. We anticipate that such revenues will continue to decline in 2011. See Item 7 of Part II of this annual report for more information. Technological developments have led to the development of new services that compete with traditional ILEC services. Technological improvements have enabled cable television companies to provide alternatives to traditional circuit switched telephone service over their cable networks, and several national cable companies have aggressively pursued this opportunity. Improvements in the quality of VoIP service have led several cable, Internet, data and other communications companies, as well as start up companies, to substantially increase their offerings of VoIP service to business and residential customers. VoIP providers frequently offer features that cannot readily be provided by traditional ILECs and may price their services at o r below those prices currently charged for traditional local and long distance telephone services. Although over the past several years the FCC has increasingly subjected portions of VoIP operations to federal regulation, VoIP services currently operate under fewer regulatory constraints than LEC services. For all these reasons, we cannot assure you that VoIP providers will not successfully compete for our customers. Beginning in 2003, the FCC initiated a series of broad intercarrier compensation proceedings designed to create a uniform mechanism to be used by the entire telecommunications industry for payments between carriers originating, terminating, or carrying telecommunications traffic. In connection therewith, the FCC has received intercarrier compensation proposals from several industry groups, and solicited public comments on a variety of topics related to access charges and intercarrier compensation. Most recently, on February 8, 2011, the FCC sought comments from the public on proposals designed to lower intercarrier compensation rates. The ultimate outcom e of the FCCs intercarrier compensation proceedings could change the way we receive compensation from, and remit compensation to, other carriers, our end user customers and the USF. As discussed further in Item 1A of this annual report, these changes could substantially reduce the amount of revenues we receive with respect to various services. 77 During 2010, the FCC released its National Broadband Plan and adopted an order imposing network neutrality rules governing Internet services, both of which are discussed in further detail in Item 1 of this annual report. As discussed further in such item, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, but believe that these and other FCC initiatives could have a material impact on our operations and those of other communications companies. Many cable, technology or other communication companies that previously offered a limited range of services are now, like us, offering diversified bundles of services. As such, a growing number of companies are competing to serve the communications needs of the same customer base. Several of these companies may be able to provide more comprehensive or less costly service bundles than ours. Such activities will continue to place downward pressure on the demand for our access lines. Recent events affecting us. During the last few years, most of the states in which we provide telephone services have taken legislative or regulatory steps to further introduce competition into the ILEC business. At the state level, we are responding to carrier complaints, legislation or generic investigations regarding our intrastate switched access rate levels in several of our states. Although outcomes cannot be determined at this time, we believe our intrastate switched access rate levels are appropriate and we vigorously plan to defend them. If we are required to reduce our intrastate switched access rates as a result of any of these initiatives, we will seek to recover displaced switched access revenues from state universal service funds or other services. However, the amount of such recovery, if any, is not assured. Over the past few years, each of the FCC, Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) and certain Congressional committees has initiated wide ranging reviews of the administration of the federal USF. As part of this process, we, along with a number of other USF recipients, have undergone a number of USF audits and have also received requests for information from the FCCs Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Congressional committees. In addition, in July 2008 we received a subpoena from the OIG requesting a broad range of information regarding our deprec iation rates and methodologies since 2000, and in July 2009 we received a second subpoena requesting information about our participation in the E rate program for Wisconsin schools and libraries since 2004. The OIG has not identified to us any specific issues with respect to our participation in the USF program and all USAC audits are finalized with no material issued reported regarding our participation in the USF program. During 2010, USAC moved from the audit process to a Payment Quality Assessment (PQA) program. We continue to receive and respond to these PQAs and to date no material issues have been identified. While we believe our participation is in compliance with FCC rules and in accordance with accepted industry practices, we cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of these various reviews. 78 Excluding our pending acquisition of Qwest, we expect our operating revenues in 2011 to decline from 2010 levels as we continue to experience downward pressure primarily due to continued access line losses, reduced universal service funding and lower network access revenues. We expect such revenue declines to be partially offset primarily due to increased demand for our high speed Internet service offering and special access services. For a more complete description of regulation and competition impacting our operations and various attendant risks, please see Items 1 and 1A of this annual report. Other matters. Through June 30, 2009, CenturyLink accounted for its regulated telephone operations (except for the properties acquired from Verizon in 2002) in accordance with the provisions of codification ASC 980 10 (formerly SFAS 71) which addresses regulatory accounting under which actions by regulators can provide reasonable assurance of the recognition of an asset, reduce or eliminate the value of an asset and impose a liability on a regulated enterprise. On July 1, 2009, we discontinued the accounting requirements of regulatory accounting upon the conversion of substantially all of our rate of ret urn study areas to federal price cap regulation (based on the FCCs approval of our petition to convert our study areas to price cap regulation). In the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a net non cash extraordinary after tax gain of approximately $136.0 million upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. See Note 16 for additional information. We have certain obligations based on federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. Costs of compliance through 2010 have not been material, and we currently do not believe that such costs will become material. Item 7A.
