ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS All references to "Notes" in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this annual report. Certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" in Item 1 of this report for factors relating to these statements and see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Overview We are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential, business, governmental and wholesale customers. Our communications services include local and long distance, network access, private line (including special access), public access, broadband, data, managed hosting (including cloud hosting), colocation, wireless and video services. In certain local and regional markets, we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers and security monitoring. We strive to maintain our customer relationships by, among other things, bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services. At December 31, 2011, we operated 14.584 million access lines in 37 states, and served 5.554 million broadband subscribers. During 2011, we updated our methodology for counting access lines and broadband subscribers. Our access line methodology includes only those access lines that we use to provide services to external customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates. Our methodology also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand alone broadband subscribers. Our methodology for counting access lines may not be comparable to those of other companies. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyLink, Inc. ("CenturyLink") and its majority owned subsidiaries. These subsidiaries include SAVVIS, Inc. ("Savvis") as of July 15, 2011, Qwest Communications International Inc. ("Qwest") as of April 1, 2011 and Embarq Corporation ("Embarq") as of July 1, 2009 (See Note 2 Acquisitions). Due to the significant size of these acquisitions, direct comparisons of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are less meaningful than usual. We discuss below, under "Segment Results", certain trends that we believe are significant, even if they are not necessarily material to the combined company. In the discussion that follows, we refer to the business that we operated prior to the Qwest acquisition (including Embarqs business) as "Legacy CenturyLink" and refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Savvis acquisition as "Legacy Savvis" and the Qwest acquisition as "Legacy Qwest." Due to the magnitude of our recent acquisitions in relation to Legacy CenturyLink operations, in the combined company variance discussions below we have separately reflected the impacts of both the Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis operations for enhanced visibility, although we actively manage the combined company through our four segments, as discussed further below. We have incurred operating expenses related to our acquisitions of Savvis in July 2011, Qwest in April 2011 and Embarq in July 2009. These expenses are reflected in cost of services and products and 45 Table of Contents selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as summarized below. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Cost of services and products: Integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions $ 43 37 Severance expenses, accelerated recognition of share based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions 24 12 6 $ 67 49 6 Selling, general and administrative: Expenses incurred to effect acquisitions $ 79 13 65 Integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions 172 64 86 Severance expenses, accelerated recognition of share based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions 149 19 114 $ 400 96 265 This table does not include costs incurred by Qwest or Savvis prior to being acquired by us. Based on current plans and information, we estimate that, in relation to our Qwest acquisition, we will incur approximately $800 million to $1 billion of operating expenses associated with transaction and integration costs (which includes approximately $393 million of the expenses noted above) and approximately $200 million of capital expenditures associated with integration activities (which includes approximately $24 million of capital expenditures incurred through December 31, 2011). Upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting effective July 1, 2009, we recorded a one time, non cash extraordinary gain that aggregated approximately $217 million before income tax expense ($136 million after tax). See Note 14 Discontinuance of Regulatory Accounting for more information. For several years prior to 2011, we reported our operations as a single segment. In connection with our acquisitions of Savvis on July 15, 2011 and Qwest on April 1, 2011, we have reorganized our business into the following operating segments: Regional markets, which consists primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers, small to medium sized businesses and regional enterprise customers; Business markets, which consists primarily of providing products and services to enterprise and government customers; Wholesale markets, which consists primarily of providing products and services to other communications providers; and Savvis operations, which consists primarily of providing hosting and network services primarily to business customers provided by Legacy Savvis. The business markets segment currently provides some of the same services as our Savvis operations segment, and we may reclassify in the future the revenues and expenses associated with those services as part of our Savvis operations segment. We will continue to classify those services as part of the business markets segment until we are able to further integrate Legacy Savvis. 46 Table of Contents Due to system limitations, it is impracticable to report 2009 segment information using our current segment view. As such, only 2010 financial data has been revised under our new segment structure described above. We now report financial information separately for each of these segments; however, our segment information does not include capital expenditures, total assets, or certain revenues and expenses that we manage on a centralized basis. As we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions, we may make further changes to the way we assess performance and make decisions about allocating resources, which could change our segment reporting. Our segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that our segments would have achieved had they operated as stand alone entities during the periods presented. For additional information about our segments, see Note 13 Segment Information and "Results of Operations Segment Results" below. Results of Operations The following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, presented in a manner that we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends affecting our business. Our operating results include operations of Savvis for periods after July 15, 2011, Qwest for periods after April 1, 2011 and Embarq for periods after July 1, 2009. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions except per share amounts) Operating revenues $ 15,351 7,042 4,974 Operating expenses 13,326 4,982 3,741 Operating income 2,025 2,060 1,233 Other income (expense) (1,077 ) (529 ) (420 ) Income tax expense 375 583 302 Extraordinary item, net of income tax expense 136 Net income $ 573 948 647 Employees 49,200 20,300 20,200 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Before extraordinary item $ 1.07 3.13 2.55 Extraordinary item .68 Basic and diluted earnings per common share $ 1.07 3.13 3.23 The lower levels of net income in 2011 were primarily attributable to the acquisition of Qwest as of April 1, 2011, which resulted in substantial acquisition, severance and integration expenses, as presented in the table under the "Overview" section above. Legacy Savvis and Legacy Qwests post acquisition operations, which included substantial severance and integration expenses and significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense based on preliminary valuation estimates (see Note 2 Acquisitions and Note 3 Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets), did not contribute significantly to our consolidated net income in 2011. Our current preliminary valuation estimates of our recently acquired assets and liabilities are subject to change as we finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair value, including those related to assets under capital leases, which may result in material changes to depreciation 47 Table of Contents expense. Within our Legacy CenturyLink business, growth in strategic services revenues (which we describe further below) did not fully offset lower revenues from other services and products, further contributing to the decreases in consolidated net income. Diluted earnings per common share in 2011 was substantially lower than the amounts for the corresponding periods of 2010 and 2009 due to decreases in net income, as well as increases in the weighted average number of outstanding common shares. The increase in outstanding shares during 2011 was primarily attributable to the issuance of 294 million shares in connection with the Qwest acquisition on April 1, 2011 and the issuance of 14.313 million shares in connection with the Savvis acquisition on July 15, 2011. The following table summarizes our broadband subscribers and access lines: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in thousands) Operational metrics: Broadband subscribers 5,554 2,349 2,186 Access lines 14,584 6,489 7,025 During the last several years, we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines, intrastate access rates and minutes of use. Prior to our acquisition, Qwest had experienced similar declines in its revenues. To mitigate these declines, we remain focused on efforts to, among other things: promote long term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services; provide new services, such as video, cloud hosting, managed hosting, colocation services and other additional services that may become available in the future due to advances in technology, wireless spectrum sales by the FCC or improvements in our infrastructure; provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers; pursue acquisitions of additional communications properties if available at attractive prices; increase usage of our networks; and market our products and services to new customers. Operating Revenues During 2011, we revised the way we categorize our products and services. We currently categorize our products, services and revenues among the following four categories: Strategic services, which include primarily private line (including special access which we market to business customers who require dedicated equipment to transmit large amounts of data between sites), broadband, hosting (including cloud hosting and managed hosting), colocation, multi protocol line switching ("MPLS") (which is a data networking technology that can deliver the quality of service required to support real time voice and video), video (including DIRECTV), voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") and Verizon Wireless services; Legacy services, which include primarily local, long distance, switched access, public access, integrated services digital network, ("ISDN") (which uses regular telephone lines to support voice, video and data applications), and traditional wide area network ("WAN") services (which allows a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations); 48 Table of Contents Data integration, which is telecommunications equipment we sell that is located on customers premises and related professional services, such as network management, installation and maintenance of data equipment and building of proprietary fiber optic broadband networks for our government and business customers; and Other revenues, which consists primarily of USF revenue and surcharges. We have revised our 2010 presentation of our products and services revenues to conform to our current categories for 2011. Due to system limitations, we have deemed it impracticable to report our 2011 revenue by our previous products and services, which were as follows: Voice, which included our local calling service to residential, business and wholesale customers within our local service areas, generally for a fixed monthly charge; Data, which included revenues primarily from monthly recurring charges for providing broadband access services, data transmission services over special circuits and private lines and switched digital television services; Network Access, which included revenues primarily from providing wholesale services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions as well as universal support funds and reciprocal compensation from CLECs and wireless service providers; and Other revenues, which included revenues from providing (i) fiber transport, CLEC and security monitoring services; (ii) leasing, selling, installing and maintaining customer premise equipment and wiring; (iii) providing payphone services; (iv) participating in the publication of local directories; (v) providing network database services and (vi) providing video services, as well as other new product and service offerings. The following table summarizes our operating revenues under our current revenue categorization: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Strategic services $ 6,254 2,049 150 3,572 483 4,205 Legacy services 7,680 4,288 (483 ) 3,875 3,392 Data integration 537 158 (23 ) 402 379 Other 880 547 (24 ) 357 333 Total operating revenues 15,351 7,042 (380 ) 8,206 483 8,309 49 Table of Contents For comparability purposes, we have included the former revenue categorization for 2010 and 2009: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 CenturyLink Embarq Total (Dollars in millions) Voice $ 3,138 2,168 (77 ) 1,047 970 Data 1,909 1,202 (28 ) 735 707 Network access 1,080 928 (96 ) 248 152 Other 915 676 (33 ) 272 239 Total operating revenues $ 7,042 4,974 (234 ) 2,302 2,068 Our operating revenues increased substantially in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to our acquisitions of Savvis and Qwest. Due to our acquisition of Embarq on July 1, 2009, our 2010 operating revenues reflect a full year of Embarqs results, as opposed to our 2009 operating revenues, which reflect only six months of Embarqs results. Total operating revenues increased $8.309 billion in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased $2.068 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our 2011 increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of Qwest, which contributed total operating revenues (net of intercompany eliminations) of $8.2 billion. Legacy CenturyLink operating revenues decreased $380 million, or 5.4%, in 2011 and $234 million, or 4.7%, in 2010 as compared to the prior year period. These decreases were primarily attributable to declines in legacy services revenues, which reflected the continuing loss of access lines in our markets. At December 31, 2011, we had 14.584 million access lines, of which 8.533 million were in Legacy Qwests markets. Access lines in our Legacy CenturyLink markets declined to 6.051 million at December 31, 2011 from 6.489 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of 6.75%, and were 7.025 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of 7.63%. We believe the decline in the number of access lines was primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services. We estimate that our access lines loss will be between 5.9% and 6.6% in 2012. Our legacy services revenues were also negatively impacted in 2011 by the continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at lower effective rates. The decreases in our legacy services revenues were partially offset by higher revenues from strategic services revenues. Broadband and private line services accounted for a majority of the growth in strategic services revenues. In 2010, total operating revenues decreased $104 million due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions upon the July 1, 2009 discontinuance of regulatory accounting. We are aggressively marketing our strategic services (including our data hosting services) and data integration to offset the continuing declines in our legacy services revenues. We believe our recent acquisitions of Savvis and Qwest will strengthen our ability to achieve this goal. Further analysis of our operating revenues by segment is provided below in "Segment Results." Operating Expenses As discussed in Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, during 2011 we changed the definitions we use to classify expenses as cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative, and have reclassified prior period amounts to conform to our new definitions. During 2011, our operating expenses increased substantially in comparison to 2010 primarily due to our acquisition of Qwest and Savvis. In addition, our operating expenses increased substantially in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to our acquisition of Embarq. 50 Table of Contents The following tables summarize our operating expenses: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 6,325 2,544 (4 ) 3,523 262 3,781 Selling, general and administrative 2,975 1,004 60 1,791 120 1,971 Depreciation and amortization 4,026 1,434 72 2,394 126 2,592 Total operating expenses $ 13,326 4,982 128 7,708 508 8,344 Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 CenturyLink Embarq Total (Dollars in millions) Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 2,544 1,801 (59 ) 802 743 Selling, general and administrative 1,004 965 (87 ) 126 39 Depreciation and amortization 1,434 975 (22 ) 481 459 Total operating expenses $ 4,982 3,741 (168 ) 1,409 1,241 The increases in total operating expenses of $8.344 billion in 2011 was largely attributable to the inclusion of $7.7 billion in post acquisition Legacy Qwest operating expenses (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated operating expenses. In addition, the acquisition of Savvis on July 15, 2011 increased our consolidated operating expenses by $508 million. As discussed in the "overview" section, our operating expenses for 2011, 2010 and 2009 included substantial severance and integration costs related to the Qwest, Savvis and Embarq acquisitions as well as significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense (see Note 2 Acquisitions and Note 3 Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets). Excluding the effects of Legacy Qwest and Savvis expenses, total operating expenses in 2011 increased $128 million, or 2.6%, due primarily to integration costs associated with the Qwest acquisition and increased costs of providing our facilities based video services to more customers. Total operating expenses in 2010 (excluding $1.409 billion of incremental costs associated with operating the Embarq properties for a full year in 2010 as compared to a half year in 2009), decreased $168 million primarily due to a $104 million reduction in operating expenses from the elimination of all intercompany transactions upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a $32 million reduction in salaries and benefits. Cost of services and products for Legacy CenturyLink operations was relatively unchanged in 2011. For 2011, higher costs of services and products associated with providing our facilities based video service of $55 million were substantially offset by a $28 million decrease in salaries and benefits and a $20 million decrease in facilities costs associated with the migration of legacy Embarq long distance traffic to our internal networks. Costs of services and products in 2010 (excluding $802 million of incremental costs associated with operating the Embarq properties for a full year in 2010 as compared to a half year in 2009) decreased $59 million primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses from the elimination of all intercompany transactions upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. 51 Table of Contents Legacy CenturyLink selling, general and administrative expenses increased $60 million, or 6.0%, for 2011 as compared to 2010, while selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $87 million for 2010 as compared to 2009. For all periods presented, our expenses include significant transaction, severance and integration expenses related to the Savvis, Qwest and Embarq acquisitions (see table in "Overview" above). Changes in the timing and amount of Qwest and Savvis integration expenses resulted in net increases in Legacy CenturyLink selling, general and administrative expenses of $164 million in 2011, from the amounts for the comparable periods of 2010. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $33 million in 2011 in operating taxes, which were primarily due to favorable property tax and transaction tax settlements. In addition, in 2011 we had a decrease of $20 million in compensation expenses, which were primarily due to workforce reductions and lower pension expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2010 (excluding $126 million of incremental costs associated with operating the Embarq properties for a full year in 2010 as compared to a half year in 2009) decreased $87 million primarily due to a $32 million reduction in salaries and benefits, a $17 million decrease in legal costs and a $15 million reduction in expenses from the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting. Depreciation and amortization for Legacy CenturyLink increased $72 million, or 5.0%, in 2011 primarily due to higher levels of property, plant and equipment. Depreciation and amortization in 2010 (excluding $481 million of incremental expense associated with operating the Embarq properties for a full year in 2010 as compared to a half year in 2009) decreased $22 million due to a $19 million decrease resulting from a change in certain depreciation rates effective July 1, 2009 upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a $25 million decrease of certain assets becoming fully depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by a $22 million increase due to higher levels of plant in service. 52  Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results The following tables summarize our total other income (expense) and income tax expense: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Savvis Total (Dollars in millions) Interest expense $ (1,072 ) (544 ) 34 486 8 528 Other income (expense) (5 ) 15 17 6 (3 ) 20 Total other income (expense) $ (1,077 ) (529 ) 51 492 5 548 Income tax expense $ 375 583 nm nm nm (208 ) Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 CenturyLink Embarq Total (Dollars in millions) Interest expense $ (544 ) (367 ) 13 164 177 Other income (expense) 15 (53 ) (25 ) (43 ) (68 ) Total other income (expense) $ (529 ) (420 ) (12 ) 121 109 Income tax expense $ 583 302 nm nm 281 nm Attributing changes in income tax expense to the acquisitions of Savvis, Qwest and Embarq is considered not meaningful. Other Income (Expense) Interest expense increased $528 million in 2011 primarily due to debt assumed in the Qwest acquisition and incurred subsequent to that acquisition. See Note 4 Long term Debt and Credit Facilities and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below for additional information about the debt assumed in the Qwest acquisition. Interest expense for Legacy CenturyLink increased $34 million, or 6.3%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and $13 million, or 3.5%, in 2010 compared to 2009. In 2011, the increase was primarily due to interest on our senior notes with $2 billion aggregate principal that were issued in June 2011 to finance the Savvis acquisition, partially offset by principal repayments made during 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. In 2010, interest expense increased primarily due to the interest expense attributable to $4.9 billion of Embarqs indebtedness we assumed in mid 2009. Other income (expense) reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including gains and losses from non operating asset dispositions and impairments, our share of income from our 49% interest in a cellular partnership, interest income and foreign currency gains and losses. Other income (expense) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased $17 million in 2011, as compared to 2010. This change was primarily due to $16 million in transaction expenses incurred in connection with terminating an unused bridge loan financing commitment related to the Savvis acquisition (see Note 2 Acquisitions). The change from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the recognition of a $72 million pre tax charge for certain debt extinguishment transactions consummated in October 2009 (of which $27 million was incurred by CenturyLink and $45 million was incurred by Embarq). 53 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 decreased $208 million and increased $281 million, respectively, from the amounts for the comparable year. Our decrease in 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax expense due primarily to the acquisition of Qwest. Our 2010 increase was due to increased income before income tax expense due in part to the inclusion of a full year of Embarq operations in 2010. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our effective income tax rate was 39.6%, 38.1% and 37.2%, respectively. The 2011 increase was due in part to the effects of certain nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition of Qwest, which was substantially offset by the effects of a tax law change in one of the states in which we operate that resulted in recognition of a $14 million tax benefit in the second quarter of 2011. In addition, due to executive compensation limitations pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, a portion of the lump sum distributions related to the termination of an executive retirement plan made in the first quarter of 2009 is reflected as non deductible for income tax purposes and thus increased our effective income tax rate. Certain merger related costs incurred during 2010 and 2009 are also non deductible for income tax purposes and similarly increased our effective income tax rate. In 2009, such an increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by a $7 million reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, in 2009 we recognized net after tax benefits of approximately $16 million primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 12 Income Taxes and "Income Tax Expense" for additional information. Extraordinary Item Upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting on July 1, 2009, we recorded a one time extraordinary gain of approximately $136 million after tax. See Note 14 Discontinuance of Regulatory Accounting for additional information related to this extraordinary gain. 54 Table of Contents Segment Results Segment information is summarized below: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Total segment revenues $ 14,471 6,495 Total segment expenses 6,535 2,403 Total segment income $ 7,936 4,092 Total margin percentage 55% 63% Regional markets: Revenues $ 7,832 4,640 Expenses 3,398 1,783 Income $ 4,434 2,857 Margin percentage 57% 62% Business markets: Revenues $ 2,861 266 Expenses 1,736 120 Income $ 1,125 146 Margin percentage 39% 55% Wholesale markets: Revenues $ 3,295 1,589 Expenses 1,021 500 Income $ 2,274 1,089 Margin percentage 69% 69% Savvis operations: Revenues $ 483 Expenses 380 Income $ 103 Margin percentage 21% The lower levels of margin percentage for regional markets and business markets in 2011 were primarily attributable to the inclusion of Qwests results beginning April 1, 2011. For several years prior to 2011, we reported our operations as a single segment. Due to system limitations we have not reported our 2009 segment information using our current segments as we have deemed it impracticable to do so. As such, the following section only includes data for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. See consolidated operating results in the "Results of Operations Overview" section above for variance discussions related to our 2009 financial information. 55 Table of Contents The following table reconciles our total segment revenues and total segment income presented above to operating revenues and operating income reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Total segment revenues $ 14,471 6,495 Other operating revenues 880 547 Operating revenues reported in our consolidated statements of operations $ 15,351 7,042 Total segment income $ 7,936 4,092 Other operating revenues 880 547 Depreciation and amortization (4,026 ) (1,434 ) Other unassigned operating expenses (2,765 ) (1,145 ) Operating income reported in our consolidated statements of operations $ 2,025 2,060 In connection with the recent reorganization of our segments, we also revised the way we categorize our segment revenues and segment expenses. Our major categories of products and services are strategic services, legacy services, data integration and other, each of which is described in more detail in "Operating Revenues" above. We report our segment expenses for regional markets, business markets and wholesale markets as follows: Direct expenses, which primarily are specific, incremental expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers, along with selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities; and Allocated expenses, which are determined by applying activity based costing and other methodologies to include network expenses, facilities expenses and other expenses such as fleet, product management and real estate expenses. For Savvis operations, segment expenses incorporate the entire operations of our Savvis subsidiaries, including certain centrally managed costs that are allocated to our other segments and overhead costs that are not allocated to our other operating segments. The integration of certain of these functions for Savvis are still in the early stages. Consequently, all Savvis operations segment expenses have been categorized as direct expenses. We intend to refine our expense methodology and begin allocating expenses to Savvis operations as we continue integrating it among our other segments beginning in 2012. We do not assign depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, as the related assets and capital expenditures are centrally managed. Other unassigned operating expenses consist primarily of expenses for centrally managed administrative functions (such as finance, information technology, legal and human resources), severance expenses and restructuring expenses. Interest expense is also excluded from segment results because we manage our financing on a total company basis and have not allocated assets or debt to specific segments. In addition, other income (expense) does not relate to our segment operations and is therefore excluded from our segment results. We have recast our 2010 operating results based on our new segment reporting. 56 Table of Contents We may make further changes to our segment reporting as we continue to integrate the operations of Legacy Qwest and Legacy Savvis. For more information on our segment reporting, see Note 13 Segment Information. Regional Markets The operations of our regional markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below. The discussion that follows generally applies to both our Legacy CenturyLink markets and our Legacy Qwest markets for periods after the April 1, 2011 acquisition date. Strategic services. We continue to focus on increasing subscribers of our broadband services in our regional markets segment. In order to remain competitive, we believe continually increasing connection speeds is important. As a result, we continue to invest in our fiber to the node, or FTTN, deployment, which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services. While traditional ATM based broadband services are declining, they have been more than offset by growth in fiber based broadband services. We also continue to expand our product offerings including facilities based video services and enhance our marketing efforts as we compete in a maturing market in which most consumers already have broadband services. We expect these efforts will improve our ability to compete and increase our broadband revenues. Facilities based video expenses. As we continue to expand our facilities based video services we are incurring start up expenses in advance of the revenue that this service is expected to generate. Although, over time, we expect that our revenue for facilities based video services will offset the expenses incurred, the timing of this revenue growth is uncertain. Access lines. Our voice revenues have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice and electronic mail and social networking services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect that these factors will continue to impact our business. Service bundling and other product promotions, as described below, continue to be some of our responses to offset the loss of revenues as a result of access line losses. Service bundling and product promotions. We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services. These customers can bundle local services with other services such as broadband, video, long distance and wireless. While our video and wireless services are an important piece of our customer retention strategy, they do not make a large contribution to strategic services revenues. However, we believe customers value the convenience of, and price discounts associated with, receiving multiple services through a single company. While bundle price discounts have resulted in lower average revenues for our individual products, we believe service bundles continue to positively impact our customer retention. In addition to our bundle discounts, we also offer limited time promotions on our broadband service for prospective customers who want our broadband product in their bundle which further aids our ability to attract and retain customers and increase usage of our services. Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions. 57 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the operating results from Legacy CenturyLink and Legacy Qwest for our regional markets segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 2,532 1,212 55 1,265 1,320 Legacy services 5,171 3,289 (280 ) 2,162 1,882 Data integration 129 139 (14 ) 4 (10 ) Total revenues 7,832 4,640 (239 ) 3,431 3,192 Segment expenses: Direct 3,252 1,818 3 1,431 1,434 Allocated 146 (35 ) (26 ) 207 181 Total expenses 3,398 1,783 (23 ) 1,638 1,615 Segment income $ 4,434 2,857 (216 ) 1,793 1,577 Segment margin percentage 57% 62% Segment Income The acquisition of Qwest on April 1, 2011 largely contributed to an increase in our regional markets segment income of $1.577 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. Our consolidated segment margin percentage declined in 2011 as a result of lower margins in Legacy Qwest markets. Segment income for our Legacy CenturyLink operations decreased $216 million as compared to 2010 reflecting declines in revenues while expenses remained relatively flat. Segment Revenues Excluding 2011 revenues attributable to the Qwest acquisition, regional markets revenues decreased $239 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. Growth in strategic services revenues did not fully offset a decline in legacy services revenues. The higher amounts of strategic services revenues are due principally to volume increases in our facilities based video services and increases in the number of broadband subscribers, partially offset by the effects of rate discounts. Increases in MPLS and Ethernet services volumes also contributed to higher strategic services revenues. Legacy services revenues decreased primarily due to declines in local services associated with access line losses resulting from competitive pressures. Segment Expenses Regional markets expenses, exclusive of Legacy Qwest expenses, decreased $23 million, or 1.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses and decreased employee related expense due to workforce reductions, partially offset by increased costs to provide facilities based video services. Business Markets The operations of our business markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below. The discussion that follows generally applies to both our Legacy CenturyLink markets and our Legacy Qwest markets for periods after the April 1, 2011 acquisition date. 58 Table of Contents Strategic services. Our mix of total revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our enterprise and government customers increasingly demand customized and integrated data, Internet and voice services. We offer diverse combinations of emerging technology products and services such as private line, MPLS, hosting, and VoIP services. We believe these services afford our customers more flexibility in managing their communications needs and enable us to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their operations. Although we are experiencing price compression on our strategic services, we expect overall revenues from these services to grow. Legacy services. We face intense competition with respect to our legacy services and continue to see customers migrating away from these services and into strategic services. In addition, our legacy services revenues have been and we expect they will continue to be adversely affected by access line losses. Data integration. We expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this revenue stream tends to be more sensitive than other revenue streams to changes in the economy and to changes in spending trends of our federal government customers. Operating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our productivity improvements while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation. We also expect our business markets segment to benefit indirectly from efficiencies in our company wide network operations. The following table summarizes the operating results from Legacy CenturyLink and Legacy Qwest for our business markets segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 1,341 57 1 1,283 1,284 Legacy services 1,113 190 (9 ) 932 923 Data integration 407 19 (9 ) 397 388 Total revenues 2,861 266 (17 ) 2,612 2,595 Segment expenses: Direct 764 6 8 750 758 Allocated 972 114 (11 ) 869 858 Total expenses 1,736 120 (3 ) 1,619 1,616 Segment income $ 1,125 146 (14 ) 993 979 Segment margin percentage 39% 55% Segment Income The acquisition of Qwest on April 1, 2011 substantially increased the scale of our business markets segment, resulting in an increase in our segment income of $979 million, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. Our consolidated segment margin percentage declined in 2011 as a result of lower margins in Legacy Qwest markets. Legacy Qwest operations accounted for 91.3% of our 2011 business markets segment revenues and 88.3% of our segment income. 59 Table of Contents Segment Revenues Legacy CenturyLink business markets revenues decreased $17 million, or 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. This decrease primarily reflected lower revenues from legacy services driven by access line losses and lower data integration revenues due to lower sales of data integration equipment. Segment Expenses Legacy CenturyLink business markets expenses remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. However, direct expenses increased primarily due to increased employee related expenses resulting from a larger sales force and higher customer premise equipment expenses in 2011, while allocated expenses decreased due to lower network expenses related to cost optimization efforts. Wholesale Markets The operations of our wholesale markets segment will likely be impacted by the recently adopted FCC order which will substantially increase the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues we receive, as discussed in the "Regulation" section in Item 1 of this report, as well as the significant trends discussed below. The discussion that follows generally applies to both our Legacy CenturyLink markets and our Legacy Qwest markets for periods after the April 1, 2011 acquisition date. Private line services (including special access). Demand for our private line services continues to increase, despite our customers optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration. While we expect that these factors will continue to impact our wholesale markets segment, we ultimately believe the growth in fiber based special access provided to wireless carriers for backhaul will, over time, offset the decline in copper based special access provided to wireless carriers as they migrate to Ethernet, and bandwidth consumption grows, although the timing and magnitude of this technological migration is uncertain. Access and local services revenues. Our access and local services revenues have been and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by regulation, technological migration, industry consolidation and rate reductions. For example, consumers are substituting cable, wireless and VoIP services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access revenue loss. We expect these factors will continue to adversely impact our wholesale markets segment. Long distance services revenues. Wholesale long distance revenues continue to decline as a result of customer migration to more technologically advanced services, price compression, declining demand for traditional voice services and industry consolidation. 60 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the operating results from Legacy CenturyLink and Legacy Qwest for our wholesale markets segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 CenturyLink Qwest Total (Dollars in millions) Segment revenues: Strategic services $ 1,898 780 94 1,024 1,118 Legacy services 1,396 809 (194 ) 781 587 Data integration 1 1 1 Total revenues 3,295 1,589 (100 ) 1,806 1,706 Segment expenses: Direct 174 139 (6 ) 41 35 Allocated 847 361 61 425 486 Total expenses 1,021 500 55 466 521 Segment income $ 2,274 1,089 (155 ) 1,340 1,185 Segment margin percentage 69% 69% Segment Income The acquisition of Qwest on April 1, 2011 largely contributed to an increase in our wholesale markets segment income of $1.185 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. Segment income for our Legacy CenturyLink operations decreased $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily reflecting declines in revenues in both periods, as discussed further below. Segment Revenues Excluding 2011 revenues attributable to the Qwest acquisition, wholesale markets revenues decreased $100 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. This decrease reflects substantially lower revenues from legacy services, partially offset by growth in revenues from strategic services. The decrease in legacy services revenues reflects ongoing declines in access and local services volumes and revenues due to the substitution of cable, wireless and VoIP services for traditional voice telecommunications services. Growth in strategic services revenues, primarily relating to private line and special access services, partially offset the declines in legacy services revenues. Segment Expenses Wholesale markets expenses, exclusive of Legacy Qwest expenses, increased $55 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase in Legacy CenturyLink wholesale markets expenses was primarily due to increased allocated expenses reflecting increased bad debts expense. Direct expenses decreased for the year as a result of reduced access costs. Savvis Operations The operations of our Savvis operations segment could be impacted by several significant trends, including those described below. Colocation. Colocation is designed for clients seeking data center space and power for their server and networking equipment needs. Our data centers provide our clients around the world with a secure, high powered, purpose built location for their IT equipment. We anticipate 61 Table of Contents continued pricing pressure for these services as wholesale vendors enter the enterprise colocation market; however, we believe that our data center expansion strategy can help mitigate these pricing challenges. Managed hosting. Managed hosting services provide a fully managed solution for a customers IT infrastructure and network needs, and include dedicated and cloud hosting services, utility and computing storage, consulting and managed security services. We expect increasing pricing pressure on the managed hosting business from competing cloud computing offerings. However, we remain focused on growing our managed hosting business, specifically in our cloud service offerings, as we believe this is a key to growth. We believe that we have continued to strengthen our cloud position in the market by adding differentiating features to our cloud products. Network services. Network services are comprised of our managed network services, including managed VPN, hosting area network and bandwidth services. Segment income for these services has been relatively flat due to pricing pressures on VPN and bandwidth services, offset by increases in network services that support our colocation and managed hosting service offerings. The following tables summarize the operating results of Savvis operations for 2011 after their acquisition date of July 15, 2011: Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Strategic services $ 483 483 Segment expenses 380 380 Segment income $ 103 103 Segment margin percentage 21% Segment Revenues Segment revenues for our Savvis operations was $483 million, which was derived from colocation services of $183 million, or 37.9%, managed hosting services of $182 million, or 37.7%, and network services of $118 million, or 24.4%. Segment Expenses Segment expenses attributed to Savvis operations was $380 million, which were derived primarily from cost of services and products of $260 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $120 million. 62  Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) business combinations; (ii) goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (iii) property, plant and equipment; (iv) pension and post retirement benefits; (v) loss contingencies and litigation reserves; and (vi) income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Business Combinations We have accounted for our acquisition of Qwest on April 1, 2011 and Savvis on July 15, 2011 under the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill. The recognition of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations involves estimates and judgments by our management that may be adjusted during the measurement period, but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date. The fair values recorded are made based on managements best estimates and assumptions. In arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we consider the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, income approach and market approach. Our estimates may also include assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology life cycles, the regulatory and legal environment, and industry and economic trends. Small changes in the underlying assumptions can impact the estimates of fair value by material amounts, which can in turn materially impact our results of operations. Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets We amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 10 years, using either the sum of the years digits or straight line methods, depending on the type of customer. Our capitalized software, which consists primarily of assets obtained from the Qwest acquisition, is primarily being amortized using the straight line method over estimated lives up to seven years. Approximately $237 million of our capitalized software, which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system, is being amortized over a twenty year period. Tradenames and patents assets predominantly use the sum of the years digits method over an estimated life of four years. Indefinite life intangibles are not amortized, but are reviewed annually for potential impairment. We periodically review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets. The amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our periodic reviews and our final determinations of acquisition date fair value related to Savvis and Qwests intangible assets (See Note 2 Acquisitions). We are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets (including goodwill, intangible assets and other long lived assets) based on applicable accounting guidelines. 63 Table of Contents We are required to review goodwill recorded in business combinations for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write down the value of goodwill only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value. Our annual measurement date for testing goodwill impairment is September 30. We have managed our operations based on four operating segments (regional markets, business markets, wholesale markets and Savvis operations) and considered these four operating segments to be the appropriate level for testing goodwill impairment. We have attributed our goodwill balance to our segments at December 31, 2011 as follows: (Dollars in millions) Regional markets $ 11,813 Business markets 5,021 Wholesale markets 3,533 Savvis operations 1,357 Total goodwill $ 21,724 With the exception of our Savvis segment, our operating segments do not correspond to our legal entity organization structure, which required us to apply significant judgment based on numerous assumptions to attribute our goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities to the operating segments in order to make our annual impairment assessment. For this assessment, we compare each segments estimated fair value to the carrying value of the assets that we attribute to the segment. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value, we conclude that no impairment exists. If the fair value of the segment is less than the carrying value, a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill that we attribute to the segment. Estimating the implied fair value of goodwill requires further assumptions and the application of judgment to assess the current fair values of the assets and liabilities attributable to the segment. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value, goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value. Small changes in the assumptions underlying either the valuation methods or the attribution methods can drive material changes in the implied fair value of goodwill. At September 30, 2011, we estimated the fair value of our regional, business and wholesale markets reporting units using an equal weighting based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours to corroborate discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete five year projection period. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents our weighted average cost of capital, which we determined to be 6.50% as of the measurement date (which was comprised of a pre tax cost of debt of 7.0% and a cost of equity of 8.7%). We also reconciled the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of September 30, 2011 and concluded that the indicated implied control premium of 16% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place. For our Savvis operations, we determined the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using various methods, including an overall discounted cash flow analysis performed for all of Savvis operations. As of September 30, 2011, the fair value assignments were preliminary and could change significantly upon finalization of the fair value assignments. Due to the recentness of the acquisition and the related preliminary valuation results and the lack of any significant adverse events that have occurred to Savvis operating results or our expectations of forecasted operating results 64 Table of Contents utilized in the preliminary valuation since the July 15, 2011 acquisition date, we concluded that the goodwill related to the Savvis operations was not impaired as of September 30, 2011. As of September 30, 2011, based on our analysis performed with respect to these segments as described above, we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of that date. However, as of that date, the estimated fair value of the regional markets and wholesale markets exceeded their carrying value by less than 5%. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate used in our analysis would have caused the estimated fair values of the regional markets and wholesale markets goodwill to be less than their carrying values and thus would have required us to perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing. On October 27, 2011, the FCC adopted the Connect America and Intercarrier Compensation Reform order (the "CAF order"). This order will reduce the amount of switched access revenue we recognize in our wholesale markets segment in the future. Although other elements of this order are currently expected to result in positive impacts to our overall business, it will likely have a material negative impact to our wholesale markets segment. Because we expect the order to have a material negative impact on our wholesale markets segment, we conducted another assessment of the goodwill attributed to the wholesale markets segment at December 31, 2011. In the process of re estimating the fair value of the wholesale markets segment as a result of the CAF order, we updated our estimates of projected future cash flows and we revised our market multiple assumption. In our most recent estimate, we revised our revenue projections to stabilize by 2016 rather than our previous assumption that revenues would decline in perpetuity, and thus increasing our terminal value. After updating our fair value estimate of the wholesale markets segment to reflect revised estimates of revenues, the effects of our market multiple assumption due to changes in our stock price between September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011, the increase in terminal value and the adverse effects of the CAF order, the estimated fair value of the wholesale markets segment exceeded its attributed carrying value by greater than 5%. We also evaluated and concluded that the goodwill attributed to our other reporting units was not impaired as of December 31, 2011 due to (i) an increase in our market capitalization since September 30, 2011, (ii) a reduction in our carrying value of equity since September 30, 2011 and (iii) the lack of significant adverse changes in the operating forecasts of our other segments. We cannot assure that other adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment testing or an impairment charge. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment testing. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) further weakening in the overall economy; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization; (iii) changes in the discount rate; (iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of regulatory actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the overall business climate; (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of our reporting units and (viii) additional information relative to the impact of the CAF order. We will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required testing date of September 30, 2012. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its fair value as of its acquisition date. Substantially all other property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost less depreciation. Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight line method using class or overall group rates; such average annual rates range from 2% to 29%. 65 Table of Contents Normal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss recognized. Other types of property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and, when sold or retired, a gain or loss is recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight line method over estimated service lives ranging from two to 35 years. We perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution to estimate the remaining life of our asset base. The changes in our estimates incorporated as a result of our most recent review did not have a material impact on the level of our depreciation expense. Pension and Post Retirement Benefits We sponsor several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (referred to as our pension plans) for substantially all employees. In addition to these tax qualified pension plans, we also maintain several non qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We maintain post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. Pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits attributed to eligible employees service during the year, as well as interest on benefit obligations, are accrued currently. Pension and post retirement benefit expenses are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method. Pension prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits. Post retirement healthcare prior service costs are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average expected years to full benefit eligibility for active employees. Post retirement actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the average expected future working lifetime of active employees. In computing the pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits expenses and obligations, the most significant assumptions we make include discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, health care trend rates and our evaluation of the legal basis for plan amendments. The plan benefits covered by collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with our employees unions can also significantly impact the amount of expense, benefit obligations and pension assets that we record. The discount rate is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the benefit obligations as of the end of the year. We selected the discount based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves developed by an actuary firm from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments, as is generated by discounting each years benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds. The expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long term expectations of various third party investment management organizations. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy. To compute the expected return on pension and post retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the 66 Table of Contents post retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. Annual market volatility for these assets is reflected in the subsequent years net periodic combined benefits expense. Changes in any of the above factors could impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive income of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post retirement benefit expense. If our assumed expected rates of return for 2011 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post retirement benefit expenses would have increased by $98 million. If our assumed discount rates for 2011 were 100 basis points lower, our qualified pension and post retirement benefit expenses would have decreased by $29 million and our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $1.8 billion. An increase of 100 basis points in the initial healthcare cost trend rate would have increased our post retirement benefit expense by $2 million and increased our projected post retirement benefit obligation by $70 million. The trusts for the pension and post retirement benefits plans hold investments in equities, fixed income, real estate and other assets such as private equity assets. The assets held by these trusts are reflected at estimated fair value as of December 31, 2011. For additional information on our trust investments, see Note 8 Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. Loss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves We are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of this report. We assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted. If a loss is considered reasonably possible, we disclose any determinable estimate of the loss if material but we do not recognize any expense for the potential loss. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax NOLs, tax credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred taxes often involves an exercise of judgment related to the realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken and the resulting tax basis, are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities. Also, assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate. These and other matters involve the exercise of significant judgment. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. 67 Table of Contents We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities as described above. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be recovered. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of pre tax earnings, estimated timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets and our forecasts of future earnings, the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At December 31, 2011, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize the majority of our deferred tax assets. If forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 12 Income Taxes for additional information. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This update simplifies the goodwill impairment assessment by allowing a company to first review qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the company would not be required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test for that reporting unit. This update is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. This ASU, which we adopted during the third quarter of 2011, did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. This update requires the use of the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in these types of arrangements. This method requires a vendor to use its best estimate of selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists when evaluating multiple deliverable arrangements. This standard update was effective for us on January 1, 2011 and we have adopted it prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after January 1, 2011. This standard update has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements since the allocation of revenue has historically been based upon the relative fair value of the elements as determined by reference to vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when the elements have been sold on a stand alone basis. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview At December 31, 2011, we held cash and cash equivalents of $128 million and had $1.423 billion available under our $1.7 billion revolving credit facility (referred to as our "Credit Facility", which is described further below). Excluding cash used for acquisitions, we have generally relied on cash provided by operations and our Credit Facility to fund our operating and capital expenditures, make our dividend payments and repay a portion of our maturing debt. Our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow that has helped us meet the needs of the business. Our acquisition of Qwest on April 1, 2011 and, to a lesser extent, Savvis on July 15, 2011, resulted in significant changes in our consolidated financial position and our future cash requirements. At December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $128 million, compared to $173 million at December 31, 2010. 68 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, we had a working capital deficit of $496 million, reflecting current liabilities of $4.019 billion and current assets of $3.523 billion, compared to positive working capital of $132 million at December 31, 2010. The unfavorable change in our working capital position is primarily due to our consolidation of Qwests working capital accounts as well as $480 million in current maturities of long term debt at December 31, 2011. We anticipate that our existing cash balances and net cash provided by operating activities, which were significantly enhanced by our acquisition of Qwest, will enable us to meet our other current obligations, fund capital expenditures and pay dividends to our shareholders. We also may draw on our Credit Facility as a source of liquidity if and when necessary. We currently expect to continue our current annual dividend of $2.90 per common share, subject to our boards discretion. Debt and Other Financing Arrangements We have available a four year $1.7 billion revolving Credit Facility, which expires in January 2015. Up to $400 million of the Credit Facility can be used for letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit. Available borrowings under the Credit Facility are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. Our commercial paper program borrowings are effectively limited to the lesser of $1.5 billion or the total amount available under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2011, we had $277 million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility, and no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. The Credit Facility has 21 lenders, with commitments ranging from $2.5 million to $135 million. Under the Credit Facility, we, and our indirect subsidiary, Qwest Corporation, ("QC"), must maintain a debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined in our Credit Facility) ratio of not more than 4:1 and 2.85:1, respectively, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended. The Credit Facility also contains a negative pledge covenant, which generally provides restrictions if we pledge assets or permit liens on our property, and requires that any advances under the Credit Facility must also be secured equally and ratably. The Credit Facility also has a cross payment default provision, and the Credit Facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. To the extent that our EBITDA (as defined in our Credit Facility), is reduced by cash settlements or judgments, including in respect of any of the matters discussed in Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies, our debt to EBITDA ratios under certain debt agreements will be adversely affected. This could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or, in certain circumstances, could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements. At December 31, 2011, our long term debt (including current maturities) totaled $21.836 billion, compared to $7.328 billion outstanding at December 31, 2010. Substantially all of the $14.508 billion increase in our debt is attributable to the acquisition of Qwest on April 1, 2011 and our recent debt issuances to fund the acquisition of Savvis and the retirement of its credit facility in July 2011. Approximately $318 million of our CenturyLink, Inc. Series L 7.875% notes will mature on August 15, 2012 and on January 27, 2012, we called $800 million of Qwest Communications International Inc. 7.500% notes due February 15, 2014, committing to retire them on March 1, 2012. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt. This includes issuing debt securities of CenturyLink or through our QC subsidiary to refinance its maturing debt. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and QC by the three 69 Table of Contents major credit rating agencies, among other factors. Following our announcement in April 2011 of our agreement to purchase Savvis, one of these agencies revised its previous outlook on its rating of us from stable to negative. We believe this negative outlook could result in a ratings downgrade if we are unable to reduce our "debt leverage ratio," while maintaining "free cash flow" (each as defined by the ratings agency) over the 12 to 18 months following the negative outlook announcement. Between the date of this report and the end of 2012, we currently expect to reduce our consolidated debt levels by $800 million to $1.300 billion, based on current circumstances and market conditions. In April 2011, we entered into a $160 million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility. At December 31, 2011, our outstanding letters of credit totaled $129 million under this facility. Future Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 and thereafter Total (Dollars in millions) Long term debt, including current maturities and capital lease obligations $ 480 1,717 2,057 1,659 2,856 12,798 21,567 Interest on long term debt and capital leases(1) 1,478 1,409 1,313 1,185 1,003 11,715 18,103 Operating leases 280 244 208 178 147 928 1,985 Purchase commitments(2) 268 114 77 52 47 148 706 Post retirement benefit obligation 71 71 70 69 120 1,195 1,596 Non qualified pension obligations 3 2 2 2 2 22 33 Unrecognized tax benefits(3) 86 86 Other 4 12 7 5 5 112 145 Total future contractual obligations(4) $ 2,584 3,569 3,734 3,150 4,180 27,004 44,221 (1)Interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of debt. Interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective at December 31, 2011. (2)We have various long term, non cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services, including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events. We also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing, technical and software support services. Future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage. In the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to receive. (3)Represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits. Of our total balance of unrecognized tax benefits of $111 million and related estimated interest and penalties of $33 million, only $86 million would result in future cash payments if our tax positions were not upheld. The remaining $58 million is an unrecognized tax benefit in the form of a refund claim that, if not granted, would not result in a cash payment and therefore is not included in the table above. See Note 12 Income Taxes for additional information. The timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty; therefore, such amount is reflected in the "2017 and thereafter" column in the above table. (4)The table does not include: our open purchase orders as of December 31, 2011. These purchase orders are generally at fair value, and are generally cancelable without penalty; other long term liabilities, such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual obligations by nature. We cannot determine with any degree of reliability the years in which these liabilities might ultimately settle; 70 Table of Contents cash funding requirements for pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Benefits paid by our qualified pension plans are paid through trusts. Cash funding requirements for the trusts are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required contributions to the trust. Our funding projections are discussed further below; certain post retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees. Not all of our post retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table. See additional information on our benefits plans in Note 8 Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report; contract termination fees. These fees are non recurring payments, the timing and payment of which, if any, is uncertain. In the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure, we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services. Our contracts to use other carriers network facilities generally have no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates. Assuming we exited these contracts in 2012, the contract termination fees would be approximately $819 million. Under the same assumption, termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services would be $185 million. In the normal course of business, we believe the payment of these fees is likely to be remote; and potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal course of business. The nature and terms of these arrangements vary. Historically, we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of arrangements. Capital Expenditures We incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted revenue growth or productivity, expense and service impacts) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products, cash generated by operating activities and regulatory considerations. We estimate our total 2012 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion. Our capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services such as video, broadband and managed hosting services. In 2012, we anticipate that our fiber investment, which includes fiber to the tower, or FTTT, will be similar to that spent in 2011. FTTT is a type of telecommunications network consisting of fiber optic cables that run from a telecommunication providers broadband interconnection points to cellular towers. FTTT allows for the delivery of higher bandwidth services supporting mobile technologies than would otherwise generally be available through a more traditional telecommunications network. Pension and Post retirement Benefit Obligations We are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans. The accounting unfunded status as of December 31, 2011 of our defined pension plans and other post retirement benefit obligations was $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. See Note 8 Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information about our pension and other post retirement benefit arrangements. Benefits paid by our pension plans are paid through a trust. We contributed $587 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 to our pension plans and expect to make a contribution of less than $50 million in 2012. We currently expect that required and voluntary contributions for 2013 will be approximately $500 million, based on current laws and circumstances. The actual amount of contributions to our plans in 2013 and beyond will depend on earnings on investments, discount rates, demographic experience, changes in plans benefits and funding laws and regulations. 71  Table of Contents Certain of our post retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several trusts hold assets that are used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of these trust assets was $693 million; however, a portion of these assets is comprised of investments with restricted liquidity. We estimate that the more liquid assets in the trust will be adequate to provide continuing reimbursements for covered post retirement health care costs for approximately four years. Thereafter, covered benefits will be paid either directly by us or from the trusts as the remaining assets become liquid. This projected four year period could be substantially shorter or longer depending on returns on plan assets, the timing of maturities of illiquid plan assets and future changes in benefits. Historical Information The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flow activities (which include cash flows from Savvis, Qwest and Embarq after their respective acquisition dates): Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,201 2,045 2,156 Net cash used in investing activities (3,647 ) (859 ) 2,788 Net cash used in financing activities (577 ) (1,175 ) (598 ) Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,045 1,574 471 Net cash used in investing activities (859 ) (679 ) 180 Net cash used in financing activities (1,175 ) (976 ) 199 The increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 is largely attributable to the acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis, which contributed net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $2.1 billion and $90 million, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 increased primarily due to 2010 including a full year of operations of Embarq as compared to only a half year in 2009. Our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 in this report provide information about the components of net income and differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities. For additional information about our operating results, see "Results of Operations" above. Net cash used in investing activities included payments for property, plant and equipment and capitalized software of $2.411 billion in 2011, including $1.329 billion for Qwest and Savvis post acquisition capital expenditures, compared to $864 million in 2010. In addition, we paid $1.671 billion, net of $61 million cash received, for the acquisition of Savvis on July 15, 2011. Cash used in investing activities in 2011 was partially offset by cash acquired through the April 1, 2011 acquisition of Qwest of $419 million, net of $5 million cash paid. Net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2011 primarily due to us receiving net debt proceeds in excess of payments of approximately $1.1 billion in 2011 and a debt payment of $500 million in 2010. In addition, our cash dividends paid increased $677 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the issuance of 308 million common shares in connection with our acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis in 2011. Net cash used in financing activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 increased due to a $319 million increase in cash dividends paid, primarily due to the issuance of 72 Table of Contents 196 million shares issued on July 1, 2011 for the acquisition of Embarq, partially offset with $73 million in increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans. On October 4, 2011, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Qwest Corporation ("QC"), issued $950 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% Notes due 2021 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $927 million. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of QC and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of their principal amount or the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments discounted at a U.S. Treasury interest rate specified in the indenture agreement plus 50 basis points. On September 21, 2011, QC issued $575 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.50% Notes due 2051 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $557 million. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of QC and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after September 15, 2016 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. In October 2011, QC used the net proceeds from this offering, together with the $927 million of net proceeds received on October 4, 2011, from the debt issuance described above and available cash, to redeem the $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of its 8.875% Notes due 2012 and to pay all related fees and expenses, which resulted in an immaterial loss. On June 16, 2011, we issued unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion ("Senior Notes"), consisting of (i) $400 million of 7.60% Senior Notes, Series P, due 2039, (ii) $350 million of 5.15% Senior Notes, Series R, due 2017 and (iii) $1.250 billion of 6.45% Senior Notes, Series S, due 2021. After deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, we received aggregate net proceeds of $1.959 billion in exchange for the Senior Notes. We may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of their principal amount or the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments discounted at a U.S. Treasury interest rates plus 50 basis points. We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of our acquisition of Savvis and repay certain of Savvis debt (see Note 2 Acquisitions). In April 2011, we received commitment letters from two banks to provide up to $2.0 billion in bridge financing for the Savvis acquisition. This arrangement was terminated in June 2011 in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, resulting in $16 million in transaction expenses recognized in other income (expense), net. On June 8, 2011, QC issued approximately $661 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.375% Notes due 2051 in exchange for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $642 million. The notes are unsecured obligations of QC and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on or after June 1, 2016 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. QC used the net proceeds, together with available cash, to redeem $825 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Notes due 2011 and to pay related fees and expenses. Certain Matters Related to Acquisitions Qwests pre existing debt obligations consisted primarily of debt securities issued by Qwest and two of its subsidiaries while Savvis remaining debt obligations consist primarily of capital leases, all of which are now included in our consolidated debt balances. The indentures governing Qwests debt securities contain customary covenants that restrict the ability of Qwest or its subsidiaries from making certain payments and investments, granting liens and selling or transferring assets. Based on current circumstances, we do not anticipate that these covenants will significantly restrict our ability to manage cash balances or transfer cash between entities within our consolidated group of companies as needed. In accounting for the Qwest acquisition, we recorded Qwests debt securities at their estimated fair values, which totaled $12.292 billion as of April 1, 2011. Our acquisition date fair value estimates were 73 Table of Contents based primarily on quoted market prices in active markets and other observable inputs where quoted market prices were not available. The fair value of Qwests debt securities exceeded their stated principal balances on the acquisition date by $693 million, which is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt, of which $150 million was recognized in 2011. Other Matters We have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries, in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries cash is regularly transferred to us in exchange for matching receivables. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, these receivables are eliminated as intercompany transactions. Although we periodically repay these receivables to fund the subsidiaries cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these receivables, which is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. We also are involved in various legal proceedings that could have a material effect on our financial position. See Note 16 Commitment and Contingencies for the current status of such legal proceedings, including matters involving Qwest. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long term debt obligations. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates. From time to time over the past several years, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates; however, at December 31, 2011 we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure. At December 31, 2011, we have approximately $21.1 billion (excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of $712 million) of long term debt outstanding, 95% of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk. We had $1.049 billion floating rate debt exposed to changes in the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). A hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. With our acquisition of Savvis in July 2011, we have become exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which its international operations are denominated, primarily the euro, the British Pound, the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Singapore Dollar. As a consolidated entity, the percentage of revenues generated and costs incurred that are denominated in these currencies is immaterial. We use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to this foreign currency risk, measuring the change in financial position arising from hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rates of these currencies, relative to the U.S. Dollar with all other variables held constant. The aggregate potential change in the fair value of assets resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in these exchange rates was $15 million at December 31, 2011. Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those presented above if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at December 31, 2011. 74 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging, or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements or in the Future Contractual Obligations table above or (ii) discussed under the heading "Market Risk" above.
