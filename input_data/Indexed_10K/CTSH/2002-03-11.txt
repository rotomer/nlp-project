MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company delivers high quality, cost effective, full life cycle solutions to complex software development and maintenance problems that companies face as they transition to e business. These IT services are delivered through the use of a seamless on site and offshore consulting project team. The Companys service offerings include: o application development and integration; o application management; and o re engineering. During 1996, the Company made a strategic decision to attract customers that were not affiliated with Cognizant Corporation or any of the former affiliates of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. As a result of the implementation of this strategy, the Company has successfully transitioned from a company primarily serving affiliated customers to a company whose customer base now consists primarily of unaffiliated third parties. For example, revenues derived from customers not currently or previously affiliated with The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, Cognizant Corporation, IMS Health, and any of their respective subsidiaries grew from $50.5 million, or 56.8% of revenues, in 1999 to $92.3 million, or 67.4% of revenues, in 2000 and to $129 million, or 72.3% of revenues in 2001. Approximately 43.2%, 32.6% and 27.7% of the Companys revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, were generated from current and former affiliates including approximately 16.7%, 10.4% and 10.6%, respectively, from IMS Health and its current subsidiaries. The Company has derived and believes that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of large third party customers. During 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Companys five largest customers (other than IMS Health and its current subsidiaries) accounted for 44.9%, 34.5% and 28.5% of revenues, respectively. In 1999, IMS Health and First Data Corporation accounted for more than 10.0% of revenue. In 2000 and 2001, IMS Health accounted for more than 10.0% of revenues. The volume of work performed for IMS Health and its subsidiaries and other customers is likely to vary from year to year. Major customers, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, in one year may not provide the same level of revenues in any subsequent year. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 have significantly impacted our travel industry customers, which represent approximately 5% of revenues. In addition, we expect short term logistical delays in launching new initiatives for existing and new customers. There is no evidence that these events have changed our customers strategy of doing business in India. Prior to fiscal 2000, Year 2000 compliance services were an important element of the Companys service offerings. Approximately 15.6% and 0.4% of the Companys revenues were derived from Year 2000 compliance services in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The Company 22 believes that it has successfully utilized its Year 2000 compliance expertise to establish new client relationships and to deepen its relationships with existing customers. The knowledge of customers systems gained while performing Year 2000 compliance services gave the Company a competitive advantage in securing additional application development and application management projects for such customers. Application development and integration services represented approximately 32.3%, 46.1% and 42.9% of revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Application management services accounted for 44.0%, 47.0% and 51.8% of revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Companys services are performed on either a time and materials or fixed price basis. Revenues related to time and materials contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under such method, the sales value of performance, including earnings thereon, is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses, to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of work completed is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in the estimate becomes known. Additionally, any anticipated losses are recognized immediately. Since the Company bears the risk of cost over runs and inflation associated with fixed price projects, the Companys operating results may be adversely affected by changes in estimates of contract completion costs. The majority of the Companys revenues are earned within North America. Revenues outside of North America totaled $17.7 million, $22.1 million, and $25.4 million in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively, based upon where the customers are located. Revenues from customers located outside of North America have been generated primarily in the United Kingdom and Germany. As a percentage of revenues, revenues outside of North America represented 19.9%, 16.1% and 14.3% in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The primary denomination for invoices issued by the Company is U.S. dollars, with the exception of invoices issued in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. Invoices issued in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom are issued in local currency. Gains and losses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a significant impact on historical results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RISKS Financial Reporting Release No. 60, which was recently released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the Company. 23 In addition, Financial Reporting Release No. 61 was recently released by the SEC to require all companies to include a discussion to address, among other things, liquidity, off balance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for warranties, reserves for employee benefits, income taxes, depreciation of fixed assets and long lived assets, contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for fixed bid contracts. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could vary from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. All of the Companys software development centers, including a substantial majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. To date, the Company has not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Companys services are entered into on either a T&M or fixed price basis. Revenues related to T&M contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of performance, including estimated earnings thereon, is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Fixed price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related 24 to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting, are recognized as either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. A reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts, which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary ("CTS India"), the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between CTS India and its U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in other income. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Additionally, the Company provides deferred taxes on the earnings of its Indian subsidiary based on the assumption that those earnings will be repatriated. Should the Company subsequently be unable to repatriate such earnings based on regulatory or other factors, or decide not to repatriate these or future earnings, an adjustment to the deferred tax liability account would be credited to income in the period of such determination. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 2000 2001 Total revenues......................................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenues....................................... 51.9 51.4 51.1 Gross profit....................................... 48.1 48.6 48.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses........... 25.9 26.2 25.3 Depreciation and amortization expense.................. 3.4 3.3 3.6 Income from operations............................. 18.8 19.1 20.0 Other income (expense): Interest income.................................... 1.4 1.9 1.4 Impairment loss on Investment (1.1) Other income (expense).............................

(7.6) (7.7) (7.4) Net income............................................ 12.6% 12.9% 12.5% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 29.7%, or $40.7 million, from $137.0 million during 2000 to $177.8 million in 2001. This increase resulted primarily from a $27.7 million (42.9%) increase in application management and a $13.5 million (18.8%) increase in application development and integration, partially offset by an approximately $0.5 million (100.0%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The Company provides services through T&M and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of revenues from 15.0% in 1999 to 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were relatively stable at 10.6% in 2001 compared to 10.4% in 2000. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2000, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 29.0%, or $20.4 million, from $70.4 million during 2000 to $90.8 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000 to approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services. The Companys 26 gross profit increased by 30.5%, or approximately $20.3 million, from approximately $66.6 million during 2000 to $86.9 during 2001. Gross profit margin increased from 48.6% of revenues during 2000 to 48.9% of revenues in 2001. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 26.8%, or $10.8 million, from $40.5 million during 2000 to $51.3 million during 2001, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.5% to 28.9%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Companys expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 36.3%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $26.1 million during 2000 to $35.6 million during 2001, representing approximately 19.1% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment. Interest income decreased by approximately 5.6%, from $2.6 million during 2000 to $2.5 million during 2001. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Company had been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. The Companys provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Companys stand alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from $10.6 million in 2000 to $13.2 million in 2001, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both years. The provision for income taxes reflects the Companys intent to repatriate earnings from its Indian subsidiary. 27 NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $17.7 million in 2000 to $22.2 million in 2001, representing approximately 12.9% and 12.5% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The lower percentage in 2001 reflects the one time write off of the Companys investment in Questra, discussed previously. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company, operating globally, provides software services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of software services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of software services principally in the United Kingdom. Asian operations consist of software services principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by the Companys chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. Revenues and resulting operating income are attributed to regions based upon customer location. North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 32.6%, or approximately $37.5 million, from approximately $114.9 million during 2000 to approximately $152.4 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 39.3%, or approximately $8.6 million, from approximately $21.9 million during 2000 to approximately $30.5 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 10.2%, or approximately $2.1 million, from approximately $21.0 million during 2000 to approximately $23.1 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Companys services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 16.0%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.0 million during 2000 to $4.6 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 98.6%, or $1.1 million, from $1.1 million during 2000 to $2.2 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Companys success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies as well as to Indian divisions of the Companys multi national clients. 28 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 109.3%, or approximately $0.2 million, from approximately $0.2 million during 2000 to $0.5 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 54.1%, or $48.1 million, from $88.9 million during 1999 to $137.0 million in 2000. This increase resulted primarily from a $61.5 million (82.0%) increase in application development and integration, application management, re engineering and other services partially offset by an approximately $13.4 million (96.5%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The percentage of revenues derived from unrelated parties increased from 83.3% during 1999 to 89.6% during 2000. This increase resulted from the Companys continued effort to pursue unaffiliated third party customers and expanded service offerings to existing unaffiliated customers. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2000, sales to related party customers accounted for 10.4% of revenues and no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. During 1999, sales to related party customers accounted for 16.7% of revenues and one third party customer accounted for 17.4% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 52.6%, or $24.3 million, from $46.2 million during 1999 to $70.4 million during 2000. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 2,000 employees at December 31, 1999 to approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services. The Companys gross profit increased by 55.8%, or approximately $23.9 million, from approximately $42.7 million during 1999 to approximately $66.6 million during 2000. Gross profit margin increased from 48.1% of revenues during 1999 to 48.6% of revenues during 2000. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the increased third party revenue and the shift toward newer, higher margin customers. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or $14.4 million, from $26.1 million during 1999 to $40.5 million during 2000, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.4% to 29.5%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys revenue growth. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 57.0%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $16.6 million during 1999 to approximately $26.1 million during 2000, representing approximately 18.7% and 19.1% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to the increased third party revenue and the shift toward newer, higher margin customers. 29 OTHER INCOME. Interest income increased by approximately 109.7%, from $1.3 million during 1999 to approximately $2.6 million during 2000. The increase in such interest income was attributable primarily to generally higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $538,000 during 2000, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Companys provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Companys stand alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from $6.7 million in 1999 to $10.6 million in 2000, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both 1999 and 2000. NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $11.2 million in 1999 to approximately $17.7 million in 2000, representing approximately 12.6% and 12.9% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 61.5%, or approximately $43.8 million, from approximately $71.2 million during 1999 to approximately $114.9 million in 2000. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 64.4%, or approximately $8.6 million, from approximately $13.3 million during 1999 to approximately $21.9 million during 2000. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 20.8%, or approximately $3.6 million, from approximately $17.4 million during 1999 to approximately $21.0 million in 2000. The increase in revenue was attributable the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 23.1%, or approximately $0.7 million, from approximately $3.2 million during 1999 to approximately $4.0 million during 2000. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 199.2%, or $0.8 million, from approximately $0.4 million during 1999 to approximately $1.2 million in 2000. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Companys success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies. 30 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 100.0%, or approximately $0.1 million, from approximately $0.1 million during 1999 to approximately $0.2 million during 2000. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Companys primary sources of funding had been cash flow from operations and intercompany cash transfers with its majority owner and controlling parent company Cognizant Corporation and IMS Health. In June 1998, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 5,834,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock at a price to the public of $5.00 per share, of which 5,000,000 shares were issued and sold by the Company and 834,000 shares were sold, at that time, by Cognizant Corporation. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $22.4 million after $845,000 of direct expenses. The funds received by the Company from the initial public offering were invested in short term, investment grade, interest bearing securities, after the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately $6.6 million of then existing non trade related party balances to Cognizant Corporation. The Company has used and plans to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering as well as other cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including its offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related businesses including cost and equity investments; and (iii) general corporate purposes including working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $32.1 million, $30.2 million and $19.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from increased tax benefits related to stock plans, increased depreciation and amortization, a smaller increase in accounts receivable and increased net income, offset, in part, by decreased levels of year end accrued liabilities and accounts payable, due primarily to the timing of payments. The increase for 2000 compared to 1999 results primarily from increased levels of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, increased net income and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset, in part, by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets. Trade accounts receivable increased from $10.0 million at December 31, 1999 to $20.5 million at December 31, 2000 and to $22.5 million at December 31, 2001. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from $1.1 million at December 31, 1999 to $1.9 million at December 31, 2000 and to $5.4 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2001 was due primarily to increased revenue. The increase in unbilled accounts receivable in 2001 compared to prior years was primarily related to the increase in the percentage of revenues derived from fixed bid contracts and the related timing of contractual billings. The Company monitors turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports which are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by the Companys finance staff. At December 31, 2001, the Companys days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 59 days, as compared to 50 days and 43 days at December 31, 2000 and 1999. The Companys investing activities used net cash of $14.9 million, $12.6 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily reflects the Companys increased purchases of land, buildings and equipment to expand the Companys offshore development infrastructure. The increase in 31 2000 of net cash used in investing activities compared to 1999 primarily reflects an increase in purchases of property and equipment. In June 2000, the Company announced a strategic relationship with Trident Capital, a leading venture capital firm, to jointly invest in emerging e business service and technology companies. In accordance with this strategy, the Company invested approximately $2 million in Questra Corporation, an e business software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for an initial 5.8% equity interest. Trident Capital also independently made a direct investment in Questra Corporation. Based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights, the Company recorded an impairment loss for the full $2.0 million original investment in recognition of an other than temporary impairment. The Companys investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Companys financing activities provided net cash of $6.0 million, $1.8 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. The Company believes that its available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations, will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. The Companys ability to expand and grow its business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet its long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which its cash flow increases, its ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock and the availability to the Company of public and private debt and equity financing. The Company cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to it, if at all. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $85 million and $62 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000 the Company had no significant third party debt. The Company had working capital of approximately $95.6 and $61.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments related to its India development center expansion program of approximately $10.7 million, of which $7.6 million has been spent to date. The multi phase program will encompass the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 600,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Calcutta. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $35.6 million, which the Company expects to fund internally. The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2010. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. 32 Approximate future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2001 are as follows: 2002.....................................................$4.8 million 2003......................................................4.3 million 2004......................................................2.8 million 2005......................................................1.4 million 2006......................................................0.8 million Thereafter................................................2.0 million Total minimum lease payments............................$16.1 million The Company does not engage in hedging activities nor has it entered into transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES As indicated in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into various agreements with IMS Health, who owned a majority and controlling interest in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company (58.3%) and held approximately 93.3% of the combined voting power of the Companys Common Stock at December 31, 2001. IMS Health currently provides the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permits the Company to participate in IMS Healths business insurance plans. In prior periods, IMS Health provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have now been transitioned to the Company. Costs for all periods prior to the Companys IPO were allocated to the Company based on utilization of certain specific services. All subsequent services were performed and charged to the Company under the CTS/IMS Health intercompany services agreement that was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides IT services to IMS Health. The IT services are provided to IMS Health on terms that are comparable to unrelated third parties. The same is true for IT services provided to former affiliates of D&B and Cognizant Corporation, former parents of the Company, and former and present affiliates of IMS Health. In 2001, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $18.8 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2000, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $14.3 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies (through August 30, 2000). In 1999, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $14.8 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies. In December 2001, the Company paid IMS Health a one time fee of approximately $825,000 under an alliance agreement in which the Company was named "vendor of choice" for IT services to the pharmaceutical industry. This agreement was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. 33 In addition, the Company has a certain relationship with Erisco, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Trizetto Group, Inc. ("Trizetto"). As of December 31, 2001, IMS Health owned approximately 26.8% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. During 2001 the Company recorded revenues from Erisco of approximately $401,000 and payments to Erisco for commissions and marketing fees of approximately $1.0 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars; and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between the Indian subsidiary and the Companys U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. A portion of the Companys costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on the Companys results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Companys most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for its programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India and the United States for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services offered by the Company have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, the Company must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on its fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that it charges for its services in the United States and elsewhere. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS During 2000 and 2001, various new accounting pronouncements were issued which may impact the Companys financial statements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company delivers high quality, cost effective, full life cycle solutions to complex software development and maintenance problems that companies face as they transition to e business. These IT services are delivered through the use of a seamless on site and offshore consulting project team. The Companys service offerings include: o application development and integration; o application management; and o re engineering. During 1996, the Company made a strategic decision to attract customers that were not affiliated with Cognizant Corporation or any of the former affiliates of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation. As a result of the implementation of this strategy, the Company has successfully transitioned from a company primarily serving affiliated customers to a company whose customer base now consists primarily of unaffiliated third parties. For example, revenues derived from customers not currently or previously affiliated with The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, Cognizant Corporation, IMS Health, and any of their respective subsidiaries grew from $50.5 million, or 56.8% of revenues, in 1999 to $92.3 million, or 67.4% of revenues, in 2000 and to $129 million, or 72.3% of revenues in 2001. Approximately 43.2%, 32.6% and 27.7% of the Companys revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, were generated from current and former affiliates including approximately 16.7%, 10.4% and 10.6%, respectively, from IMS Health and its current subsidiaries. The Company has derived and believes that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of large third party customers. During 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Companys five largest customers (other than IMS Health and its current subsidiaries) accounted for 44.9%, 34.5% and 28.5% of revenues, respectively. In 1999, IMS Health and First Data Corporation accounted for more than 10.0% of revenue. In 2000 and 2001, IMS Health accounted for more than 10.0% of revenues. The volume of work performed for IMS Health and its subsidiaries and other customers is likely to vary from year to year. Major customers, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, in one year may not provide the same level of revenues in any subsequent year. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 have significantly impacted our travel industry customers, which represent approximately 5% of revenues. In addition, we expect short term logistical delays in launching new initiatives for existing and new customers. There is no evidence that these events have changed our customers strategy of doing business in India. Prior to fiscal 2000, Year 2000 compliance services were an important element of the Companys service offerings. Approximately 15.6% and 0.4% of the Companys revenues were derived from Year 2000 compliance services in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The Company 22 believes that it has successfully utilized its Year 2000 compliance expertise to establish new client relationships and to deepen its relationships with existing customers. The knowledge of customers systems gained while performing Year 2000 compliance services gave the Company a competitive advantage in securing additional application development and application management projects for such customers. Application development and integration services represented approximately 32.3%, 46.1% and 42.9% of revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Application management services accounted for 44.0%, 47.0% and 51.8% of revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Companys services are performed on either a time and materials or fixed price basis. Revenues related to time and materials contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under such method, the sales value of performance, including earnings thereon, is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated contract cost. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses, to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates of the percentage of work completed is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in the estimate becomes known. Additionally, any anticipated losses are recognized immediately. Since the Company bears the risk of cost over runs and inflation associated with fixed price projects, the Companys operating results may be adversely affected by changes in estimates of contract completion costs. The majority of the Companys revenues are earned within North America. Revenues outside of North America totaled $17.7 million, $22.1 million, and $25.4 million in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively, based upon where the customers are located. Revenues from customers located outside of North America have been generated primarily in the United Kingdom and Germany. As a percentage of revenues, revenues outside of North America represented 19.9%, 16.1% and 14.3% in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The primary denomination for invoices issued by the Company is U.S. dollars, with the exception of invoices issued in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. Invoices issued in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom are issued in local currency. Gains and losses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a significant impact on historical results of operations. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RISKS Financial Reporting Release No. 60, which was recently released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the Company. 23 In addition, Financial Reporting Release No. 61 was recently released by the SEC to require all companies to include a discussion to address, among other things, liquidity, off balance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for warranties, reserves for employee benefits, income taxes, depreciation of fixed assets and long lived assets, contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for fixed bid contracts. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could vary from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. All of the Companys software development centers, including a substantial majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. To date, the Company has not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Companys services are entered into on either a T&M or fixed price basis. Revenues related to T&M contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of performance, including estimated earnings thereon, is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Fixed price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related 24 to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting, are recognized as either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. A reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts, which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary ("CTS India"), the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between CTS India and its U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in other income. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Additionally, the Company provides deferred taxes on the earnings of its Indian subsidiary based on the assumption that those earnings will be repatriated. Should the Company subsequently be unable to repatriate such earnings based on regulatory or other factors, or decide not to repatriate these or future earnings, an adjustment to the deferred tax liability account would be credited to income in the period of such determination. 25 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 2000 2001 Total revenues......................................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenues....................................... 51.9 51.4 51.1 Gross profit....................................... 48.1 48.6 48.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses........... 25.9 26.2 25.3 Depreciation and amortization expense.................. 3.4 3.3 3.6 Income from operations............................. 18.8 19.1 20.0 Other income (expense): Interest income.................................... 1.4 1.9 1.4 Impairment loss on Investment (1.1) Other income (expense)............................. (0.4) (0.4) Total other income..................................... 1.4 1.5 (0.1) Income before provision for income taxes............... 20.2 20.6 19.9 Provision for income taxes............................. (7.6) (7.7) (7.4) Net income............................................ 12.6% 12.9% 12.5% YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 29.7%, or $40.7 million, from $137.0 million during 2000 to $177.8 million in 2001. This increase resulted primarily from a $27.7 million (42.9%) increase in application management and a $13.5 million (18.8%) increase in application development and integration, partially offset by an approximately $0.5 million (100.0%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The Company provides services through T&M and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of revenues from 15.0% in 1999 to 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were relatively stable at 10.6% in 2001 compared to 10.4% in 2000. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2000, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 29.0%, or $20.4 million, from $70.4 million during 2000 to $90.8 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000 to approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services. The Companys 26 gross profit increased by 30.5%, or approximately $20.3 million, from approximately $66.6 million during 2000 to $86.9 during 2001. Gross profit margin increased from 48.6% of revenues during 2000 to 48.9% of revenues in 2001. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 26.8%, or $10.8 million, from $40.5 million during 2000 to $51.3 million during 2001, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.5% to 28.9%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Companys expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 36.3%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $26.1 million during 2000 to $35.6 million during 2001, representing approximately 19.1% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment. Interest income decreased by approximately 5.6%, from $2.6 million during 2000 to $2.5 million during 2001. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Company had been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. The Companys provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Companys stand alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from $10.6 million in 2000 to $13.2 million in 2001, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both years. The provision for income taxes reflects the Companys intent to repatriate earnings from its Indian subsidiary. 27 NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $17.7 million in 2000 to $22.2 million in 2001, representing approximately 12.9% and 12.5% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The lower percentage in 2001 reflects the one time write off of the Companys investment in Questra, discussed previously. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company, operating globally, provides software services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of software services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of software services principally in the United Kingdom. Asian operations consist of software services principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by the Companys chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. Revenues and resulting operating income are attributed to regions based upon customer location. North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 32.6%, or approximately $37.5 million, from approximately $114.9 million during 2000 to approximately $152.4 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 39.3%, or approximately $8.6 million, from approximately $21.9 million during 2000 to approximately $30.5 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 10.2%, or approximately $2.1 million, from approximately $21.0 million during 2000 to approximately $23.1 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Companys services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 16.0%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.0 million during 2000 to $4.6 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 98.6%, or $1.1 million, from $1.1 million during 2000 to $2.2 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Companys success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies as well as to Indian divisions of the Companys multi national clients. 28 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 109.3%, or approximately $0.2 million, from approximately $0.2 million during 2000 to $0.5 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 54.1%, or $48.1 million, from $88.9 million during 1999 to $137.0 million in 2000. This increase resulted primarily from a $61.5 million (82.0%) increase in application development and integration, application management, re engineering and other services partially offset by an approximately $13.4 million (96.5%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The percentage of revenues derived from unrelated parties increased from 83.3% during 1999 to 89.6% during 2000. This increase resulted from the Companys continued effort to pursue unaffiliated third party customers and expanded service offerings to existing unaffiliated customers. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2000, sales to related party customers accounted for 10.4% of revenues and no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. During 1999, sales to related party customers accounted for 16.7% of revenues and one third party customer accounted for 17.4% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 52.6%, or $24.3 million, from $46.2 million during 1999 to $70.4 million during 2000. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 2,000 employees at December 31, 1999 to approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services. The Companys gross profit increased by 55.8%, or approximately $23.9 million, from approximately $42.7 million during 1999 to approximately $66.6 million during 2000. Gross profit margin increased from 48.1% of revenues during 1999 to 48.6% of revenues during 2000. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the increased third party revenue and the shift toward newer, higher margin customers. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or $14.4 million, from $26.1 million during 1999 to $40.5 million during 2000, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.4% to 29.5%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys revenue growth. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 57.0%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $16.6 million during 1999 to approximately $26.1 million during 2000, representing approximately 18.7% and 19.1% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to the increased third party revenue and the shift toward newer, higher margin customers. 29 OTHER INCOME. Interest income increased by approximately 109.7%, from $1.3 million during 1999 to approximately $2.6 million during 2000. The increase in such interest income was attributable primarily to generally higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $538,000 during 2000, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Companys provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Companys stand alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from $6.7 million in 1999 to $10.6 million in 2000, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both 1999 and 2000. NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $11.2 million in 1999 to approximately $17.7 million in 2000, representing approximately 12.6% and 12.9% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 61.5%, or approximately $43.8 million, from approximately $71.2 million during 1999 to approximately $114.9 million in 2000. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 64.4%, or approximately $8.6 million, from approximately $13.3 million during 1999 to approximately $21.9 million during 2000. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 20.8%, or approximately $3.6 million, from approximately $17.4 million during 1999 to approximately $21.0 million in 2000. The increase in revenue was attributable the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 23.1%, or approximately $0.7 million, from approximately $3.2 million during 1999 to approximately $4.0 million during 2000. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 199.2%, or $0.8 million, from approximately $0.4 million during 1999 to approximately $1.2 million in 2000. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Companys success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies. 30 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 100.0%, or approximately $0.1 million, from approximately $0.1 million during 1999 to approximately $0.2 million during 2000. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Companys primary sources of funding had been cash flow from operations and intercompany cash transfers with its majority owner and controlling parent company Cognizant Corporation and IMS Health. In June 1998, the Company consummated its initial public offering of 5,834,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock at a price to the public of $5.00 per share, of which 5,000,000 shares were issued and sold by the Company and 834,000 shares were sold, at that time, by Cognizant Corporation. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering were approximately $22.4 million after $845,000 of direct expenses. The funds received by the Company from the initial public offering were invested in short term, investment grade, interest bearing securities, after the Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately $6.6 million of then existing non trade related party balances to Cognizant Corporation. The Company has used and plans to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering as well as other cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including its offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related businesses including cost and equity investments; and (iii) general corporate purposes including working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $32.1 million, $30.2 million and $19.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from increased tax benefits related to stock plans, increased depreciation and amortization, a smaller increase in accounts receivable and increased net income, offset, in part, by decreased levels of year end accrued liabilities and accounts payable, due primarily to the timing of payments. The increase for 2000 compared to 1999 results primarily from increased levels of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, increased net income and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset, in part, by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets. Trade accounts receivable increased from $10.0 million at December 31, 1999 to $20.5 million at December 31, 2000 and to $22.5 million at December 31, 2001. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from $1.1 million at December 31, 1999 to $1.9 million at December 31, 2000 and to $5.4 million at December 31, 2001. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2001 was due primarily to increased revenue. The increase in unbilled accounts receivable in 2001 compared to prior years was primarily related to the increase in the percentage of revenues derived from fixed bid contracts and the related timing of contractual billings. The Company monitors turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports which are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by the Companys finance staff. At December 31, 2001, the Companys days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 59 days, as compared to 50 days and 43 days at December 31, 2000 and 1999. The Companys investing activities used net cash of $14.9 million, $12.6 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 primarily reflects the Companys increased purchases of land, buildings and equipment to expand the Companys offshore development infrastructure. The increase in 31 2000 of net cash used in investing activities compared to 1999 primarily reflects an increase in purchases of property and equipment. In June 2000, the Company announced a strategic relationship with Trident Capital, a leading venture capital firm, to jointly invest in emerging e business service and technology companies. In accordance with this strategy, the Company invested approximately $2 million in Questra Corporation, an e business software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for an initial 5.8% equity interest. Trident Capital also independently made a direct investment in Questra Corporation. Based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights, the Company recorded an impairment loss for the full $2.0 million original investment in recognition of an other than temporary impairment. The Companys investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Companys financing activities provided net cash of $6.0 million, $1.8 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. The Company believes that its available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations, will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. The Companys ability to expand and grow its business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet its long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which its cash flow increases, its ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock and the availability to the Company of public and private debt and equity financing. The Company cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to it, if at all. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $85 million and $62 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000 the Company had no significant third party debt. The Company had working capital of approximately $95.6 and $61.5 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments related to its India development center expansion program of approximately $10.7 million, of which $7.6 million has been spent to date. The multi phase program will encompass the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 600,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Calcutta. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $35.6 million, which the Company expects to fund internally. The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2010. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. 32 Approximate future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2001 are as follows: 2002.....................................................$4.8 million 2003......................................................4.3 million 2004......................................................2.8 million 2005......................................................1.4 million 2006......................................................0.8 million Thereafter................................................2.0 million Total minimum lease payments............................$16.1 million The Company does not engage in hedging activities nor has it entered into transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES As indicated in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into various agreements with IMS Health, who owned a majority and controlling interest in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company (58.3%) and held approximately 93.3% of the combined voting power of the Companys Common Stock at December 31, 2001. IMS Health currently provides the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permits the Company to participate in IMS Healths business insurance plans. In prior periods, IMS Health provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have now been transitioned to the Company. Costs for all periods prior to the Companys IPO were allocated to the Company based on utilization of certain specific services. All subsequent services were performed and charged to the Company under the CTS/IMS Health intercompany services agreement that was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides IT services to IMS Health. The IT services are provided to IMS Health on terms that are comparable to unrelated third parties. The same is true for IT services provided to former affiliates of D&B and Cognizant Corporation, former parents of the Company, and former and present affiliates of IMS Health. In 2001, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $18.8 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2000, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $14.3 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies (through August 30, 2000). In 1999, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $14.8 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies. In December 2001, the Company paid IMS Health a one time fee of approximately $825,000 under an alliance agreement in which the Company was named "vendor of choice" for IT services to the pharmaceutical industry. This agreement was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. 33 In addition, the Company has a certain relationship with Erisco, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Trizetto Group, Inc. ("Trizetto"). As of December 31, 2001, IMS Health owned approximately 26.8% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. During 2001 the Company recorded revenues from Erisco of approximately $401,000 and payments to Erisco for commissions and marketing fees of approximately $1.0 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars; and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between the Indian subsidiary and the Companys U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. A portion of the Companys costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on the Companys results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Companys most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for its programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India and the United States for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services offered by the Company have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, the Company must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on its fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that it charges for its services in the United States and elsewhere.
