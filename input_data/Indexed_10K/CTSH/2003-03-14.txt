MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL Cognizant is a leading provider of custom IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in the United States and Europe. Cognizants core competencies include web centric applications, data warehousing, component based development and legacy and client server systems. Cognizant provides the IT services it offers using an integrated on site/offshore business model. This seamless onsite/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located in India and Ireland. Cognizant began its IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun off from the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant completed its initial public offering. On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health Incorporated ("IMS Health"). Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding stock of Cognizant (representing all of Cognizants Class B common stock) and held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizants common stock. Holders of Cognizants Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizants Class B common stock have ten votes per share. On June 30, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of UHCI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. UHCI previously provided, and will continue to provide through CTS Ireland, application development and maintenance services, using the existing staff of approximately 70 software professionals. This acquisition is designed to enable the Company to provide a wide range of services to the Companys clients in Europe and worldwide and represents the initial implementation of the Companys previously announced international expansion strategy. Additionally, on October 29, 2002, the Company completed the transfer of Silverline Technologies, Inc.s practice, which serviced a major financial services company to the Company. Under the terms of the transfer, the Company will provide application design, development and maintenance services to such major financial services company through an acquired workforce of approximately three hundred IT and support professionals located primarily in the United States and India. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned (a total of 11,290,900 shares) in an exchange offer to its stockholders. IMS Health distributed 0.309 shares of Cognizant Class B common stock to its stockholders for every one share of IMS Healths common stock tendered. There was no impact on the number of Cognizants total shares of common stock outstanding as a result of the completion of the exchange offer. As a direct result of the IMS Health exchange offer Cognizant has incurred charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $1.7 million and expects total charges 28 aggregating approximately $3.5 million. Such charges primarily relate to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. In addition, total estimated charges include approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split off. As of February 21, 2003, pursuant to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common stock converted into shares of Class A common stock. Accordingly, as of such date, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RISKS Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the Company. In addition, Financial Reporting Release No. 61 requires all companies to include a discussion to address, among other things, liquidity, off balance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for warranties, reserves for employee benefits, income taxes, depreciation of fixed assets and long lived assets, contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. Most of the Companys IT development centers, including a substantial majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign 29 policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. To date, the Company has not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Companys services are entered into on either a time and materials or fixed price basis. Revenues related to time and material contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed price contracts that provide for application development services or that provide for a combination of application development and application management services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of performance is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Revenues related to fixed priced contracts that provided solely for application management services are recognized on a straight line basis or as services are rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contract terms. Expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus in EITF 00 21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". The consensus, which is effective for contracts entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, requires that a Company evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. That evaluation must be performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered. Arrangement consideration should be then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. EITF 00 21 indicates that the best evidence of fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis. Fair value evidence often consists of entity specific or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. The Company enters into contracts that could be considered arrangements with multiple deliverables. These contracts are primarily long term fixed bid contracts that provide both application maintenance and application development services. As indicated above and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company accounts for such contracts using percentage of completion accounting. The Company is currently evaluating the prospective impact of EITF 00 21 on the Companys results of operations related to contracts entered into after June 15, 2003. Fixed price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting, are recognized as 30 either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. A reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts, which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period. Revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when agreements or work orders are signed or payment is received; however the cost related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services are rendered. Such revenue is recognized when, and if, evidence of an arrangement is obtained. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary ("CTS India"), the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between CTS India and its U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in other income. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Cognizants Indian subsidiary, CTS India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of CTS India are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 90% exemption from Indian income tax. 31 These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and under current law will be completely phased out by March of 2009. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, Cognizant has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24.9 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, Cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, Cognizant intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Bulletin 23, Cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on the repatriation of earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately $30.1 million. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, Cognizant will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation. This change in intent, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India, resulted in an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 23.4%. This rate compares to an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 37.4%. Effective April 1, 2002, the government of India passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which the Companys earnings are taxed in India. The tax exemption for export earnings was reduced from 100% to 90%, a surtax was imposed increasing the effective rate from 35.7% to 36.75% for income that is subject to tax, and the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was replaced with a withholding tax on dividends. Cognizants cash requirements could change over time, which could effectively force it to change its intent on repatriating Indian earnings. If Cognizants earnings are intended to be repatriated in the future, or are no longer reinvested outside the United States, Cognizant will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2002. These increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on Cognizants business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as cash flows to fund such taxes. In addition, Cognizant may need to accelerate the payment of significant deferred taxes, which would have a significant impact on its cash position. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Prior to 2002, goodwill, which related to the acquisition of the former minority interest in the Companys Indian subsidiary, was amortized using the straight line basis over a period of seven years. Effective January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142"), the Company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance; however, at each balance date, the Company does evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. If such assets were determined to 32 be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on Cognizants business, results of operations and financial condition. LONG LIVED ASSETS. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets", which was adopted in 2002, the Company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, the Company will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue: 2000 2001 2002 Total revenues............................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenues............................. 51.4 51.1 53.6 Gross profit............................. 48.6 48.9 46.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses. 26.2 25.3 23.3 Depreciation and amortization expense........ 3.3 3.6 3.4 Income from operations................... 19.1 20.0 19.7 Other income (expense): Interest income.......................... 1.9 1.4 0.8 Split off costs..........................

(7.7) (7.4) (4.6) Net income.................................. 12.9% 12.5% 15.1% 33 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 28.9%, or approximately $51.3 million, from approximately $177.8 million during 2001 to approximately $229.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in application management and application development and integration services. The Company provides services through time and materials ("T&M") and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years revenues recognized under fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001 and 24.6% in 2002. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand for such services due to the customers ability to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were 10.6% in 2001 compared to 8.9% in 2002. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2002, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 35.1%, or approximately $31.9 million, from approximately $90.8 million during 2001 to approximately $122.7 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001 to over 6,100 employees at December 31, 2002. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services and on employees acquired through acquisitions. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Companys gross profit increased by 22.4%, or approximately $19.5 million, from approximately $86.9 million during 2001 to approximately $106.4 million during 2002. Gross profit margin decreased from 48.9% of revenues during 2001 to 46.4% of revenues in 2002. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to the significantly increased performance of the Company. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 19.2%, or approximately $9.9 million, from approximately $51.3 million during 2001 to approximately $61.2 million during 2002, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 28.9% to 26.7%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Companys expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. 34 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, from approximately $35.6 million during 2001 to approximately $45.2 million during 2002, representing approximately 20.0% and 19.7% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment, and in 2002, split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health has offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of the Companys Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income decreased by approximately 27.7%, from approximately $2.5 million during 2001 to approximately $1.8 million during 2002. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001 compared to an exchange loss of approximately $235,000 during 2002, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company recognized split off costs of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the exchange offer and expects total charges aggregating approximately $3.5 million in relation to one time costs associated with the exchange offer. Such charges primarily relate to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. In addition, total estimated charges include approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split off. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $13.2 million in 2001 to approximately $10.5 million in 2002, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in 2001 and 23.4% in 2002. The lower effective tax rate reflects Cognizants change in its intention regarding the repatriation of 2002 and future earnings from its subsidiary in India, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $22.2 million in 2001 to approximately $34.6 million in 2002, representing approximately 12.5% and 15.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2002 primarily reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. 35 RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company, operating globally, provides software services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of software services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of software services principally in the United Kingdom. Asian operations consist of software services principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by the Companys chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. In this regard, revenues are allocated to each geographic area based on the location of the customer. North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 31.4%, or approximately $47.7 million, from approximately $151.9 million during 2001 to approximately $199.6 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 29.4%, or approximately $8.9 million, from approximately $30.4 million during 2001 to approximately $39.4 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.1%, or approximately $3.7 million, from approximately $24.2 million during 2001 to approximately $27.9 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Companys services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 13.2%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.9 million during 2001 to approximately $5.5 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $1.6 million in each year. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $0.3 million in each year. 36 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 29.7%, or approximately $40.7 million, from approximately $137.0 million during 2000 to approximately $177.8 million in 2001. This increase resulted primarily from approximately a $27.7 million (42.9%) increase in application management and approximately a $13.5 million (18.8%) increase in application development and integration, partially offset by an approximately $0.5 million (100.0%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The Company provides services through T&M and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of revenues from 15.0% in 1999 to 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were relatively stable at 10.6% in 2001 compared to 10.4% in 2000. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2000, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 29.0%, or approximately $20.4 million, from approximately $70.4 million during 2000 to approximately $90.8 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000 to approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services. The Companys gross profit increased by 30.5%, or approximately $20.3 million, from approximately $66.6 million during 2000 to approximately $86.9 during 2001. Gross profit margin increased from 48.6% of revenues during 2000 to 48.9% of revenues in 2001. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 26.8%, or approximately $10.8 million, from approximately $40.5 million during 2000 to approximately $51.3 million during 2001, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.5% to 28.9%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Companys expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 36.3%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $26.1 million during 2000 to approximately $35.6 million during 2001, representing approximately 19.1% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The 37 increase in operating margin was primarily due to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment. Interest income decreased by approximately 5.6%, from approximately $2.6 million during 2000 to approximately $2.5 million during 2001. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Company had been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. The Companys provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Companys stand alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.6 million in 2000 to approximately $13.2 million in 2001, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both years. The provision for income taxes reflects the Companys intent to repatriate earnings from its Indian subsidiary. NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $17.7 million in 2000 to approximately $22.2 million in 2001, representing approximately 12.9% and 12.5% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The lower percentage in 2001 reflects the one time write off of the Companys investment in Questra, discussed previously. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 32.2%, or approximately $37.0 million, from approximately $114.9 million during 2000 to approximately $151.9 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 38.9%, or approximately $8.5 million, from approximately $21.9 million during 2000 to approximately $30.4 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. 38 European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.6%, or approximately $3.3 million, from approximately $21.0 million during 2000 to approximately $24.2 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Companys services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 21.7%, or approximately $0.9 million, from approximately $4.0 million during 2000 to approximately $4.9 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 42.5%, or approximately $0.5 million, from approximately $1.1 million during 2000 to approximately $1.6 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Companys success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies as well as to Indian divisions of the Companys multi national clients. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 50.5%, or approximately $0.1 million, from approximately $0.2 million during 2000 to approximately $0.3 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million. The Company has used and plans to use such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including its offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related businesses, and formation of joint ventures; and (iii) general corporate purposes, including working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $56.7 million, $32.1 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from increased net income, increased accrued employee incentive payments, which resulted in higher levels of year end accrued liabilities, increased tax benefits related to stock plans, offset, in part, by a greater increase in accounts receivable then the prior year. The increase in 2001 as compared to 2000 results primarily from increased levels of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, increased net income and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset, by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $20.5 million at December 31, 2000 to approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2001 and to approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2000 and to approximately $5.4 million at December 31, 2001 and decreased to approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2002 was due primarily to increased revenue. The decrease in unbilled accounts 39 receivable in 2002 compared to the prior year was primarily related to timing of fixed bid contractual billings. The Company monitors turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports which are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by the Companys finance staff. At December 31, 2002, the Companys days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 56 days as compared to 59 days and 50 days at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys investing activities used net cash of approximately $35.5 million, $14.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflects the Companys increased purchases of property and equipment to expand the Companys offshore development infrastructure and the acquisitions of intangible assets related to UHCI and Silverline Technologies, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The increase in 2001 of net cash used in investing activities as compared to 2000 primarily reflects an increase in purchases of property and equipment. In June 2000, the Company announced a strategic relationship with Trident Capital, a leading venture capital firm, to jointly invest in emerging e business service and technology companies. In accordance with this strategy, the Company invested approximately $2 million in Questra, an e business software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for an initial 5.8% equity interest. Trident Capital also independently made a direct investment in Questra. Based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights, the Company recorded an impairment loss for the full $2.0 million original investment in recognition of an other than temporary impairment. The Companys investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Companys financing activities provided net cash of approximately $20 million, $6 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. The Company believes that its available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations, will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. The Companys ability to expand and grow its business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet its long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which its cash flow increases, its ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, its continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, its ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, between the Company and IMS Health (the "Distribution Agreement"), especially as it relates to tax indemnities and the availability to the Company of public and private debt and equity financing. The Company cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to it, if at all. 40 At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million and $85 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 the Company had no significant third party debt. The Company had working capital of approximately $134.3 and $95.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. The Company does not engage in hedging activities nor has it entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As of December 31, 2002, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments related to its India development center expansion program of approximately $28.8 million, of which approximately $19.2 million has been spent. The multi phase program will encompass the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 620,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Calcutta. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $35.6 million, which the Company expects to fund internally. The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2011. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002 are as follows: 2003................................................................$5,799 2004.................................................................3,829 2005.................................................................2,229 2006.................................................................1,755 2007.................................................................1,252 Thereafter...........................................................2,090 Total minimum lease payments.......................................$16,954 Cognizant is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Cognizants quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of Cognizants engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against Cognizant, regardless of Cognizants responsibility for such failure. Although Cognizant attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering its application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect Cognizant from liability for damages. Although Cognizant has general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient 41 amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against Cognizant that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in Cognizants insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on Cognizants business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of the IMS Health split off, the Company has entered into certain agreements and indemnifications (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES As indicated in Notes 1 and 9 and 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has entered into various agreements with IMS Health, who owned a majority and controlling interest in the outstanding common stock of the Company (55.3%) and held approximately 92.5% of the combined voting power of the Companys common stock at December 31, 2002. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health completed its plan to distribute all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in the exchange offer, which is the subject of Amendment No. 4 to Form S 4 Registration Statement filed by the Company on January 30, 2003. As of the completion of such distribution, IMS Health is no longer a related party of Cognizant. INTERCOMPANY SERVICES AGREEMENT Prior to the consummation of the exchange offer, pursuant to the terms of an Intercompany Services Agreement, dated as of May 15, 1998, IMS Health provided the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permitted the Company to participate in IMS Healths business insurance plans. In prior periods, IMS Health provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have now been transitioned to the Company. Costs for all periods prior to the Companys IPO were allocated to the Company based on utilization of certain specific services. All subsequent services were performed and charged to the Company under the CTS/IMS Health intercompany services agreement that was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. IMS Health and Cognizant entered into an amended and restated Intercompany Services Agreement, effective following the consummation of the exchange offer, which provides for the continued provision of payroll, payables processing and certain other administrative services for a term of up to one year. MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides IT services to IMS Health. The IT services are provided to IMS Health on terms that are comparable to unrelated third parties. The same is true for IT services provided to former affiliates of The Dun and Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation, former parents of the Company, and former and present affiliates of IMS Health. In 2002, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $20.4 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2001, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $18.8 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2000, the Company recognized related party revenues 42 totaling $14.3 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies (through August 30, 2000). DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT The Company and IMS Health entered into the Distribution Agreement, the terms of which have been approved by a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which was comprised of the Companys independent directors. The Distribution Agreement sets forth certain rights and obligations of IMS Health and the Company in respect of the exchange offer in addition to those provided in the Intercompany Agreement. For a more complete description of the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we urge you to read the entire Distribution Agreement, which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to Amendment No. 4 to Form S 4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on January 30, 2003. AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION Director Resignations. IMS Health caused David M. Thomas and Nancy E. Cooper to resign as of the consummation of the exchange offer from their positions as directors of the Company and from any boards of directors of the Companys subsidiaries on which they served. Indemnification. IMS Health and the Company have agreed to indemnification provisions in respect of the respective disclosure in the exchange offer documents, the conduct of the exchange offer and any failure to perform the Distribution Agreement. Joint and Several Undertakings. IMS Health requested, as a condition to the distribution of the Companys shares in the exchange offer, that the Company agree to undertake to be jointly and severally liable to certain of IMS Healths prior affiliates for liabilities arising out of or in connection with IMS Healths business and the businesses of the Company and other successors to the businesses of Cognizant Corporation in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement dated as of October 28, 1996, among Cognizant Corporation, which has been renamed Nielsen Media Research, Inc., The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which has been renamed the R.H. Donnelly Corporation and ACNielsen Corporation and related agreements. In addition, IMS Health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from the Company to Nielsen Media Research and Synavant Inc. with respect to liabilities allocated to IMS Health in connection with the Distribution Agreement, dated as of June 30, 1998, between Nielsen Media Research, Inc. and IMS Health and related agreements and the Distribution Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2000, between IMS Health and Synavant Inc. The Company has agreed to deliver these undertakings. However, subject to the general allocation of liabilities arising from the respective businesses of IMS Health and the Company, IMS Health has agreed to indemnify and reimburse the Company for liabilities incurred with respect to these undertakings. Commercial Arrangements. In addition to the Intercompany Services Agreement, IMS Health and the Company agreed to the continuation of certain commercial relationships between the companies for a period of at least three years. 43 Insurance. The Distribution Agreement includes provisions governing the administration of certain insurance programs and procedures for making claims and it also allocates the right to proceeds and the allocation of deductibles under these programs. Tax. The Distribution Agreement provides that IMS Health and the Company will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the exchange offer will be taxable to IMS Health if the exchange offer is part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50% or greater interest, based on either vote or value, in IMS Health or the Company. If IMS Health becomes subject to tax under Section 355(e) of the Code, its tax liability will be based upon the difference between the fair market value of the Cognizant Class B common stock at the time of the exchange offer and IMS Healths adjusted basis in the Cognizant Class B common stock at that time. This tax liability could be a material amount. If a breach by the Company of the representations made by it to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion or the covenants in the distribution agreement is the "but for" cause of the exchange offer either failing to qualify as a tax free distribution under Section 355(a) of the Code or becoming taxable to IMS Health under Section 355(e) of the Code, then the Company has agreed to indemnify IMS Health and each member of the consolidated group of which IMS Health is a member from and against any liability, including any taxes, interest or penalties or additions to tax, that is imposed upon IMS Health or any member of its consolidated group as a result of the exchange offer becoming taxable under Section 355 of the Code. The Company will be entitled to rely upon certain representations made by IMS Health to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion. In the event any of these representations are not true, correct or complete, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify IMS Health or the members of its consolidated group against any liability arising under Section 355 of the Code if the Companys breach of a representation would not have resulted in this type of liability had all of IMS Healths representations made in connection with McDermott, Will & Emerys tax opinion been true, complete and correct. As a result of the representations made to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion and the covenants in the Distribution Agreement, the acquisition of control of the Company during the two year period following the exchange offer may be more difficult or less likely to occur because of the potential indemnification liability associated with a breach of these representations or covenants. In addition, the Companys ability to undertake acquisitions and other transactions may be substantially restricted during the two year period following the exchange offer. OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS In December 2001, the Company paid IMS Health a one time fee of approximately $825,000 under an alliance agreement in which the Company was named "vendor of choice" for 44 IT services to the pharmaceutical industry. This agreement was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. In addition, the Company has a strategic business relationship with The TriZetto Group Inc. that includes helping its healthcare customers integrate TriZettos products with their existing information systems and, within TriZetto, supporting further development of these software applications. As of December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned approximately 26.4% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. During 2002 the Company recorded revenues from TriZetto of approximately $2.6 million and expenses related to TriZetto commissions and marketing fees of approximately $0.7 million. During 2001 the Company recorded revenues from TriZetto of approximately $401,000 and payments related to TriZetto commissions and marketing fees of approximately $1.0 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars; and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between the Indian subsidiary and the Companys U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. A portion of the Companys costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on the Companys results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Companys most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for its programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services offered by the Company have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, the Company must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on its fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that it charges for its services in the United States and elsewhere. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS During 2002 and 2001, various accounting pronouncements were issued which may impact the Companys financial statements. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 45 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, the Company or its representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of the Company. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. The Companys actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Companys future operating results include, but are not limited to the significant fluctuations of Cognizants quarterly operating results caused by a variety of factors, many of which are not within Cognizants control, including, but not limited to,: (i) the significant fluctuations of Cognizants quarterly operating results caused by a variety of factors, many of which are not within Cognizants control, including (a) the number, timing, scope and contractual terms of application design, development and maintenance projects, (b) delays in the performance of projects, (c) the accuracy of estimates of costs, resources and time to complete projects, (d) seasonal patterns of Cognizants services required by customers, (e) levels of market acceptance for Cognizants services, (f) potential adverse impacts of new tax legislation, and (g) the hiring of additional staff; (ii) changes in Cognizants billing and employee utilization rates; (iii) Cognizants ability to manage its growth effectively, which will require Cognizant (a) to increase the number of its personnel, particularly skilled technical, marketing and management personnel, (b) to find suitable acquisition candidates to support geographic expansion, and (c) to continue to develop and improve its operational, financial, communications and other internal systems, in the United States, India and Europe; (iv) Cognizants limited operating history with unaffiliated customers; (v) Cognizants reliance on key customers and large projects; (vi) the highly competitive nature of the markets for Cognizants services; (vii) Cognizants ability to successfully address the continuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer objectives and preferences; (viii) Cognizants reliance on the continued services of its key executive officers and leading technical personnel; (ix) Cognizants ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled employees in the future; (x) Cognizants ability to protect its intellectual property rights; (xi) the concentration of Cognizants operations in India and the related geo political risks of local and cross border conflicts; (xii) terrorist activity, the threat of terrorist activity, and responses to and results of terrorist activity and threats, including, but not limited to, effects, domestically and or internationally, on Cognizant, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, financial markets and general economic conditions; (xiii) the effects, domestically and or internationally, on Cognizant, its personnel and facilities, its customers and suppliers, financial markets and general economic conditions arising from hostilities involving the United States in Iraq or elsewhere; (xiv) a 46 breach of the Distribution agreement entered into between the Company and IMS Health; (xv) a change in the Companys intent to repatriate undistributed earnings and (xvi) general economic conditions. Such forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties; consequently, actual transactions and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied thereby. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company believes that it does not have operations subject to material risks of foreign currency fluctuations, nor does it use derivative financial instruments in its operations or investment portfolio. Nonetheless, the Company periodically evaluates the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that it is does not have exposure to material market risks associated with changes in interest rates, as they have no variable interest rate debt outstanding. The Company does not believe that it has any other material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates. 
 
Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GENERAL Cognizant is a leading provider of custom IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in the United States and Europe. Cognizants core competencies include web centric applications, data warehousing, component based development and legacy and client server systems. Cognizant provides the IT services it offers using an integrated on site/offshore business model. This seamless onsite/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located in India and Ireland. Cognizant began its IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, Cognizant, along with certain other entities, was spun off from the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, Cognizant completed its initial public offering. On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in Cognizant, and certain other entities were spun off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health Incorporated ("IMS Health"). Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated. At December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned 55.3% of the outstanding stock of Cognizant (representing all of Cognizants Class B common stock) and held 92.5% of the combined voting power of Cognizants common stock. Holders of Cognizants Class A common stock have one vote per share and holders of Cognizants Class B common stock have ten votes per share. On June 30, 2002, the Company acquired the assets of UHCI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. UHCI previously provided, and will continue to provide through CTS Ireland, application development and maintenance services, using the existing staff of approximately 70 software professionals. This acquisition is designed to enable the Company to provide a wide range of services to the Companys clients in Europe and worldwide and represents the initial implementation of the Companys previously announced international expansion strategy. Additionally, on October 29, 2002, the Company completed the transfer of Silverline Technologies, Inc.s practice, which serviced a major financial services company to the Company. Under the terms of the transfer, the Company will provide application design, development and maintenance services to such major financial services company through an acquired workforce of approximately three hundred IT and support professionals located primarily in the United States and India. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned (a total of 11,290,900 shares) in an exchange offer to its stockholders. IMS Health distributed 0.309 shares of Cognizant Class B common stock to its stockholders for every one share of IMS Healths common stock tendered. There was no impact on the number of Cognizants total shares of common stock outstanding as a result of the completion of the exchange offer. As a direct result of the IMS Health exchange offer Cognizant has incurred charges in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $1.7 million and expects total charges 28 aggregating approximately $3.5 million. Such charges primarily relate to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. In addition, total estimated charges include approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split off. As of February 21, 2003, pursuant to the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common stock converted into shares of Class A common stock. Accordingly, as of such date, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RISKS Financial Reporting Release No. 60 requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by the Company. In addition, Financial Reporting Release No. 61 requires all companies to include a discussion to address, among other things, liquidity, off balance sheet arrangements, contractual obligations and commercial commitments. The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserve for warranties, reserves for employee benefits, income taxes, depreciation of fixed assets and long lived assets, contingencies and litigation and the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. Most of the Companys IT development centers, including a substantial majority of its employees are located in India. As a result, the Company may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign 29 policy or the variability of foreign economic conditions. To date, the Company has not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate its risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Companys services are entered into on either a time and materials or fixed price basis. Revenues related to time and material contracts are recognized as the service is performed. Revenues related to fixed price contracts that provide for application development services or that provide for a combination of application development and application management services are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of performance is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Revenues related to fixed priced contracts that provided solely for application management services are recognized on a straight line basis or as services are rendered or transactions processed in accordance with contract terms. Expenses are recorded as incurred over the contract period. In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus in EITF 00 21 "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables". The consensus, which is effective for contracts entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, requires that a Company evaluate all deliverables in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. That evaluation must be performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each item in the arrangement is delivered. Arrangement consideration should be then allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. EITF 00 21 indicates that the best evidence of fair value is the price of a deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis. Fair value evidence often consists of entity specific or vendor specific objective evidence of fair value. The Company enters into contracts that could be considered arrangements with multiple deliverables. These contracts are primarily long term fixed bid contracts that provide both application maintenance and application development services. As indicated above and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company accounts for such contracts using percentage of completion accounting. The Company is currently evaluating the prospective impact of EITF 00 21 on the Companys results of operations related to contracts entered into after June 15, 2003. Fixed price contracts are cancelable subject to a specified notice period. All services provided by the Company through the date of cancellation are due and payable under the contract terms. The Company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based upon achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms. Differences between the timing of billings, based upon contract milestones or other contractual terms, and the recognition of revenue, based upon the percentage of completion method of accounting, are recognized as 30 either unbilled or deferred revenue. Estimates are subject to adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in expected completion costs. The cumulative impact of any revision in estimates is reflected in the financial reporting period in which the change in estimate becomes known and any anticipated losses on contracts are recognized immediately. A reserve for warranty provisions under such contracts, which generally exist for ninety days past contract completion, is estimated and accrued during the contract period. Revenues related to services performed without a signed agreement or work order are not recognized until there is evidence of an arrangement, such as when agreements or work orders are signed or payment is received; however the cost related to the performance of such work is recognized in the period the services are rendered. Such revenue is recognized when, and if, evidence of an arrangement is obtained. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from local currencies at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated from local currencies at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary ("CTS India"), the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between CTS India and its U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. The resulting gain (loss) is included in other income. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Cognizants Indian subsidiary, CTS India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to its export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of CTS India are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 90% exemption from Indian income tax. 31 These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and under current law will be completely phased out by March of 2009. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, Cognizant has provided deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24.9 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, Cognizant made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, Cognizant intends to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Bulletin 23, Cognizant will no longer accrue taxes on the repatriation of earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2002, the amount of unrepatriated earnings upon which no provision for taxation has been recorded is approximately $30.1 million. If such earnings are repatriated in the future, or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, Cognizant will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation. This change in intent, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India, resulted in an estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2002 of 23.4%. This rate compares to an effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2001 of 37.4%. Effective April 1, 2002, the government of India passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which the Companys earnings are taxed in India. The tax exemption for export earnings was reduced from 100% to 90%, a surtax was imposed increasing the effective rate from 35.7% to 36.75% for income that is subject to tax, and the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was replaced with a withholding tax on dividends. Cognizants cash requirements could change over time, which could effectively force it to change its intent on repatriating Indian earnings. If Cognizants earnings are intended to be repatriated in the future, or are no longer reinvested outside the United States, Cognizant will have to accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2002. These increased taxes could have a material adverse effect on Cognizants business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as cash flows to fund such taxes. In addition, Cognizant may need to accelerate the payment of significant deferred taxes, which would have a significant impact on its cash position. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES. Prior to 2002, goodwill, which related to the acquisition of the former minority interest in the Companys Indian subsidiary, was amortized using the straight line basis over a period of seven years. Effective January 1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("FAS 142"), the Company is no longer amortizing its remaining goodwill balance; however, at each balance date, the Company does evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. If such assets were determined to 32 be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on Cognizants business, results of operations and financial condition. LONG LIVED ASSETS. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets", which was adopted in 2002, the Company reviews for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, the Company will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue: 2000 2001 2002 Total revenues............................... 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of revenues............................. 51.4 51.1 53.6 Gross profit............................. 48.6 48.9 46.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses. 26.2 25.3 23.3 Depreciation and amortization expense........ 3.3 3.6 3.4 Income from operations................... 19.1 20.0 19.7 Other income (expense): Interest income.......................... 1.9 1.4 0.8 Split off costs..........................

Revenue increased by 28.9%, or approximately $51.3 million, from approximately $177.8 million during 2001 to approximately $229.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in application management and application development and integration services. The Company provides services through time and materials ("T&M") and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years revenues recognized under fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001 and 24.6% in 2002. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand for such services due to the customers ability to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were 10.6% in 2001 compared to 8.9% in 2002. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2002, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 35.1%, or approximately $31.9 million, from approximately $90.8 million during 2001 to approximately $122.7 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001 to over 6,100 employees at December 31, 2002. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services and on employees acquired through acquisitions. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Companys gross profit increased by 22.4%, or approximately $19.5 million, from approximately $86.9 million during 2001 to approximately $106.4 million during 2002. Gross profit margin decreased from 48.9% of revenues during 2001 to 46.4% of revenues in 2002. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to the significantly increased performance of the Company. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 19.2%, or approximately $9.9 million, from approximately $51.3 million during 2001 to approximately $61.2 million during 2002, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 28.9% to 26.7%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Companys expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. 34 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, from approximately $35.6 million during 2001 to approximately $45.2 million during 2002, representing approximately 20.0% and 19.7% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment, and in 2002, split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health has offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of the Companys Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income decreased by approximately 27.7%, from approximately $2.5 million during 2001 to approximately $1.8 million during 2002. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001 compared to an exchange loss of approximately $235,000 during 2002, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company recognized split off costs of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the exchange offer and expects total charges aggregating approximately $3.5 million in relation to one time costs associated with the exchange offer. Such charges primarily relate to direct and incremental legal, accounting, printing and other costs. In addition, total estimated charges include approximately $0.5 million of costs related to the retention and acceleration of Cognizant stock options by two former Directors of Cognizant who resigned on February 13, 2003 as a result of the split off. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $13.2 million in 2001 to approximately $10.5 million in 2002, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in 2001 and 23.4% in 2002. The lower effective tax rate reflects Cognizants change in its intention regarding the repatriation of 2002 and future earnings from its subsidiary in India, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $22.2 million in 2001 to approximately $34.6 million in 2002, representing approximately 12.5% and 15.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2002 primarily reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. 35 RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The Company, operating globally, provides software services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of software services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of software services principally in the United Kingdom. Asian operations consist of software services principally in India. The Company is managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by the Companys chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. In this regard, revenues are allocated to each geographic area based on the location of the customer. North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 31.4%, or approximately $47.7 million, from approximately $151.9 million during 2001 to approximately $199.6 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 29.4%, or approximately $8.9 million, from approximately $30.4 million during 2001 to approximately $39.4 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.1%, or approximately $3.7 million, from approximately $24.2 million during 2001 to approximately $27.9 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Companys services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 13.2%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.9 million during 2001 to approximately $5.5 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $1.6 million in each year. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $0.3 million in each year. 36 YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 29.7%, or approximately $40.7 million, from approximately $137.0 million during 2000 to approximately $177.8 million in 2001. This increase resulted primarily from approximately a $27.7 million (42.9%) increase in application management and approximately a $13.5 million (18.8%) increase in application development and integration, partially offset by an approximately $0.5 million (100.0%) decrease in Year 2000 compliance services. The Company provides services through T&M and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of revenues from 15.0% in 1999 to 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were relatively stable at 10.6% in 2001 compared to 10.4% in 2000. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was affiliated with the Company. During 2001 and 2000, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. The Companys cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. The Companys cost of revenues increased by 29.0%, or approximately $20.4 million, from approximately $70.4 million during 2000 to approximately $90.8 million in 2001. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of the Companys technical professionals from approximately 2,800 employees at December 31, 2000 to approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for the Companys services. The Companys gross profit increased by 30.5%, or approximately $20.3 million, from approximately $66.6 million during 2000 to approximately $86.9 during 2001. Gross profit margin increased from 48.6% of revenues during 2000 to 48.9% of revenues in 2001. The increase in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 26.8%, or approximately $10.8 million, from approximately $40.5 million during 2000 to approximately $51.3 million during 2001, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 29.5% to 28.9%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand the Companys sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support the Companys growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the increased revenues that have resulted from the Companys expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 36.3%, or approximately $9.5 million, from approximately $26.1 million during 2000 to approximately $35.6 million during 2001, representing approximately 19.1% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The 37 increase in operating margin was primarily due to a continued shift toward higher margin fixed bid contracts and a lower incentive compensation accrual in 2001 as compared to 2000. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment. Interest income decreased by approximately 5.6%, from approximately $2.6 million during 2000 to approximately $2.5 million during 2001. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. The Company recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on the Companys transactions. The Company recognized an impairment loss on its investment in Questra of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. (See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Historically, through the date of the IPO, the Company had been included in the consolidated federal income tax returns of The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation. The Companys provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income reflects the federal and state income taxes calculated on the Companys stand alone basis. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.6 million in 2000 to approximately $13.2 million in 2001, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in both years. The provision for income taxes reflects the Companys intent to repatriate earnings from its Indian subsidiary. NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $17.7 million in 2000 to approximately $22.2 million in 2001, representing approximately 12.9% and 12.5% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The lower percentage in 2001 reflects the one time write off of the Companys investment in Questra, discussed previously. RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 32.2%, or approximately $37.0 million, from approximately $114.9 million during 2000 to approximately $151.9 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore software delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for the Companys services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 38.9%, or approximately $8.5 million, from approximately $21.9 million during 2000 to approximately $30.4 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. 38 European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.6%, or approximately $3.3 million, from approximately $21.0 million during 2000 to approximately $24.2 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Companys sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for the Companys services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 21.7%, or approximately $0.9 million, from approximately $4.0 million during 2000 to approximately $4.9 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 42.5%, or approximately $0.5 million, from approximately $1.1 million during 2000 to approximately $1.6 million in 2001. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to the Companys success in India providing software services to domestic Indian companies as well as to Indian divisions of the Companys multi national clients. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 50.5%, or approximately $0.1 million, from approximately $0.2 million during 2000 to approximately $0.3 million during 2001. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2002, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million. The Company has used and plans to use such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including its offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines and possible acquisitions of related businesses, and formation of joint ventures; and (iii) general corporate purposes, including working capital. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $56.7 million, $32.1 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from increased net income, increased accrued employee incentive payments, which resulted in higher levels of year end accrued liabilities, increased tax benefits related to stock plans, offset, in part, by a greater increase in accounts receivable then the prior year. The increase in 2001 as compared to 2000 results primarily from increased levels of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, increased net income and an increase in deferred taxes, partially offset, by increases in accounts receivable and other current assets. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $20.5 million at December 31, 2000 to approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2001 and to approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $1.9 million at December 31, 2000 and to approximately $5.4 million at December 31, 2001 and decreased to approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2002 was due primarily to increased revenue. The decrease in unbilled accounts 39 receivable in 2002 compared to the prior year was primarily related to timing of fixed bid contractual billings. The Company monitors turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports which are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by the Companys finance staff. At December 31, 2002, the Companys days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 56 days as compared to 59 days and 50 days at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Companys investing activities used net cash of approximately $35.5 million, $14.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflects the Companys increased purchases of property and equipment to expand the Companys offshore development infrastructure and the acquisitions of intangible assets related to UHCI and Silverline Technologies, Inc. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The increase in 2001 of net cash used in investing activities as compared to 2000 primarily reflects an increase in purchases of property and equipment. In June 2000, the Company announced a strategic relationship with Trident Capital, a leading venture capital firm, to jointly invest in emerging e business service and technology companies. In accordance with this strategy, the Company invested approximately $2 million in Questra, an e business software and consulting firm headquartered in Rochester, New York, in return for an initial 5.8% equity interest. Trident Capital also independently made a direct investment in Questra. Based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which the Companys equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than the Company, received preferential liquidation rights, the Company recorded an impairment loss for the full $2.0 million original investment in recognition of an other than temporary impairment. The Companys investment is being accounted for under the cost basis of accounting. (See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) The Companys financing activities provided net cash of approximately $20 million, $6 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. The Company believes that its available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations, will be adequate to satisfy its current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. The Companys ability to expand and grow its business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet its long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which its cash flow increases, its ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, its continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, its ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, between the Company and IMS Health (the "Distribution Agreement"), especially as it relates to tax indemnities and the availability to the Company of public and private debt and equity financing. The Company cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to it, if at all. 40 At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $126 million and $85 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 the Company had no significant third party debt. The Company had working capital of approximately $134.3 and $95.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. The Company does not engage in hedging activities nor has it entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES As of December 31, 2002, the Company has entered into fixed capital commitments related to its India development center expansion program of approximately $28.8 million, of which approximately $19.2 million has been spent. The multi phase program will encompass the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 620,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Calcutta. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $35.6 million, which the Company expects to fund internally. The Company leases office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2011. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require the Company to pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002 are as follows: 2003................................................................$5,799 2004.................................................................3,829 2005.................................................................2,229 2006.................................................................1,755 2007.................................................................1,252 Thereafter...........................................................2,090 Total minimum lease payments.......................................$16,954 Cognizant is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on Cognizants quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of Cognizants engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of its customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against Cognizant, regardless of Cognizants responsibility for such failure. Although Cognizant attempts to contractually limit its liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering its application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect Cognizant from liability for damages. Although Cognizant has general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient 41 amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against Cognizant that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in Cognizants insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on Cognizants business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of the IMS Health split off, the Company has entered into certain agreements and indemnifications (See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES As indicated in Notes 1 and 9 and 13 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has entered into various agreements with IMS Health, who owned a majority and controlling interest in the outstanding common stock of the Company (55.3%) and held approximately 92.5% of the combined voting power of the Companys common stock at December 31, 2002. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health completed its plan to distribute all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in the exchange offer, which is the subject of Amendment No. 4 to Form S 4 Registration Statement filed by the Company on January 30, 2003. As of the completion of such distribution, IMS Health is no longer a related party of Cognizant. INTERCOMPANY SERVICES AGREEMENT Prior to the consummation of the exchange offer, pursuant to the terms of an Intercompany Services Agreement, dated as of May 15, 1998, IMS Health provided the Company with certain administrative services, including payroll and payables processing and permitted the Company to participate in IMS Healths business insurance plans. In prior periods, IMS Health provided certain other services such as tax planning and compliance, which have now been transitioned to the Company. Costs for all periods prior to the Companys IPO were allocated to the Company based on utilization of certain specific services. All subsequent services were performed and charged to the Company under the CTS/IMS Health intercompany services agreement that was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. IMS Health and Cognizant entered into an amended and restated Intercompany Services Agreement, effective following the consummation of the exchange offer, which provides for the continued provision of payroll, payables processing and certain other administrative services for a term of up to one year. MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT The Company and IMS Health have entered into Master Services Agreements pursuant to which the Company provides IT services to IMS Health. The IT services are provided to IMS Health on terms that are comparable to unrelated third parties. The same is true for IT services provided to former affiliates of The Dun and Bradstreet Corporation and Cognizant Corporation, former parents of the Company, and former and present affiliates of IMS Health. In 2002, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $20.4 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2001, the Company recognized related party revenues totaling $18.8 million for services performed for IMS Health. In 2000, the Company recognized related party revenues 42 totaling $14.3 million including revenues from IMS Health and Strategic Technologies (through August 30, 2000). DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT The Company and IMS Health entered into the Distribution Agreement, the terms of which have been approved by a special committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, which was comprised of the Companys independent directors. The Distribution Agreement sets forth certain rights and obligations of IMS Health and the Company in respect of the exchange offer in addition to those provided in the Intercompany Agreement. For a more complete description of the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we urge you to read the entire Distribution Agreement, which has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to Amendment No. 4 to Form S 4 Registration Statement filed with the SEC on January 30, 2003. AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION Director Resignations. IMS Health caused David M. Thomas and Nancy E. Cooper to resign as of the consummation of the exchange offer from their positions as directors of the Company and from any boards of directors of the Companys subsidiaries on which they served. Indemnification. IMS Health and the Company have agreed to indemnification provisions in respect of the respective disclosure in the exchange offer documents, the conduct of the exchange offer and any failure to perform the Distribution Agreement. Joint and Several Undertakings. IMS Health requested, as a condition to the distribution of the Companys shares in the exchange offer, that the Company agree to undertake to be jointly and severally liable to certain of IMS Healths prior affiliates for liabilities arising out of or in connection with IMS Healths business and the businesses of the Company and other successors to the businesses of Cognizant Corporation in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement dated as of October 28, 1996, among Cognizant Corporation, which has been renamed Nielsen Media Research, Inc., The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, which has been renamed the R.H. Donnelly Corporation and ACNielsen Corporation and related agreements. In addition, IMS Health is obligated to procure similar undertakings from the Company to Nielsen Media Research and Synavant Inc. with respect to liabilities allocated to IMS Health in connection with the Distribution Agreement, dated as of June 30, 1998, between Nielsen Media Research, Inc. and IMS Health and related agreements and the Distribution Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2000, between IMS Health and Synavant Inc. The Company has agreed to deliver these undertakings. However, subject to the general allocation of liabilities arising from the respective businesses of IMS Health and the Company, IMS Health has agreed to indemnify and reimburse the Company for liabilities incurred with respect to these undertakings. Commercial Arrangements. In addition to the Intercompany Services Agreement, IMS Health and the Company agreed to the continuation of certain commercial relationships between the companies for a period of at least three years. 43 Insurance. The Distribution Agreement includes provisions governing the administration of certain insurance programs and procedures for making claims and it also allocates the right to proceeds and the allocation of deductibles under these programs. Tax. The Distribution Agreement provides that IMS Health and the Company will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the exchange offer will be taxable to IMS Health if the exchange offer is part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50% or greater interest, based on either vote or value, in IMS Health or the Company. If IMS Health becomes subject to tax under Section 355(e) of the Code, its tax liability will be based upon the difference between the fair market value of the Cognizant Class B common stock at the time of the exchange offer and IMS Healths adjusted basis in the Cognizant Class B common stock at that time. This tax liability could be a material amount. If a breach by the Company of the representations made by it to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion or the covenants in the distribution agreement is the "but for" cause of the exchange offer either failing to qualify as a tax free distribution under Section 355(a) of the Code or becoming taxable to IMS Health under Section 355(e) of the Code, then the Company has agreed to indemnify IMS Health and each member of the consolidated group of which IMS Health is a member from and against any liability, including any taxes, interest or penalties or additions to tax, that is imposed upon IMS Health or any member of its consolidated group as a result of the exchange offer becoming taxable under Section 355 of the Code. The Company will be entitled to rely upon certain representations made by IMS Health to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion. In the event any of these representations are not true, correct or complete, the Company will not be obligated to indemnify IMS Health or the members of its consolidated group against any liability arising under Section 355 of the Code if the Companys breach of a representation would not have resulted in this type of liability had all of IMS Healths representations made in connection with McDermott, Will & Emerys tax opinion been true, complete and correct. As a result of the representations made to McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with its tax opinion and the covenants in the Distribution Agreement, the acquisition of control of the Company during the two year period following the exchange offer may be more difficult or less likely to occur because of the potential indemnification liability associated with a breach of these representations or covenants. In addition, the Companys ability to undertake acquisitions and other transactions may be substantially restricted during the two year period following the exchange offer. OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS In December 2001, the Company paid IMS Health a one time fee of approximately $825,000 under an alliance agreement in which the Company was named "vendor of choice" for 44 IT services to the pharmaceutical industry. This agreement was negotiated between the parties on an arms length basis. In addition, the Company has a strategic business relationship with The TriZetto Group Inc. that includes helping its healthcare customers integrate TriZettos products with their existing information systems and, within TriZetto, supporting further development of these software applications. As of December 31, 2002, IMS Health owned approximately 26.4% of the outstanding common stock of Trizetto. During 2002 the Company recorded revenues from TriZetto of approximately $2.6 million and expenses related to TriZetto commissions and marketing fees of approximately $0.7 million. During 2001 the Company recorded revenues from TriZetto of approximately $401,000 and payments related to TriZetto commissions and marketing fees of approximately $1.0 million. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian and European subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity. For the Companys Indian subsidiary, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar since its sales are made primarily in the United States, the sales price is predominantly in U.S. dollars; and there is a high volume of intercompany transactions denominated in U.S. dollars between the Indian subsidiary and the Companys U.S. affiliates. Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. A portion of the Companys costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on the Companys results of operations. EFFECTS OF INFLATION The Companys most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for its programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services offered by the Company have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, the Company must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on its fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that it charges for its services in the United States and elsewhere. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS During 2002 and 2001, various accounting pronouncements were issued which may impact the Companys financial statements. (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 45 FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties.

Such forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties; consequently, actual transactions and results may differ materially from those expressed or implied thereby. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company believes that it does not have operations subject to material risks of foreign currency fluctuations, nor does it use derivative financial instruments in its operations or investment portfolio. Nonetheless, the Company periodically evaluates the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company believes that it is does not have exposure to material market risks associated with changes in interest rates, as they have no variable interest rate debt outstanding. The Company does not believe that it has any other material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates.
