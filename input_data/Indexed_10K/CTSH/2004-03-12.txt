MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a leading provider of custom IT services related to IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in the United States and Europe. Our core competencies include web centric applications, data warehousing, component based development and legacy and client server systems. We provide IT services using an integrated on site/offshore business model. This seamless on site/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located in India and Ireland. In 2003, our revenue increased to $368.2 million compared to $229.1 million in 2002. Net income increased to $57.4 million or $0.84 per diluted share in 2003 compared to $34.6 million or $0.54 per diluted share in 2002. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our application management and application development and integration services. We believe this trend will continue in 2004. We finished 2003 with 153 active clients compared to 115 in 2002. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2004 will come from increased penetration of existing clients. During 2003, 88% of our revenue came from clients in North America. In 2004, we will look to expand our presence in Northern Europe as we are starting to see an increased level of interest for offshore services in that region. In 2003, our operating margin decreased approximately 10 basis points to 19.6% from 19.7% in 2002. This was consistent with our targeted operating margin range of 19 to 20% of total revenues. At December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of $194.2 million, an increase of $68 million over the prior year. On December 22, 2003, we announced building plans for three additional fully owned development centers containing over 600,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Bangalore. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $42.5 million, which we expect to fund from current operations. Accordingly, we believe our financial condition will remain strong. In addition, we will continue to consider acquisitions of companies that can improve our capabilities in certain market niches or geographic areas. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We 38 base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. 39 Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to Cognizant Indias export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and, under current law, will be completely phased out by March of 2009. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $28.6 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, we intend to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental U.S. taxes on all foreign earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $79.5 million. While we have no plans to do so, if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2003. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to 2002 will require adjustment. Effective April 1, 2003, the government of India passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which our earnings are taxed in India. The tax exemption for export earnings was restored to 100% from 90%. The surtax was reduced, decreasing the Indian effective rate from 36.75% to 35.875% for income that is subject to tax, the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was restored and the withholding tax on dividends was repealed. GOODWILL. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2003, our goodwill balance was approximately $4.5 million. LONG LIVED ASSETS. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets", which was adopted in 2002, we review for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 40 RISKS. Most of our IT development centers, including a substantial majority of our employees are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. See Item 1 "Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results" for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results.

Revenue increased by 60.7%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately $229.1 million during 2002 to approximately $368.2 million in 2003. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in both application management and development services, and revenue generated from acquisitions. We provide services through time and materials and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years, revenues recognized under fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 23.9% in 2001 to 24.6% in 2002 and 25.9% in 2003. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand 41 due to our customers preferring to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. During 2003, one customer, JP Morgan Chase, accounted for 10.1% of our revenues and, in 2002, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 62.8%, or approximately $77.0 million, from approximately $122.7 million during 2002 to approximately $199.7 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals from approximately 5,600 employees at December 31, 2002 to approximately 8,500 employees at December 31, 2003. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $62.1 million, from approximately $106.4 million during 2002 to approximately $168.5 million during 2003. Gross profit margin decreased from 46.4% of revenues during 2002 to 45.8% of revenues in 2003. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 57.2%, or approximately $35.0 million, from approximately $61.2 million during 2002 to approximately $96.2 million during 2003, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.7% to 26.1%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 60.0%, or approximately $27.1 million, from approximately $45.2 million during 2002 to approximately $72.3 million during 2003, representing approximately 19.7% and 19.6% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the lower gross margin partially offset by our ability to leverage prior sales and marketing investments. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income and split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income increased by approximately 17.7%, from approximately $1.8 million during 2002 to approximately $2.1 million during 2003. The increase in such interest income was attributable to higher invested cash balances partially offset by lower global interest rates. We recognized split off costs of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. 42 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.5 million in 2002 to approximately $14.9 million in 2003, with an effective tax rate of 23.4% in 2002 and 20.6% in 2003. The lower effective tax rate is a result of a reduction in the surtax in India and the restoration of the 100% exemption on export earnings both of which were effective April 1, 2003. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $34.6 million in 2002 to approximately $57.4 million in 2003, representing approximately 15.1% and 15.6% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2003 is primarily attributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 28.9%, or approximately $51.3 million, from approximately $177.8 million during 2001 to approximately $229.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in application management and application development and integration services. We provide services through time and materials and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years revenues recognized under fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001 to 24.6% in 2002. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were 8.9% in 2002 compared to 10.6% in 2001. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was our affiliate. During 2002 and 2001, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 35.1%, or approximately $31.9 million, from approximately $90.8 million during 2001 to approximately $122.7 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals from approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001 to approximately 5,600 employees at December 31, 2002. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit increased by 22.4%, or approximately $19.5 million, from approximately $86.9 million during 2001 to approximately $106.4 million during 2002. Gross profit margin decreased from 48.9% of revenues during 2001 to 46.4% of revenues in 2002. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to our significantly increased performance. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 19.2%, or approximately $9.9 million, from approximately $51.3 million during 2001 to approximately $61.2 million during 2002, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 28.9% to 26.7%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses 43 incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, from approximately $35.6 million during 2001 to approximately $45.2 million during 2002, representing approximately 20.0% and 19.7% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment, and in 2002, split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health has offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. (See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.) Interest income decreased by approximately 27.7%, from approximately $2.5 million during 2001 to approximately $1.8 million during 2002. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. We recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001 compared to an exchange loss of approximately $235,000 during 2002, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on our transactions. We recognized an impairment loss on our investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which our equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than us, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. We recognized split off costs of approximately $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the exchange offer. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $13.2 million in 2001 to approximately $10.5 million in 2002, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in 2001 and 23.4% in 2002. The lower effective tax rate reflects our change in our intention regarding the repatriation of 2002 and future earnings from our subsidiary in India, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $22.2 million in 2001 to approximately $34.6 million in 2002, representing approximately 12.5% and 15.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2002 primarily reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. Results by Business Segment We, operating globally, provide IT services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of IT services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of IT services principally in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands and 44 Ireland. Asian operations consist of IT services principally in India, Singapore, Japan and Australia. We are managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by our chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. In this regard, revenues are allocated to each geographic area based on the location of the customer. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, operating results by geographic segment: 2002 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Increase Increase 2001 2002 2003 (Decrease) % (Decrease) % Revenues North America ................... $151,933 $199,605 $325,337 $ 47,672 31.4% $125,732 63.0% Europe .......................... 24,221 27,886 40,160 3,665 15.1 12,274 44.0 Asia ............................ 1,624 1,595 2,734 (29) (1.8) 1,139 71.4 Total revenue .................. $177,778 $229,086 $368,231 Operating Income North America ................... $ 30,435 $ 39,380 $ 63,888 $ 8,945 29.4% $ 24,508 62.2% Europe .......................... 4,860 5,503 7,887 643 13.2 2,384 43.3 Asia ............................ 325 315 537 (10) (3.1) 222 70.5 Total revenue .................. $ 35,620 $ 45,198 $ 72,312 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 North American Segment REVENUE.

Revenue increased by 15.1%, or approximately $3.7 million, from approximately $24.2 million during 2001 to approximately $27.9 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable to our sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for our services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 13.2%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.9 million during 2001 to approximately $5.5 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $1.6 million in each year. 46 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $0.3 million in each year. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $194.2 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had no significant third party debt. We had working capital of approximately $215.9 and $134.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $79.9 million, $56.7 million and $32.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2001 to approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002 and to approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003. Unbilled accounts receivable decreased from approximately $5.4 million at December 31, 2001 to approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002 and increased to approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2003 was due primarily to increased revenue. The increase in unbilled accounts receivable in 2003 compared to the prior year was due primarily to revenue growth and increased percentage of revenue coming from fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2003, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 53 days as compared to 56 days and 59 days at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $37.8 million, $35.5 million and $15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily reflects our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure offset in part by lower spending for acquisitions in 2003. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflects our increased purchases of property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure and the acquisitions of intangible assets related to UnitedHealthcare Ireland Limited and Silverline Technologies, Inc. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.) Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $21.8 million, $20.0 million, and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock, partially offset by payment of split off costs in 2003. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least 47 the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We do not engage in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2003, we have substantially completed the initial phase of our Indian development center expansion program, which was announced in July 2001. The program encompassed the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 650,000 square feet of space in Chennai, Pune and Calcutta. On December 22, 2003, we announced building plans for three additional fully owned development centers containing over 600,000 square feet of space in Chennai, Pune and Bangalore. As of December 31, 2003, we had entered into fixed capital commitments related to this program of approximately $0.3 million, of which approximately $0.3 million had been spent. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $42.5 million, which we expect to fund internally. We lease office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2032. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require that we pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2003 are as follows (in thousands): 2004........................... $ 5,573 2005........................... 4,484 2006........................... 2,229 2007........................... 1,296 2008........................... 1,126 Thereafter..................... 996 Total minimum lease payments... $ 15,704 We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating 48 results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Distribution Agreement with IMS Health provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation A portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on our results of operations. Related Party Transactions As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 13, 2003 (the "Split Off Date"), IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the "Split Off"). As a result of the Split Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million, $20.4 million and $18.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million. In 2004, we do not expect significant change from prior periods in revenues earned for services provided to IMS Health. 49 Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During 2003 and 2002, various accounting pronouncements were issued which may impact our financial statements. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled "Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results." ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We believe that we do not have operations subject to material risks of foreign currency fluctuations, nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio. Nonetheless, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. We believe that we do not have exposure to material market risks associated with changes in interest rates, as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding. We do not believe that we have any other material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates. 50 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a leading provider of custom IT services related to IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in the United States and Europe. Our core competencies include web centric applications, data warehousing, component based development and legacy and client server systems. We provide IT services using an integrated on site/offshore business model. This seamless on site/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located in India and Ireland. In 2003, our revenue increased to $368.2 million compared to $229.1 million in 2002. Net income increased to $57.4 million or $0.84 per diluted share in 2003 compared to $34.6 million or $0.54 per diluted share in 2002. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our application management and application development and integration services. We believe this trend will continue in 2004. We finished 2003 with 153 active clients compared to 115 in 2002. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2004 will come from increased penetration of existing clients. During 2003, 88% of our revenue came from clients in North America. In 2004, we will look to expand our presence in Northern Europe as we are starting to see an increased level of interest for offshore services in that region. In 2003, our operating margin decreased approximately 10 basis points to 19.6% from 19.7% in 2002. This was consistent with our targeted operating margin range of 19 to 20% of total revenues. At December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of $194.2 million, an increase of $68 million over the prior year. On December 22, 2003, we announced building plans for three additional fully owned development centers containing over 600,000 square feet of space in Pune, Chennai and Bangalore. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $42.5 million, which we expect to fund from current operations. Accordingly, we believe our financial condition will remain strong. In addition, we will continue to consider acquisitions of companies that can improve our capabilities in certain market niches or geographic areas. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We 38 base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost. Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer based upon market capitalization and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. INCOME TAXES. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. 39 Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten years with respect to Cognizant Indias export profits. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits and are therefore currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. These tax holidays will begin to expire in 2004 and, under current law, will be completely phased out by March of 2009. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $28.6 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, we intend to use 2002 and future Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental U.S. taxes on all foreign earnings recognized in 2002 and subsequent periods as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2003, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $79.5 million. While we have no plans to do so, if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a substantially higher rate than the effective rate in 2003. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to 2002 will require adjustment. Effective April 1, 2003, the government of India passed various tax law changes which affected the way in which our earnings are taxed in India. The tax exemption for export earnings was restored to 100% from 90%. The surtax was reduced, decreasing the Indian effective rate from 36.75% to 35.875% for income that is subject to tax, the corporate level tax on the payment of dividends was restored and the withholding tax on dividends was repealed. GOODWILL. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2003, our goodwill balance was approximately $4.5 million. LONG LIVED ASSETS. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets", which was adopted in 2002, we review for impairment long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 40 RISKS. Most of our IT development centers, including a substantial majority of our employees are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging transactions to mitigate our risks relating to exchange rate fluctuations. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. See Item 1 "Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results" for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results.

Revenue increased by 60.7%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately $229.1 million during 2002 to approximately $368.2 million in 2003. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in both application management and development services, and revenue generated from acquisitions. We provide services through time and materials and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years, revenues recognized under fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 23.9% in 2001 to 24.6% in 2002 and 25.9% in 2003. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand 41 due to our customers preferring to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. During 2003, one customer, JP Morgan Chase, accounted for 10.1% of our revenues and, in 2002, no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 62.8%, or approximately $77.0 million, from approximately $122.7 million during 2002 to approximately $199.7 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals from approximately 5,600 employees at December 31, 2002 to approximately 8,500 employees at December 31, 2003. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $62.1 million, from approximately $106.4 million during 2002 to approximately $168.5 million during 2003. Gross profit margin decreased from 46.4% of revenues during 2002 to 45.8% of revenues in 2003. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 57.2%, or approximately $35.0 million, from approximately $61.2 million during 2002 to approximately $96.2 million during 2003, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.7% to 26.1%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 60.0%, or approximately $27.1 million, from approximately $45.2 million during 2002 to approximately $72.3 million during 2003, representing approximately 19.7% and 19.6% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the lower gross margin partially offset by our ability to leverage prior sales and marketing investments. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income and split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income increased by approximately 17.7%, from approximately $1.8 million during 2002 to approximately $2.1 million during 2003. The increase in such interest income was attributable to higher invested cash balances partially offset by lower global interest rates. We recognized split off costs of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. 42 PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.5 million in 2002 to approximately $14.9 million in 2003, with an effective tax rate of 23.4% in 2002 and 20.6% in 2003. The lower effective tax rate is a result of a reduction in the surtax in India and the restoration of the 100% exemption on export earnings both of which were effective April 1, 2003. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $34.6 million in 2002 to approximately $57.4 million in 2003, representing approximately 15.1% and 15.6% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2003 is primarily attributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 REVENUE. Revenue increased by 28.9%, or approximately $51.3 million, from approximately $177.8 million during 2001 to approximately $229.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in application management and application development and integration services. We provide services through time and materials and fixed bid contracts. Over the course of the last three years revenues recognized under fixed bid contracts have increased as a percent of total revenues from 15.1% in 2000 to 23.9% in 2001 to 24.6% in 2002. Sales to related parties on a year over year basis were 8.9% in 2002 compared to 10.6% in 2001. For statement of operations purposes, revenues from related parties only include revenues recognized during the period in which the related party was our affiliate. During 2002 and 2001, no third party accounted for greater than 10% of revenues. GROSS PROFIT. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 35.1%, or approximately $31.9 million, from approximately $90.8 million during 2001 to approximately $122.7 million in 2002. The increase was due primarily to the increased cost resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals from approximately 3,470 employees at December 31, 2001 to approximately 5,600 employees at December 31, 2002. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit increased by 22.4%, or approximately $19.5 million, from approximately $86.9 million during 2001 to approximately $106.4 million during 2002. Gross profit margin decreased from 48.9% of revenues during 2001 to 46.4% of revenues in 2002. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001, due to our significantly increased performance. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 19.2%, or approximately $9.9 million, from approximately $51.3 million during 2001 to approximately $61.2 million during 2002, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 28.9% to 26.7%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses 43 incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 26.9%, or approximately $9.6 million, from approximately $35.6 million during 2001 to approximately $45.2 million during 2002, representing approximately 20.0% and 19.7% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs in 2002 as compared to 2001. OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE. Other income/expense consists primarily of interest income offset, by foreign currency exchange losses and, in 2001, an impairment loss on an investment, and in 2002, split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health has offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. (See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.) Interest income decreased by approximately 27.7%, from approximately $2.5 million during 2001 to approximately $1.8 million during 2002. The decrease in such interest income was attributable primarily to lower interest rates, offset, in part, by higher operating cash balances. We recognized a net foreign currency exchange loss of approximately $767,000 during 2001 compared to an exchange loss of approximately $235,000 during 2002, as a result of the effect of changing exchange rates on our transactions. We recognized an impairment loss on our investment in Questra Corporation ("Questra") of approximately $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2001 in recognition of an other than temporary decline in value. The impairment loss was based upon an implied valuation of Questra as a result of a recent new round of venture capital funding in which our equity interest in Questra was substantially diluted and investors, other than us, received preferential liquidation rights. The impairment loss, net of tax benefit, was approximately $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. We recognized split off costs of approximately $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to the exchange offer. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $13.2 million in 2001 to approximately $10.5 million in 2002, with an effective tax rate of 37.4% in 2001 and 23.4% in 2002. The lower effective tax rate reflects our change in our intention regarding the repatriation of 2002 and future earnings from our subsidiary in India, as well as a change in the manner in which repatriated earnings are taxed in India. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.) NET INCOME. Net income increased from approximately $22.2 million in 2001 to approximately $34.6 million in 2002, representing approximately 12.5% and 15.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2002 primarily reflects the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. Results by Business Segment We, operating globally, provide IT services for medium and large businesses. North American operations consist primarily of IT services in the United States and Canada. European operations consist of IT services principally in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands and 44 Ireland. Asian operations consist of IT services principally in India, Singapore, Japan and Australia. We are managed on a geographic basis. Accordingly, regional sales managers, sales managers, account managers, project teams and facilities are segmented geographically and decisions by our chief operating decision maker regarding the allocation of assets and assessment of performance are based on such geographic segmentation. In this regard, revenues are allocated to each geographic area based on the location of the customer. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, operating results by geographic segment: 2002 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Increase Increase 2001 2002 2003 (Decrease) % (Decrease) % Revenues North America ................... $151,933 $199,605 $325,337 $ 47,672 31.4% $125,732 63.0% Europe .......................... 24,221 27,886 40,160 3,665 15.1 12,274 44.0 Asia ............................ 1,624 1,595 2,734 (29) (1.8) 1,139 71.4 Total revenue .................. $177,778 $229,086 $368,231 Operating Income North America ................... $ 30,435 $ 39,380 $ 63,888 $ 8,945 29.4% $ 24,508 62.2% Europe .......................... 4,860 5,503 7,887 643 13.2 2,384 43.3 Asia ............................ 325 315 537 (10) (3.1) 222 70.5 Total revenue .................. $ 35,620 $ 45,198 $ 72,312 Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 63.0%, or approximately $125.7 million, from approximately $199.6 million during 2002 to approximately $325.3 million in 2003. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model as a means of reducing a customers internal IT costs, as well as increased sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for our services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 62.2%, or approximately $24.5 million, from approximately $39.4 million during 2002 to approximately $63.9 million during 2003. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 44.0%, or approximately $12.3 million, from approximately $27.9 million during 2002 to approximately $40.2 million in 2003. The increase in revenue was attributable to the increased acceptance of our services, particularly in the United Kingdom. 45 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 43.3%, or approximately $2.4 million, from approximately $5.5 million during 2002 to approximately $7.9 million during 2003. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 71.4%, or approximately $1.1 million, from approximately $1.6 million during 2002 to approximately $2.7 million in 2003. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increased acceptance of our on site/offshore delivery model by clients based in Japan, Singapore and Australia. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 70.5%, or approximately $0.2 million, from approximately $0.3 million during 2002 to approximately $0.5 million during 2003. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001 North American Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 31.4%, or approximately $47.7 million, from approximately $151.9 million during 2001 to approximately $199.6 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to increased market awareness and acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for our services. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 29.4%, or approximately $8.9 million, from approximately $30.4 million during 2001 to approximately $39.4 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. European Segment REVENUE. Revenue increased by 15.1%, or approximately $3.7 million, from approximately $24.2 million during 2001 to approximately $27.9 million in 2002. The increase in revenue was attributable to our sales and marketing activities in the United Kingdom, partially offset by weak demand for our services elsewhere in Europe. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations increased 13.2%, or approximately $0.6 million, from approximately $4.9 million during 2001 to approximately $5.5 million during 2002. The increase in operating income was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Asian Segment REVENUE. Revenue was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $1.6 million in each year. 46 INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. Income from operations was essentially constant from 2001 to 2002 at approximately $0.3 million in each year. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $194.2 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had no significant third party debt. We had working capital of approximately $215.9 and $134.3 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $79.9 million, $56.7 million and $32.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $22.5 million at December 31, 2001 to approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002 and to approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003. Unbilled accounts receivable decreased from approximately $5.4 million at December 31, 2001 to approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002 and increased to approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2003 was due primarily to increased revenue. The increase in unbilled accounts receivable in 2003 compared to the prior year was due primarily to revenue growth and increased percentage of revenue coming from fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2003, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 53 days as compared to 56 days and 59 days at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $37.8 million, $35.5 million and $15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily reflects our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure offset in part by lower spending for acquisitions in 2003. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily reflects our increased purchases of property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure and the acquisitions of intangible assets related to UnitedHealthcare Ireland Limited and Silverline Technologies, Inc. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.) Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $21.8 million, $20.0 million, and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock, partially offset by payment of split off costs in 2003. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least 47 the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We do not engage in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2003, we have substantially completed the initial phase of our Indian development center expansion program, which was announced in July 2001. The program encompassed the construction of three fully owned development centers containing approximately 650,000 square feet of space in Chennai, Pune and Calcutta. On December 22, 2003, we announced building plans for three additional fully owned development centers containing over 600,000 square feet of space in Chennai, Pune and Bangalore. As of December 31, 2003, we had entered into fixed capital commitments related to this program of approximately $0.3 million, of which approximately $0.3 million had been spent. Total costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $42.5 million, which we expect to fund internally. We lease office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2032. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require that we pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2003 are as follows (in thousands): 2004........................... $ 5,573 2005........................... 4,484 2006........................... 2,229 2007........................... 1,296 2008........................... 1,126 Thereafter..................... 996 Total minimum lease payments... $ 15,704 We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating 48 results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The Distribution Agreement with IMS Health provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation A portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has not had any material effect on our results of operations. Related Party Transactions As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 13, 2003 (the "Split Off Date"), IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the "Split Off"). As a result of the Split Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million, $20.4 million and $18.8 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million. In 2004, we do not expect significant change from prior periods in revenues earned for services provided to IMS Health. 49 Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Recent Accounting Pronouncements During 2003 and 2002, various accounting pronouncements were issued which may impact our financial statements. (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.) Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should" or "anticipates" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled "Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results." ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We believe that we do not have operations subject to material risks of foreign currency fluctuations, nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio. Nonetheless, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. We believe that we do not have exposure to material market risks associated with changes in interest rates, as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding. We do not believe that we have any other material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates. 50
