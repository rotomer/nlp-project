Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Overview We are a leading provider of custom IT services related to IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in North America and Europe. Our core competencies include web centric applications, data warehousing, component based development and legacy and client server systems. We provide IT services using an integrated on site/offshore business model. This seamless on site/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in India. In 2004, our revenue increased to $586.7 million compared to $368.2 million in 2003. Net income increased to $100.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2004 compared to $57.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share in 2003. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our application management and application development and integration services. We finished 2004 with 233 active clients compared to 153 in 2003. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2005 will come from increased penetration of existing clients. During 2004, 87% of our revenue came from clients in North America. In 2005, we will look to expand our presence in Northern Europe as we are starting to see an increased level of interest for offshore services in that region. In 2004, our operating margin increased to approximately 20.0% compared to 19.6% in 2003. This was consistent with our targeted operating margin range of 19 to 20% of total revenues. At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of $314.8 million, an increase of approximately $121 million compared to December 31, 2003. Our most recent building plans provide for construction of over 900,000 square feet of space in new fully owned development and training centers located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, India. This supersedes our previous plans, announced in December 2003, which included 600,000 square feet of new space. Total construction costs related to this program are currently estimated to be approximately $76.0 million, which we expect to fund primarily from current operations. We believe our financial condition will remain strong. In addition, we will continue to consider acquisitions of companies that can improve our capabilities in certain market niches or geographic areas. On June 29, 2004, we announced our plans to wind down operations at our development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March 31, 2005. We decided to close this facility due to the increased cost structure resulting from the significant appreciation in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar since the facility was acquired in 2002. The work performed in this facility is being transferred to Cognizants operations in North America and India. Currently, we expect to incur through 2005 aggregate incremental costs of approximately $1.6 million associated with the closure of this facility. In 2004, we have recorded expenses of approximately $1.5 million primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of approximately $1.0 million through December 31, 2004. Approximately 50 employees are affected by the closure. 35 Table of Contents On April 12, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a conditional two for one stock split to be effected by a 100% stock dividend payable on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2004. The stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on May 26, 2004 and, as a result, the stock dividend was paid on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Stockholders equity accounts have been restated to reflect a reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of Class A common stock from the additional paid in capital account to the Class A common stock account. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting, for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of 36 Table of Contents each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten year tax holiday expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to Indian income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. The tax holiday will not be expiring for any STPs in 2005. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24.1 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental U.S. taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $155.9 million. While we have no plans to do so, if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate 37 Table of Contents substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2004. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to 2002 will require adjustment. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act) was enacted into law. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and as of today, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. As such, we are not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Under the provisions of the Act and subject to the completion of our analysis of the Act and the operating results of our controlled foreign entities during 2005, we will be eligible to repatriate some amount between $0 and $500 million. Due to the complexities of domestic and foreign tax law and the lack of clarity surrounding the Act, we cannot reasonably estimate the tax liability if we elect to repatriate any accumulated foreign earnings. We expect to finalize our assessment in 2005 after further guidance is published . The funds may only be repatriated in 2005. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2004, our goodwill balance was approximately $9.7 million. Long lived Assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review for impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance 38 Table of Contents with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1 Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2004: (Dollars in thousands) % of % of % of Increase 2004 Revenues 2003 Revenues 2002 Revenues 2004 2003 Revenues $ 586,673 100.0 % $ 368,231 100.0 % $ 229,086 100.0 % $ 218,442 $ 139,145 Cost of revenues 319,810 54.5 199,724 54.2 122,701 53.6 120,086 77,023 Gross profit 266,863 45.5 168,507 45.8 106,385 46.4 98,356 62,122 Selling, general and administrative 132,796 22.7 84,259 22.9 53,345 23.3 48,537 30,914 Depreciation and amortization 16,447 2.8 11,936 3.3 7,842 3.4 4,511 4,094 Income from operations 117,620 20.0 72,312 19.6 45,198 19.7 45,308 27,114 Other income (expense), net 4,475 (81 ) (107 ) 4,556 26 Provision for income taxes (21,852 ) (14,866 ) (10,529 ) 6,986 4,337 Net income $ 100,243 17.1 $ 57,365 15.6 $ 34,562 15.1 42,878 22,803 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenue. Revenue increased by 59.3%, or approximately $218.4 million, from approximately $368.2 million during 2003 to approximately $586.7 million in 2004. This increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2003, including acquisitions. Specifically, our financial services segment accounted for approximately $120 million of the year over year increase. Demand for application development and integration services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers discretionary spending. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% and 10.1% of our revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. No other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2004 or 2003. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60.1%, or approximately $120.1 million, from approximately $199.7 million during 2003 to approximately $319.8 million in 2004. The 39 Table of Contents increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $98.4 million, from approximately $168.5 million during 2003 to approximately $266.9 million during 2004. Gross profit margin decreased from 45.8% of revenues during 2003 to 45.5% of revenues in 2004. The decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable, in part, to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or approximately $53.0 million, from approximately $96.2 million during 2003 to approximately $149.2 million during 2004, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.1% to 25.4%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 62.7%, or approximately $45.3 million, from approximately $72.3 million during 2003 to approximately $117.6 million during 2004, representing approximately 19.6% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains or losses and for the year ended December 31, 2003, non recurring split off costs of $2.0 million related to direct and incremental expenses (e.g., legal and accounting fees, printing and registration costs) incurred by us directly related to our split off from IMS Health. Interest income increased from $2.1 million during 2003 to approximately $4.4 million during 2004. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $14.9 million in 2003 to approximately $21.9 million in 2004, with an effective tax rate of 20.6% in 2003 and 17.9% in 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed to Indias conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $57.4 million in 2003 to approximately $100.2 million in 2004, representing approximately 15.6% and 17.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the one time non 40 Table of Contents recurring split off costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Revenue. Revenue increased by 60.7%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately $229.1 million during 2002 to approximately $368.2 million in 2003. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in both application management and development services, revenue generated from acquisitions and an increase in our active customer base to 153 at the end of 2003 compared to 115 in 2002. We provide services through time and materials and fixed bid contracts. Revenues from fixed bid contracts increased as a percentage of total revenues from 24.6% in 2002 to 25.9% in 2003. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand due to our customers preferring to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 62.8%, or approximately $77.0 million, from approximately $122.7 million during 2002 to approximately $199.7 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $62.1 million, from approximately $106.4 million during 2002 to approximately $168.5 million during 2003. Gross profit margin decreased from 46.4% of revenues during 2002 to 45.8% of revenues in 2003. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 57.2%, or approximately $35.0 million, from approximately $61.2 million during 2002 to approximately $96.2 million during 2003, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.7% to 26.1%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 60.0%, or approximately $27.1 million, from approximately $45.2 million during 2002 to approximately $72.3 million during 2003, representing approximately 19.7% and 19.6% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the lower gross margin partially offset by our ability to leverage prior sales and marketing investments. 41 Table of Contents Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income increased by approximately 17.7%, from approximately $1.8 million during 2002 to approximately $2.1 million during 2003. The increase in such interest income was attributable to higher invested cash balances partially offset by lower global interest rates. We recognized split off costs of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.5 million in 2002 to approximately $14.9 million in 2003, with an effective tax rate of 23.4% in 2002 and 20.6% in 2003. The lower effective tax rate is a result of a reduction in the surtax in India and the restoration of the 100% exemption on export earnings both of which were effective April 1, 2003. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $34.6 million in 2002 to approximately $57.4 million in 2003, representing approximately 15.1% and 15.6% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2003 is primarily attributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. Results by Business Segment During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the completion of organizational changes, we changed our basis of segmentation to industry segments from geographic segments. Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams, who were previously organized based upon geographical segments, have been realigned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. 42 Table of Contents Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, prior periods segment disclosure has been restated to reflect industry segments for all periods presented. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2004 2003 2002 Increase % Increase % Revenues: Financial services $ 290,432 $ 170,370 $ 81,404 $ 120,062 70.5 $ 88,966 109.3 Healthcare 116,370 78,420 55,434 37,950 48.4 22,986 41.5 Manufacturing/retail/ logistics 105,328 64,064 48,788 41,264 64.4 15,276 31.3 Other 74,543 55,377 43,460 19,166 34.6 11,917 27.4 Total revenues $ 586,673 $ 368,231 $ 229,086 $ 218,442 59.3 $ 139,145 60.7 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 104,074 $ 52,412 $ 27,473 $ 51,662 98.6 $ 24,939 90.8 Healthcare 47,294 31,912 22,582 15,382 48.2 9,330 41.3 Manufacturing/retail/ logistics 38,842 24,569 21,522 14,273 58.1 3,047 14.2 Other 30,820 20,964 16,363 9,856 47.0 4,601 28.1 Total segment operating profit $ 221,030 $ 129,857 $ 87,940 $ 91,173 70.2 $ 41,917 47.7 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 70.5%, or approximately $120.1 million, from approximately $170.4 million during 2003 to approximately $290.4 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model as a means of reducing a customers internal IT costs, as well as increased sales and marketing activities directed at both the U.S. and European markets for our services. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 98.6%, or approximately $51.7 million, from approximately $52.4 million during 2003 to approximately $104.1 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving continued leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. 43 Table of Contents Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 48.4%, or approximately $38.0 million, from approximately $78.4 million during 2003 to approximately $116.4 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of services within our existing North American customers. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 48.2%, or approximately $15.4 million, from approximately $31.9 million during 2003 to approximately $47.3 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving continued leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 64.4%, or approximately $41.3 million, from approximately $64.1 million during 2003 to approximately $105.3 million in 2004. The increase in revenue within the manufacturing, logistics and retail groups was driven both by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as a significant number of new customers. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this area as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 58.1%, or approximately $14.3 million, from approximately $24.6 million during 2003 to approximately $38.8 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continuing investment in sales and marketing investments. Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 34.6%, or approximately $19.2 million, from approximately $55.4 million in 2003 to approximately $74.5 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore consulting services delivery model as a means of reducing a customers internal IT costs, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for our services. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 47.0%, or approximately $9.9 million from approximately $21.0 million in 2003 to approximately $30.8 million in 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 109.3%, or approximately $89.0 million, from approximately $81.4 million during 2002 to approximately $170.4 million in 2003. The increase was derived primarily by expansion of our existing customer relationships, in particular with the expansion of our North American customers into other markets, such as Europe. 44 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 90.8%, or approximately $24.9 million, from approximately $27.5 million during 2002 to approximately $52.4 million during 2003. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 41.5%, or approximately $23.0 million, from approximately $55.4 million during 2002 to approximately $78.4 million in 2003. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by expansion of our existing customer relationships. Segment Operating Profit.

The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues. Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 31.3%, or approximately $15.3 million, from approximately $48.8 million during 2002 to approximately $64.1 million during 2003. The increase in revenue within this segment was driven both by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as a significant number of new customers within each of the industry groups operating in this segment. The increase can also be attributed to our achieving leverage on our sales and marketing investments in this area as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 14.2%, or approximately $3.0 million, from approximately $21.5 million during 2002 to approximately $24.6 million during 2003.

Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 28.1%, or approximately $4.6 million from approximately $16.4 million in 2002 to approximately $21.0 million in 2003. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of approximately $314.8 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of 45 Table of Contents existing operations, including our offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $338.9 and $220.6 million, respectively. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $127.3 million, $79.9 million and $56.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002 to approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003 and to approximately $96.4 million at December 31, 2004. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002 to approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003 and increased to approximately $14.2 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2004 was due primarily to increased revenue. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2004, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 59 days as compared to 53 days and 56 days at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $68.4 million, $37.8 million and $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 relates to the investment of a portion of our cash balances in short term bank deposits to achieve a higher return on invested balances and our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development structure. The increase in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily reflects our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure, offset, in part, by lower spending for acquisitions in 2003. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $36.8 million, $21.8 million, and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock, partially offset by payment of split off costs in 2003. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity 46 Table of Contents financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars. We have entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of the Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the U.S. dollar. Our objective is to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract is marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies We have expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned development and training centers to now include over 900,000 square feet of new space as compared to previous plans, announced in December 2003, to add 600,000 square feet of space. The new facilities will be located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, India. Total construction costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $76.0 million, which we expect to fund internally. As of December 31, 2004, we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $22.0 million related to this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $14.7 million has been spent to date. The remaining fixed capital commitments are payable within the next two years. We lease office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2010. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require that we pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands): 2005 $ 12,010 2006 10,139 2007 6,276 2008 5,137 2009 4,187 Thereafter 2,557 Total minimum lease payments $ 40,306 47 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisition of Infopulse, additional purchase price, not to exceed 3.5 million Euros (approximately $4.7 million) is payable in 2006 contingent on Infopulse achieving certain revenue and operating income targets for the 24 month period ending December 31, 2005. In addition, approximately $1.1 million of the total Infopulse purchase price is payable in 2005. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. In connection with the Split Off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation A portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. 48 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 13, 2003 (the Split Off Date), IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the Split Off). As a result of the Split Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million and $20.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. We must adopt SFAS No. 123(R) no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for two transition methods. The basic difference between the two methods is that the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods, whereas the modified retrospective transition method will require restatement. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan. Although the full impact of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method has not yet been determined, we expect that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations. The disclosure under SFAS No. 123 of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had recognized compensation cost for share based payments under SFAS No. 123 for 49 Table of Contents the three years ended December 31, 2004 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share based payments under SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods. The potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) is dependent on levels of share based payments granted, the specific option pricing model utilized to determine fair value and the transition methodology selected. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $314.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. 50 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Overview We are a leading provider of custom IT services related to IT design, development, integration and maintenance services primarily for Fortune 1000 companies located in North America and Europe. Our core competencies include web centric applications, data warehousing, component based development and legacy and client server systems. We provide IT services using an integrated on site/offshore business model. This seamless on site/offshore business model combines technical and account management teams located on site at the customer location and offshore at dedicated development centers located primarily in India. In 2004, our revenue increased to $586.7 million compared to $368.2 million in 2003. Net income increased to $100.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2004 compared to $57.4 million or $0.42 per diluted share in 2003. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our application management and application development and integration services. We finished 2004 with 233 active clients compared to 153 in 2003. We anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue growth in 2005 will come from increased penetration of existing clients. During 2004, 87% of our revenue came from clients in North America. In 2005, we will look to expand our presence in Northern Europe as we are starting to see an increased level of interest for offshore services in that region. In 2004, our operating margin increased to approximately 20.0% compared to 19.6% in 2003. This was consistent with our targeted operating margin range of 19 to 20% of total revenues. At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of $314.8 million, an increase of approximately $121 million compared to December 31, 2003. Our most recent building plans provide for construction of over 900,000 square feet of space in new fully owned development and training centers located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, India. This supersedes our previous plans, announced in December 2003, which included 600,000 square feet of new space. Total construction costs related to this program are currently estimated to be approximately $76.0 million, which we expect to fund primarily from current operations. We believe our financial condition will remain strong. In addition, we will continue to consider acquisitions of companies that can improve our capabilities in certain market niches or geographic areas. On June 29, 2004, we announced our plans to wind down operations at our development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March 31, 2005. We decided to close this facility due to the increased cost structure resulting from the significant appreciation in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar since the facility was acquired in 2002. The work performed in this facility is being transferred to Cognizants operations in North America and India. Currently, we expect to incur through 2005 aggregate incremental costs of approximately $1.6 million associated with the closure of this facility. In 2004, we have recorded expenses of approximately $1.5 million primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of approximately $1.0 million through December 31, 2004. Approximately 50 employees are affected by the closure. 35 Table of Contents On April 12, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a conditional two for one stock split to be effected by a 100% stock dividend payable on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2004. The stock split was subject to stockholder approval which was obtained on May 26, 2004 and, as a result, the stock dividend was paid on June 17, 2004 to stockholders of record as of May 27, 2004. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been restated to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Stockholders equity accounts have been restated to reflect a reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of Class A common stock from the additional paid in capital account to the Class A common stock account. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting, for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of 36 Table of Contents each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten year tax holiday expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to Indian income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. The tax holiday will not be expiring for any STPs in 2005. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes in the amount of approximately $24.1 million on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental U.S. taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2004, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $155.9 million. While we have no plans to do so, if such earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate 37 Table of Contents substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2004. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on earnings recognized prior to 2002 will require adjustment. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act) was enacted into law. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a number of limitations, and as of today, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. As such, we are not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the U.S. Under the provisions of the Act and subject to the completion of our analysis of the Act and the operating results of our controlled foreign entities during 2005, we will be eligible to repatriate some amount between $0 and $500 million. Due to the complexities of domestic and foreign tax law and the lack of clarity surrounding the Act, we cannot reasonably estimate the tax liability if we elect to repatriate any accumulated foreign earnings. We expect to finalize our assessment in 2005 after further guidance is published . The funds may only be repatriated in 2005. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2004, our goodwill balance was approximately $9.7 million. Long lived Assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review for impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance 38 Table of Contents with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1 Business Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2004: (Dollars in thousands) % of % of % of Increase 2004 Revenues 2003 Revenues 2002 Revenues 2004 2003 Revenues $ 586,673 100.0 % $ 368,231 100.0 % $ 229,086 100.0 % $ 218,442 $ 139,145 Cost of revenues 319,810 54.5 199,724 54.2 122,701 53.6 120,086 77,023 Gross profit 266,863 45.5 168,507 45.8 106,385 46.4 98,356 62,122 Selling, general and administrative 132,796 22.7 84,259 22.9 53,345 23.3 48,537 30,914 Depreciation and amortization 16,447 2.8 11,936 3.3 7,842 3.4 4,511 4,094 Income from operations 117,620 20.0 72,312 19.6 45,198 19.7 45,308 27,114 Other income (expense), net 4,475 (81 ) (107 ) 4,556 26 Provision for income taxes (21,852 ) (14,866 ) (10,529 ) 6,986 4,337 Net income $ 100,243 17.1 $ 57,365 15.6 $ 34,562 15.1 42,878 22,803 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenue. Revenue increased by 59.3%, or approximately $218.4 million, from approximately $368.2 million during 2003 to approximately $586.7 million in 2004. This increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2003, including acquisitions. Specifically, our financial services segment accounted for approximately $120 million of the year over year increase. Demand for application development and integration services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers discretionary spending. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% and 10.1% of our revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively. No other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2004 or 2003. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60.1%, or approximately $120.1 million, from approximately $199.7 million during 2003 to approximately $319.8 million in 2004. The 39 Table of Contents increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $98.4 million, from approximately $168.5 million during 2003 to approximately $266.9 million during 2004. Gross profit margin decreased from 45.8% of revenues during 2003 to 45.5% of revenues in 2004. The decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable, in part, to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or approximately $53.0 million, from approximately $96.2 million during 2003 to approximately $149.2 million during 2004, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.1% to 25.4%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 62.7%, or approximately $45.3 million, from approximately $72.3 million during 2003 to approximately $117.6 million during 2004, representing approximately 19.6% and 20.0% of revenues, respectively. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains or losses and for the year ended December 31, 2003, non recurring split off costs of $2.0 million related to direct and incremental expenses (e.g., legal and accounting fees, printing and registration costs) incurred by us directly related to our split off from IMS Health. Interest income increased from $2.1 million during 2003 to approximately $4.4 million during 2004. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $14.9 million in 2003 to approximately $21.9 million in 2004, with an effective tax rate of 20.6% in 2003 and 17.9% in 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed to Indias conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $57.4 million in 2003 to approximately $100.2 million in 2004, representing approximately 15.6% and 17.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the one time non 40 Table of Contents recurring split off costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Revenue. Revenue increased by 60.7%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately $229.1 million during 2002 to approximately $368.2 million in 2003. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in both application management and development services, revenue generated from acquisitions and an increase in our active customer base to 153 at the end of 2003 compared to 115 in 2002. We provide services through time and materials and fixed bid contracts. Revenues from fixed bid contracts increased as a percentage of total revenues from 24.6% in 2002 to 25.9% in 2003. This increase is attributable primarily to increased demand due to our customers preferring to specifically quantify project costs prior to entering into contracts. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 62.8%, or approximately $77.0 million, from approximately $122.7 million during 2002 to approximately $199.7 million in 2003. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services and employees acquired through acquisitions. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $62.1 million, from approximately $106.4 million during 2002 to approximately $168.5 million during 2003. Gross profit margin decreased from 46.4% of revenues during 2002 to 45.8% of revenues in 2003. The decrease in such gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 57.2%, or approximately $35.0 million, from approximately $61.2 million during 2002 to approximately $96.2 million during 2003, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.7% to 26.1%, respectively. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 60.0%, or approximately $27.1 million, from approximately $45.2 million during 2002 to approximately $72.3 million during 2003, representing approximately 19.7% and 19.6% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to the lower gross margin partially offset by our ability to leverage prior sales and marketing investments. 41 Table of Contents Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and split off costs related to the exchange offer in which IMS Health offered to its stockholders to exchange its holdings of our Class B common stock for shares of IMS Health. Interest income increased by approximately 17.7%, from approximately $1.8 million during 2002 to approximately $2.1 million during 2003. The increase in such interest income was attributable to higher invested cash balances partially offset by lower global interest rates. We recognized split off costs of approximately $2.0 million and $1.7 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $10.5 million in 2002 to approximately $14.9 million in 2003, with an effective tax rate of 23.4% in 2002 and 20.6% in 2003. The lower effective tax rate is a result of a reduction in the surtax in India and the restoration of the 100% exemption on export earnings both of which were effective April 1, 2003. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $34.6 million in 2002 to approximately $57.4 million in 2003, representing approximately 15.1% and 15.6% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The higher percentage in 2003 is primarily attributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate discussed above. Results by Business Segment During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the completion of organizational changes, we changed our basis of segmentation to industry segments from geographic segments. Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams, who were previously organized based upon geographical segments, have been realigned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. 42 Table of Contents Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, prior periods segment disclosure has been restated to reflect industry segments for all periods presented. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2004 2003 2002 Increase % Increase % Revenues: Financial services $ 290,432 $ 170,370 $ 81,404 $ 120,062 70.5 $ 88,966 109.3 Healthcare 116,370 78,420 55,434 37,950 48.4 22,986 41.5 Manufacturing/retail/ logistics 105,328 64,064 48,788 41,264 64.4 15,276 31.3 Other 74,543 55,377 43,460 19,166 34.6 11,917 27.4 Total revenues $ 586,673 $ 368,231 $ 229,086 $ 218,442 59.3 $ 139,145 60.7 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 104,074 $ 52,412 $ 27,473 $ 51,662 98.6 $ 24,939 90.8 Healthcare 47,294 31,912 22,582 15,382 48.2 9,330 41.3 Manufacturing/retail/ logistics 38,842 24,569 21,522 14,273 58.1 3,047 14.2 Other 30,820 20,964 16,363 9,856 47.0 4,601 28.1 Total segment operating profit $ 221,030 $ 129,857 $ 87,940 $ 91,173 70.2 $ 41,917 47.7 Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 70.5%, or approximately $120.1 million, from approximately $170.4 million during 2003 to approximately $290.4 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model as a means of reducing a customers internal IT costs, as well as increased sales and marketing activities directed at both the U.S. and European markets for our services. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 98.6%, or approximately $51.7 million, from approximately $52.4 million during 2003 to approximately $104.1 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving continued leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. 43 Table of Contents Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 48.4%, or approximately $38.0 million, from approximately $78.4 million during 2003 to approximately $116.4 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of services within our existing North American customers. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 48.2%, or approximately $15.4 million, from approximately $31.9 million during 2003 to approximately $47.3 million during 2004.

Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 64.4%, or approximately $41.3 million, from approximately $64.1 million during 2003 to approximately $105.3 million in 2004. The increase in revenue within the manufacturing, logistics and retail groups was driven both by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as a significant number of new customers. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this area as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 58.1%, or approximately $14.3 million, from approximately $24.6 million during 2003 to approximately $38.8 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continuing investment in sales and marketing investments. Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 34.6%, or approximately $19.2 million, from approximately $55.4 million in 2003 to approximately $74.5 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore consulting services delivery model as a means of reducing a customers internal IT costs, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the U.S. market for our services. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 47.0%, or approximately $9.9 million from approximately $21.0 million in 2003 to approximately $30.8 million in 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 109.3%, or approximately $89.0 million, from approximately $81.4 million during 2002 to approximately $170.4 million in 2003. The increase was derived primarily by expansion of our existing customer relationships, in particular with the expansion of our North American customers into other markets, such as Europe. 44 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 90.8%, or approximately $24.9 million, from approximately $27.5 million during 2002 to approximately $52.4 million during 2003. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Healthcare Segment Revenue.

The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of approximately $314.8 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of 45 Table of Contents existing operations, including our offshore software development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $338.9 and $220.6 million, respectively. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $127.3 million, $79.9 million and $56.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $36.7 million at December 31, 2002 to approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003 and to approximately $96.4 million at December 31, 2004. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2002 to approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003 and increased to approximately $14.2 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2004 was due primarily to increased revenue. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2004, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 59 days as compared to 53 days and 56 days at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $68.4 million, $37.8 million and $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 compared to 2003 relates to the investment of a portion of our cash balances in short term bank deposits to achieve a higher return on invested balances and our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development structure. The increase in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily reflects our increased investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore development infrastructure, offset, in part, by lower spending for acquisitions in 2003. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $36.8 million, $21.8 million, and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock, partially offset by payment of split off costs in 2003. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity 46 Table of Contents financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars. We have entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of the Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the U.S. dollar. Our objective is to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract is marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies We have expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned development and training centers to now include over 900,000 square feet of new space as compared to previous plans, announced in December 2003, to add 600,000 square feet of space. The new facilities will be located in Chennai, Pune, Calcutta and Bangalore, India. Total construction costs related to this program are expected to be approximately $76.0 million, which we expect to fund internally. As of December 31, 2004, we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $22.0 million related to this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $14.7 million has been spent to date. The remaining fixed capital commitments are payable within the next two years. We lease office space and equipment under operating leases, which expire at various dates through the year 2010. Certain leases contain renewal provisions and generally require that we pay utilities, insurance, taxes, and other operating expenses. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases that have initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2004 are as follows (in thousands): 2005 $ 12,010 2006 10,139 2007 6,276 2008 5,137 2009 4,187 Thereafter 2,557 Total minimum lease payments $ 40,306 47 Table of Contents In connection with our acquisition of Infopulse, additional purchase price, not to exceed 3.5 million Euros (approximately $4.7 million) is payable in 2006 contingent on Infopulse achieving certain revenue and operating income targets for the 24 month period ending December 31, 2005. In addition, approximately $1.1 million of the total Infopulse purchase price is payable in 2005. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. In connection with the Split Off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation A portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to exchange fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. 48 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on February 13, 2003 (the Split Off Date), IMS Health distributed all of the Cognizant common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the Split Off). As a result of the Split Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million and $20.4 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123(R)), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. We must adopt SFAS No. 123(R) no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption is permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005. SFAS No. 123(R) allows for two transition methods. The basic difference between the two methods is that the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods, whereas the modified retrospective transition method will require restatement. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options or stock issuances under the employee stock purchase plan. Although the full impact of our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method has not yet been determined, we expect that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations. The disclosure under SFAS No. 123 of pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had recognized compensation cost for share based payments under SFAS No. 123 for 49 Table of Contents the three years ended December 31, 2004 is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share based payments under SFAS No. 123(R) in future periods. The potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) is dependent on levels of share based payments granted, the specific option pricing model utilized to determine fair value and the transition methodology selected. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $314.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposits which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. 50 Table of Contents
