Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Executive Summary In 2005, our revenues increased to $885.8 million compared to $586.7 million in 2004. Net income increased to $166.3 million or $1.13 per diluted share in 2005 compared to $100.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) of 2004, leading to a one time tax benefit, included in our 2005 results, of approximately $12.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding this one time tax benefit, net income increased to $153.9 million or $1.05 per diluted share in 2005. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2005 were as follows: strong performance of our Financial Services and Healthcare segments. Our Financial Services segment had revenue growth of approximately 52% in 2005 and our Healthcare segment had revenue growth of approximately 51% in 2005; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; and increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 91% of our 2005 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004. During 2005, we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives, complex systems development engagements, testing, customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), data warehousing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 250 active clients compared to 233 in 2004 and added 19 strategic clients in 2005 bring the total number of our strategic clients to 67. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between $5.0 million and $40.0 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 34% and 46%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2005 as compared approximately 38% and 52%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline in future periods. In Europe, we continue to see growth in the UK market and we are starting to see signs of increased demand in continental Europe. Our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 41% in 2005 to $103.7 million compared to $73.7 million in 2004. In 2005, revenue from continental Europe increased by approximately $10.4 million or approximately 83% from approximately $12.5 million in 2004 to approximately $22.9 million in 2005. Continental Europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2006 as we see this area as a growth opportunity for the long term. The balance of our revenue from Europe came from customers in the UK. 42 Table of Contents In 2005, our operating margin increased to approximately 20.1% compared to 20.0% in 2004. This was consistent with our historic targeted operating margin range of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested the profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise, (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings, (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities, (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services and (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery. In addition, we maintain a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. This also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 24,300, an increase of approximately 9,000 over the prior year end. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2005. Turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 14% for 2005. The vast majority of our turnover occurs in India, resulting in on site annualized attrition rates below the global rate. In addition, attrition is weighted toward the most junior members of our staff. We are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as way of reducing overall operating costs. We recently expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned development centers to now include over 1.7 million square feet as compared to previous plans, announced in October 2004 to add 900,000 square feet of space. The 1.7 million square feet of facilities will be located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. The total construction expenditure related to this expanded program is estimated to the approximately $140 million an increase of approximately $64 million when compared to the expansion program announced in October 2004, which we expect to fund primarily from current operations. In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom Solutions, LLC (Fathom), a United States based company specializing in IT consulting in the telecommunications and financial services industries, for initial consideration of approximately $23.3 million in cash and stock. Additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April 30, 2007 and will be recorded when the contingency is resolved. We completed this acquisition primarily to strengthen our service capabilities in the telecommunications industry. We will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry. At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $424.0 million, an increase of approximately $109.2 million compared to December 31, 2004. Further, we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately $507.7 million at the end of 2005; accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. 43 Table of Contents On January 1, 2006, we will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs. We expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to reduce net income in 2006 by an amount slightly above the SFAS No. 123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately $18 million for 2005. Factors that will affect our estimate of the SFAS 123R expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants, and changes to our stock price, volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates during the year in 2006. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting, for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 44 Table of Contents Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income, as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten year tax holiday expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to Indian income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. The tax holiday did not expire for any STPs in 2005. On March 31, 2006, the tax holiday will expire for an additional STP; however, we do not expect the incremental Indian taxes due on the operating profits of this STP to have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as we anticipate the percentage of Indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in India will increase as a percentage of total Indian earnings in 2006. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (currently 33.66%) in effect at such time. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the 45 Table of Contents U.S. instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental United States taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings and total foreign earnings, including unrepatriated Indian earnings, upon which no incremental U.S. taxes has been recorded is approximately $267 million and $283 million, respectively. If such post 2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2005. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on Indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2005, our goodwill balance was approximately $18.2 million. Long lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2005: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 % ofRevenues 2004 % ofRevenues 2003 % ofRevenues Increase 2005 2004 Revenues $ 885,830 100.0 % $ 586,673 100.0 % $ 368,231 100.0 % $ 299,157 $ 218,442 Cost of revenues 479,915 54.2 319,810 54.5 199,724 54.2 160,105 120,086 Gross profit 405,915 45.8 266,863 45.5 168,507 45.8 139,052 98,356 Selling, general and administrative 206,899 23.3 132,796 22.7 84,259 22.9 74,103 48,537 Depreciation and amortization 21,400 2.4 16,447 2.8 11,936 3.3 4,953 4,511 Income from operations 177,616 20.1 117,620 20.0 72,312 19.6 59,996 45,308 Other income (expense), net 7,656 4,475 (81 ) 3,181 4,556 Provision for income taxes 19,006 21,852 14,866 2,846 6,986 Net income $ 166,266 18.8 $ 100,243 17.1 $ 57,365 15.6 66,023 42,878 Net income, as adjusted(1) $ 153,855 17.4 $ 100,243 17.1 $ 57,365 15.6 53,612 42,878 (1) In addition to net income as determined under United States GAAP , we have included net income, as adjusted which is a measure that the Securities and Exchange Commission defines as a non GAAP financial measure. Management believes that such non GAAP financial measure, when read in conjunction with the companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the companys growth. Net income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2005 excludes a one time tax benefit of $12,411 in 2005 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the Act. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.0%, or approximately $299.2 million, from approximately $586.7 million during 2004 to approximately $885.8 million in 2005. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model, our expanding range of service offerings which allowed us to access a larger share of our customers IT budgets, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending, increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2004, including the acquisition of Fathom. In 2005, approximately 91% of our revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004 and the number of our active 47 Table of Contents customers as of year end increased to approximately 250 as compared to approximately 233 at the end of 2004. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately half of our year over year increase in revenue or approximately $150.5 million. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 59% and 44%, respectively, compared to 2004 and represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues in 2005. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2005. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 50.1% or approximately $160.1 million, from approximately $319.8 million during 2004 to approximately $479.9 million in 2005. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 52.1%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately $266.9 million during 2004 to approximately $405.9 million during 2005. Gross profit margin was essentially flat, increasing from 45.5% of revenues during 2004 to 45.8% of revenues in 2005. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 53.0%, or approximately $79.1 million, from approximately $149.2 million during 2004 to approximately $228.3 million during 2005, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.4% in 2004 to approximately 25.8% in 2005. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 51.0%, or approximately $60.0 million, from approximately $117.6 million during 2004 to approximately $177.6 million during 2005, representing essentially unchanged operating margins of approximately 20.1% of revenues in 2005 and 20.0% of revenues in 2004. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income is primarily attributed to an increase in interest income from $4.4 million during 2004 to approximately $9.0 million during 2005 partially offset by a $1.3 million year over year reduction in other income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $21.9 million in 2004 to approximately $19.0 million in 2005. The effective income tax rate decreased from 17.9% in 2004 to 10.3% in 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 48 Table of Contents million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0%, which decreased from the prior year primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $100.2 million in 2004 to approximately $166.3 million in 2005, representing 17.1% and 18.8% of revenues in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the one time tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income as a percentage of revenues excluding the one time benefit was 17.4%. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenue. Revenue increased by 59.3%, or approximately $218.4 million, from approximately $368.2 million during 2003 to approximately $586.7 million in 2004. This increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2003, including acquisitions. Specifically, our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately $120 million of the year over year increase. Demand for our IT consulting and technology services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers discretionary spending. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004 and 10.1% of our revenues in 2003. No other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2004 or 2003. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60.1%, or approximately $120.1 million, from approximately $199.7 million during 2003 to approximately $319.8 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $98.4 million, from approximately $168.5 million during 2003 to approximately $266.9 million during 2004. Gross profit margin decreased from 45.8% of revenues during 2003 to 45.5% of revenues in 2004. The decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable, in part, to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the United States dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or approximately $53.0 million, from approximately $96.2 million during 2003 to approximately $149.2 million during 2004, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.1% in 2003 to 25.4% in 2004. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the United States dollar. 49 Table of Contents Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 62.7%, or approximately $45.3 million, from approximately $72.3 million during 2003 to approximately $117.6 million during 2004, representing approximately 19.6% of revenues during 2003 and 20.0% of revenues during 2004. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses and for the year ended December 31, 2003, non recurring split off costs of $2.0 million related to direct and incremental expenses (e.g., legal and accounting fees, printing and registration costs) incurred by us directly related to our split off from IMS Health. Interest income increased from $2.1 million during 2003 to approximately $4.4 million during 2004. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $14.9 million in 2003 to approximately $21.9 million in 2004, with an effective tax rate of 20.6% in 2003 and 17.9% in 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed to Indias conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $57.4 million in 2003 to approximately $100.2 million in 2004, representing approximately 15.6% and 17.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the one time non recurring split off costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is 50 Table of Contents defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2005 2004 2005 2004 2003 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial services $ 440,958 $ 290,432 $ 170,370 $ 150,526 51.8 $ 120,062 70.5 Healthcare 176,102 116,370 78,420 59,732 51.3 37,950 48.4 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 152,536 105,328 64,064 47,208 44.8 41,264 64.4 Other 116,234 74,543 55,377 41,691 55.9 19,166 34.6 Total revenues $ 885,830 $ 586,673 $ 368,231 $ 299,157 51.0 $ 218,442 59.3 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 153,542 $ 104,074 $ 52,412 $ 49,468 47.5 $ 51,662 98.6 Healthcare 71,226 47,294 31,912 23,932 50.6 15,382 48.2 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 46,210 38,842 24,569 7,368 19.0 14,273 58.1 Other 39,100 30,820 20,964 8,280 26.9 9,856 47.0 Total segment operating profit $ 310,078 $ 221,030 $ 129,857 $ 89,048 40.3 $ 91,173 70.2 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Financial Services Segment Revenue.

Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 98.6%, or approximately $51.7 million, from approximately $52.4 million during 2003 to approximately $104.1 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving continued leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 48.4%, or approximately $38.0 million, from approximately $78.4 million during 2003 to approximately $116.4 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of services within our existing North American customers. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 48.2%, or approximately $15.4 million, from approximately $31.9 million during 2003 to approximately $47.3 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving continued leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 64.4%, or approximately $41.3 million, from approximately $64.1 million during 2003 to approximately $105.3 million in 2004. The increase in revenue within the manufacturing, logistics and retail groups was driven both by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as a significant number of new customers.

Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 58.1%, or approximately $14.3 million, from approximately $24.6 million during 2003 to approximately $38.8 million during 2004. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continuing investment in sales and marketing investments. 53 Table of Contents Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 34.6%, or approximately $19.2 million, from approximately $55.4 million in 2003 to approximately $74.5 million in 2004. The increase in revenue was attributable primarily to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore consulting services delivery model as a means of reducing a customers internal IT costs, as well as sales and marketing activities directed at the United States market for our services.

The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $424.0 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2005, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $507.7 million as compared to working capital of approximately $338.9 million, with no third party debt as of December 31, 2004. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $127.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in 2005 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2005, offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables and the timing of payment of accrued expenses. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003 to approximately $96.4 million at December 31, 2004 and to approximately $154.0 million at December 31, 2005. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003 to approximately $14.2 million at December 31, 2004 and increased to approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2005 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of milestone billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2005, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 63 days as compared to 59 days as of December 31, 2004 and 53 days as of December 31, 2003. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $30.6 million for 54 Table of Contents the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in each year was primarily related to increased investment of excess cash generated from operations in short term investments to achieve a higher return on invested balances and greater investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore IT development centers. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings subsequent to January 1, 2002 from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars, that was settled in January 2005. We entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the United States dollar. Our objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract was marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies We have expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned IT development centers to now include over 1.7 million square feet as compared to previous plans, announced in October 2004 to add 900,000 square feet of space. The 1.7 million square feet of facilities will be located 55 Table of Contents in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. As of December 31, 2005, we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $70.4 million related to this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $48.9 million has been spent to date. As of December 31, 2005, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 52,734 $ 13,848 $ 19,324 $ 14,738 $ 4,824 Fixed capital commitments(1) 21,502 21,502 Other purchase commitments(2) 9,708 5,162 4,546 Total $ 83,944 $ 40,512 $ 23,870 $ 14,738 $ 4,824 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. In connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom, additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April 30, 2007. Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. Any additional payments relating to the achievement of post acquisition financial and operating targets is expected to be funded by cash flows from operations. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there 56 Table of Contents can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. In connection with our Split Off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Exit Activity On June 29, 2004, we announced our plans to wind down operations at our development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, we completed the wind down of our Limerick development facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded expenses of approximately $1.5 million primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of $1.0 million through December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded additional expenses of approximately $0.1 million and made payments of approximately $0.6 million primarily for severance and retention bonuses. All costs have been paid as of December 31, 2005. Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 87% of our revenues are generated from customers located in the United States. However, a portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian Rupee in our Indian subsidiary. 57 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions On February 13, 2003 (the Split Off Date), IMS Health distributed all of our Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the Split Off). In connection with the exchange offer we incurred Split Off costs of $2.0 million in 2003. As a result of the Split Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million in 2003. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when specific transition provisions are not provided. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. In addition, SFAS No. 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods 58 Table of Contents after adoption. Total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules. SFAS No. 123R is effective for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2006. We will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method. Adoption of SFAS No. 123R will reduce our gross margin, operating margin, reported net income and earnings per share because we currently use the intrinsic value method as permitted by APB No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense is currently recognized for stock purchase rights granted under our (i) employee stock option plans since the exercise price equals the fair value of the underlying stock at date of grant and (ii) employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we expect the annualized after tax cost associated with expensing grants under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans, including an estimate of grants to be issued in 2006, to be slightly above the SFAS No. 123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately $18 million for 2005. Factors that will affect our estimate of the SFAS 123R expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants, and changes to our stock price, volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates during the year in 2006. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars that was settled in January 2005. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or 59 Table of Contents depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2005, we had $424.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily AAA rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations Executive Summary In 2005, our revenues increased to $885.8 million compared to $586.7 million in 2004. Net income increased to $166.3 million or $1.13 per diluted share in 2005 compared to $100.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share in 2004. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) of 2004, leading to a one time tax benefit, included in our 2005 results, of approximately $12.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding this one time tax benefit, net income increased to $153.9 million or $1.05 per diluted share in 2005. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2005 were as follows: strong performance of our Financial Services and Healthcare segments. Our Financial Services segment had revenue growth of approximately 52% in 2005 and our Healthcare segment had revenue growth of approximately 51% in 2005; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; and increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 91% of our 2005 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004. During 2005, we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives, complex systems development engagements, testing, customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), data warehousing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 250 active clients compared to 233 in 2004 and added 19 strategic clients in 2005 bring the total number of our strategic clients to 67. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between $5.0 million and $40.0 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 34% and 46%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2005 as compared approximately 38% and 52%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline in future periods. In Europe, we continue to see growth in the UK market and we are starting to see signs of increased demand in continental Europe. Our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 41% in 2005 to $103.7 million compared to $73.7 million in 2004. In 2005, revenue from continental Europe increased by approximately $10.4 million or approximately 83% from approximately $12.5 million in 2004 to approximately $22.9 million in 2005. Continental Europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2006 as we see this area as a growth opportunity for the long term. The balance of our revenue from Europe came from customers in the UK. 42 Table of Contents In 2005, our operating margin increased to approximately 20.1% compared to 20.0% in 2004. This was consistent with our historic targeted operating margin range of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested the profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise, (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings, (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities, (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services and (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery. In addition, we maintain a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. This also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 24,300, an increase of approximately 9,000 over the prior year end. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2005. Turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 14% for 2005. The vast majority of our turnover occurs in India, resulting in on site annualized attrition rates below the global rate. In addition, attrition is weighted toward the most junior members of our staff. We are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as way of reducing overall operating costs. We recently expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned development centers to now include over 1.7 million square feet as compared to previous plans, announced in October 2004 to add 900,000 square feet of space. The 1.7 million square feet of facilities will be located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. The total construction expenditure related to this expanded program is estimated to the approximately $140 million an increase of approximately $64 million when compared to the expansion program announced in October 2004, which we expect to fund primarily from current operations. In April 2005, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom Solutions, LLC (Fathom), a United States based company specializing in IT consulting in the telecommunications and financial services industries, for initial consideration of approximately $23.3 million in cash and stock. Additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April 30, 2007 and will be recorded when the contingency is resolved. We completed this acquisition primarily to strengthen our service capabilities in the telecommunications industry. We will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry. At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $424.0 million, an increase of approximately $109.2 million compared to December 31, 2004. Further, we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately $507.7 million at the end of 2005; accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. 43 Table of Contents On January 1, 2006, we will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, which requires the expensing of our stock compensation programs. We expect the adoption of SFAS 123R to reduce net income in 2006 by an amount slightly above the SFAS No. 123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately $18 million for 2005. Factors that will affect our estimate of the SFAS 123R expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants, and changes to our stock price, volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates during the year in 2006. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting, for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts will differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 44 Table of Contents Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income, as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income or equity (if the deferred tax asset is related to tax benefits from stock option benefits that have not been realized) in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. In 2004, the ten year tax holiday expired for one STP and, accordingly, the export profits for that STP are subject to Indian income tax. Export profits from the remaining STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. The tax holiday did not expire for any STPs in 2005. On March 31, 2006, the tax holiday will expire for an additional STP; however, we do not expect the incremental Indian taxes due on the operating profits of this STP to have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as we anticipate the percentage of Indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in India will increase as a percentage of total Indian earnings in 2006. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (currently 33.66%) in effect at such time. Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the 45 Table of Contents U.S. instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental United States taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings and total foreign earnings, including unrepatriated Indian earnings, upon which no incremental U.S. taxes has been recorded is approximately $267 million and $283 million, respectively. If such post 2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2005. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on Indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2005, our goodwill balance was approximately $18.2 million. Long lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2005: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 % ofRevenues 2004 % ofRevenues 2003 % ofRevenues Increase 2005 2004 Revenues $ 885,830 100.0 % $ 586,673 100.0 % $ 368,231 100.0 % $ 299,157 $ 218,442 Cost of revenues 479,915 54.2 319,810 54.5 199,724 54.2 160,105 120,086 Gross profit 405,915 45.8 266,863 45.5 168,507 45.8 139,052 98,356 Selling, general and administrative 206,899 23.3 132,796 22.7 84,259 22.9 74,103 48,537 Depreciation and amortization 21,400 2.4 16,447 2.8 11,936 3.3 4,953 4,511 Income from operations 177,616 20.1 117,620 20.0 72,312 19.6 59,996 45,308 Other income (expense), net 7,656 4,475 (81 ) 3,181 4,556 Provision for income taxes 19,006 21,852 14,866 2,846 6,986 Net income $ 166,266 18.8 $ 100,243 17.1 $ 57,365 15.6 66,023 42,878 Net income, as adjusted(1) $ 153,855 17.4 $ 100,243 17.1 $ 57,365 15.6 53,612 42,878 (1) In addition to net income as determined under United States GAAP , we have included net income, as adjusted which is a measure that the Securities and Exchange Commission defines as a non GAAP financial measure. Management believes that such non GAAP financial measure, when read in conjunction with the companys reported results, can provide useful supplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the companys growth. Net income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2005 excludes a one time tax benefit of $12,411 in 2005 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the Act. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.0%, or approximately $299.2 million, from approximately $586.7 million during 2004 to approximately $885.8 million in 2005. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model, our expanding range of service offerings which allowed us to access a larger share of our customers IT budgets, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending, increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2004, including the acquisition of Fathom. In 2005, approximately 91% of our revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2004 and the number of our active 47 Table of Contents customers as of year end increased to approximately 250 as compared to approximately 233 at the end of 2004. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately half of our year over year increase in revenue or approximately $150.5 million. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 59% and 44%, respectively, compared to 2004 and represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues in 2005. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2005. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 50.1% or approximately $160.1 million, from approximately $319.8 million during 2004 to approximately $479.9 million in 2005. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 52.1%, or approximately $139.1 million, from approximately $266.9 million during 2004 to approximately $405.9 million during 2005. Gross profit margin was essentially flat, increasing from 45.5% of revenues during 2004 to 45.8% of revenues in 2005. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 53.0%, or approximately $79.1 million, from approximately $149.2 million during 2004 to approximately $228.3 million during 2005, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.4% in 2004 to approximately 25.8% in 2005. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 51.0%, or approximately $60.0 million, from approximately $117.6 million during 2004 to approximately $177.6 million during 2005, representing essentially unchanged operating margins of approximately 20.1% of revenues in 2005 and 20.0% of revenues in 2004. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income is primarily attributed to an increase in interest income from $4.4 million during 2004 to approximately $9.0 million during 2005 partially offset by a $1.3 million year over year reduction in other income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $21.9 million in 2004 to approximately $19.0 million in 2005. The effective income tax rate decreased from 17.9% in 2004 to 10.3% in 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 48 Table of Contents million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0%, which decreased from the prior year primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $100.2 million in 2004 to approximately $166.3 million in 2005, representing 17.1% and 18.8% of revenues in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the one time tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income as a percentage of revenues excluding the one time benefit was 17.4%. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Revenue. Revenue increased by 59.3%, or approximately $218.4 million, from approximately $368.2 million during 2003 to approximately $586.7 million in 2004. This increase resulted primarily from increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2003, including acquisitions. Specifically, our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately $120 million of the year over year increase. Demand for our IT consulting and technology services increased significantly due to continued strength in our customers discretionary spending. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004 and 10.1% of our revenues in 2003. No other customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2004 or 2003. Gross Profit. Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Cost of revenues increased by 60.1%, or approximately $120.1 million, from approximately $199.7 million during 2003 to approximately $319.8 million in 2004. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation costs resulting from the increase in the number of our technical professionals. The increased number of technical professionals is a direct result of greater demand for our services. Our gross profit increased by 58.4%, or approximately $98.4 million, from approximately $168.5 million during 2003 to approximately $266.9 million during 2004. Gross profit margin decreased from 45.8% of revenues during 2003 to 45.5% of revenues in 2004. The decrease in such gross profit margin was attributable, in part, to the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the United States dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 55.1%, or approximately $53.0 million, from approximately $96.2 million during 2003 to approximately $149.2 million during 2004, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.1% in 2003 to 25.4% in 2004. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that have resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the United States dollar. 49 Table of Contents Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 62.7%, or approximately $45.3 million, from approximately $72.3 million during 2003 to approximately $117.6 million during 2004, representing approximately 19.6% of revenues during 2003 and 20.0% of revenues during 2004. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses and for the year ended December 31, 2003, non recurring split off costs of $2.0 million related to direct and incremental expenses (e.g., legal and accounting fees, printing and registration costs) incurred by us directly related to our split off from IMS Health. Interest income increased from $2.1 million during 2003 to approximately $4.4 million during 2004. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested cash balances and an increased portion of this balance held in foreign currencies which earn slightly higher interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $14.9 million in 2003 to approximately $21.9 million in 2004, with an effective tax rate of 20.6% in 2003 and 17.9% in 2004. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2004 is primarily attributed to Indias conversion of the withholding tax on dividends to an additional corporate tax on the distribution of profits. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $57.4 million in 2003 to approximately $100.2 million in 2004, representing approximately 15.6% and 17.1% as a percentage of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior period was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the one time non recurring split off costs referred to above and a lower effective income tax rate for 2004 compared to 2003. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media, information services, telecommunications and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is 50 Table of Contents defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are as follows: 2005 2004 2005 2004 2003 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial services $ 440,958 $ 290,432 $ 170,370 $ 150,526 51.8 $ 120,062 70.5 Healthcare 176,102 116,370 78,420 59,732 51.3 37,950 48.4 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 152,536 105,328 64,064 47,208 44.8 41,264 64.4 Other 116,234 74,543 55,377 41,691 55.9 19,166 34.6 Total revenues $ 885,830 $ 586,673 $ 368,231 $ 299,157 51.0 $ 218,442 59.3 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 153,542 $ 104,074 $ 52,412 $ 49,468 47.5 $ 51,662 98.6 Healthcare 71,226 47,294 31,912 23,932 50.6 15,382 48.2 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 46,210 38,842 24,569 7,368 19.0 14,273 58.1 Other 39,100 30,820 20,964 8,280 26.9 9,856 47.0 Total segment operating profit $ 310,078 $ 221,030 $ 129,857 $ 89,048 40.3 $ 91,173 70.2 Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.8%, or approximately $150.5 million, from approximately $290.4 million during 2004 to approximately $441.0 million in 2005. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as a significant number of new customers and acceptance of our expanded portfolio of services. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. 51 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 47.5%, or approximately $49.5 million, from approximately $104.1 million during 2004 to approximately $153.5 million during 2005. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continuing investment in sales and marketing. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.3%, or approximately $59.7 million, from approximately $116.4 million during 2004 to approximately $176.1 million in 2005. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as a significant number of new customers and acceptance of our expanded portfolio of services. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 50.6%, or approximately $23.9 million, from approximately $47.3 million during 2004 to approximately $71.2 million during 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $424.0 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2005, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $507.7 million as compared to working capital of approximately $338.9 million, with no third party debt as of December 31, 2004. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $127.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in 2005 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2005, offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables and the timing of payment of accrued expenses. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $52.3 million at December 31, 2003 to approximately $96.4 million at December 31, 2004 and to approximately $154.0 million at December 31, 2005. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $9.5 million at December 31, 2003 to approximately $14.2 million at December 31, 2004 and increased to approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2005. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2005 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of milestone billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2005, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 63 days as compared to 59 days as of December 31, 2004 and 53 days as of December 31, 2003. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $30.6 million for 54 Table of Contents the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in each year was primarily related to increased investment of excess cash generated from operations in short term investments to achieve a higher return on invested balances and greater investment in property and equipment to expand our offshore IT development centers. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in each year was primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings subsequent to January 1, 2002 from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement between IMS Health and us, especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars, that was settled in January 2005. We entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the United States dollar. Our objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract was marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies We have expanded our plans to construct additional fully owned IT development centers to now include over 1.7 million square feet as compared to previous plans, announced in October 2004 to add 900,000 square feet of space. The 1.7 million square feet of facilities will be located 55 Table of Contents in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Bangalore, India. As of December 31, 2005, we have entered into fixed capital commitments of approximately $70.4 million related to this India development center expansion program, of which approximately $48.9 million has been spent to date. As of December 31, 2005, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 52,734 $ 13,848 $ 19,324 $ 14,738 $ 4,824 Fixed capital commitments(1) 21,502 21,502 Other purchase commitments(2) 9,708 5,162 4,546 Total $ 83,944 $ 40,512 $ 23,870 $ 14,738 $ 4,824 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. In connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom, additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April 30, 2007. Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. Any additional payments relating to the achievement of post acquisition financial and operating targets is expected to be funded by cash flows from operations. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there 56 Table of Contents can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. In connection with our Split Off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the United States federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Exit Activity On June 29, 2004, we announced our plans to wind down operations at our development center located in Limerick, Ireland and close the facility by March 31, 2005. As of March 31, 2005, we completed the wind down of our Limerick development facility. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded expenses of approximately $1.5 million primarily for severance, retention bonuses and an obligation to repay funds previously received through local job grant programs and made payments of $1.0 million through December 31, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded additional expenses of approximately $0.1 million and made payments of approximately $0.6 million primarily for severance and retention bonuses. All costs have been paid as of December 31, 2005. Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 87% of our revenues are generated from customers located in the United States. However, a portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian Rupee in our Indian subsidiary. 57 Table of Contents Related Party Transactions On February 13, 2003 (the Split Off Date), IMS Health distributed all of our Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to IMS Health stockholders (the Split Off). In connection with the exchange offer we incurred Split Off costs of $2.0 million in 2003. As a result of the Split Off, IMS Health is no longer a related party as of the Split Off Date. Accordingly, our revenues from IMS Health subsequent to the Split Off Date are classified as third party revenues. We recognized related party revenues from IMS Health totaling approximately $2.6 million in 2003. Total revenues from IMS Health during 2003, including related party revenues prior to the Split Off Date, were approximately $22.7 million. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS No. 154 replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when specific transition provisions are not provided. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific or cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123). SFAS No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25), and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and issuances under employee stock purchase plans, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard. In addition, SFAS No. 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under current accounting rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods 58 Table of Contents after adoption. Total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules. SFAS No. 123R is effective for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2006. We will adopt SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, utilizing the modified prospective method. Adoption of SFAS No. 123R will reduce our gross margin, operating margin, reported net income and earnings per share because we currently use the intrinsic value method as permitted by APB No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense is currently recognized for stock purchase rights granted under our (i) employee stock option plans since the exercise price equals the fair value of the underlying stock at date of grant and (ii) employee stock purchase plan. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we expect the annualized after tax cost associated with expensing grants under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans, including an estimate of grants to be issued in 2006, to be slightly above the SFAS No. 123 pro forma stock compensation expense of approximately $18 million for 2005. Factors that will affect our estimate of the SFAS 123R expense for 2006 include the timing and geographic mix of 2006 option grants, and changes to our stock price, volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates during the year in 2006. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars that was settled in January 2005. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or 59 Table of Contents depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2005, we had $424.0 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily AAA rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer.
