For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Employee Stock Based Compensation Plans) to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere herein. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2005, our consolidated statement of operations data includes the reduction of income tax expense (one time income tax benefit) of $12,411, $0.09 per basic earnings per share and $0.08 per diluted earnings per share related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 30 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2006, our revenues increased to $1,424.3 million compared to $885.8 million in 2005. Net income increased to $232.8 million or $1.55 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.16 per diluted share, during 2006. This is compared to $166.3 million or $1.13 per diluted share in 2005, which excludes stock based compensation expense. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) of 2004, leading to a one time tax benefit, included in our 2005 results, of approximately $12.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding this one time tax benefit, net income was $153.9 million or $1.05 per diluted share in 2005. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2006 were as follows: strong performance of our Healthcare segment, which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 88%, and our Other segment which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 75%; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 96% of our 2006 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2005; and greater penetration of the European market. During 2006, we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements, testing, customer relationship management, or CRM, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and data warehousing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 400 active clients compared to 250 in 2005 and added 20 strategic clients in 2006 bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 87. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between $5.0 million and $40.0 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 29% and 39%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2006 as compared to approximately 34% and 46%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. In Europe, we continue to experience strong growth. During 2006, our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 77.3% to approximately $183.9 million compared to approximately $103.7 million in 2005. In 2006, revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $26.1 million or approximately 114.0% from approximately $22.9 million in 2005 to approximately $48.9 million in 2006. Europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2007 as we see this region as a growth opportunity for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT services. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Services Companies) reports state that Indias IT services export industry grew by 33% in the twelve month period ended March 31, 2006, and IT and IT Enabled export services are projected to grow 27% to 30% in the twelve month period ending March 31, 2007. In 2006, our operating margin decreased to approximately 18.2% compared to 20.1% in 2005. Excluding stock based compensation costs of approximately $29.9 million, operating margin in 2006 was approximately 20.3%. This was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested the profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise, (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings, (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities, (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services, (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery, and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, we maintain a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. This also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels. For 2007, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historic targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 38,800, an increase of approximately 14,500 over the prior year end. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2006. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 15.7% for 2006. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, 31 Table of Contents annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted toward the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent less than 20% of our total operating expenses. We are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as a way of reducing overall operating costs. In November 2006, we announced the expansion of our existing India real estate development program to include over three million square feet of new space, which is inclusive of the 900,000 square feet of space that we added to our planned construction program in February 2006. The expanded program includes the expenditure of approximately $200 million through the end of 2008 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new fully owned state of the art development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Coimbatore, India. In September 2006, we acquired AimNet Solutions, Inc. (AimNet), a U.S. based managed infrastructure and professional services firm for initial net cash consideration of approximately $14.8 million. We completed this acquisition to strengthen our IT infrastructure management capabilities. We will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $648.2 million, an increase of approximately $224.2 million compared to December 31, 2005. Further, we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately $790.9 million at the end of 2006; accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, utilizing the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for awards of equity instruments to employees and non employee directors based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Under the modified prospective method, the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), are recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption. Pre tax stock based compensation costs of $29.9 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to non vested stock options expected to vest amounted to approximately $56.2 million, which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service period of 1.97 years. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we followed the intrinsic value method to account for our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Related Interpretations (APB No. 25), as allowed by SFAS No. 123 and as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Accordingly, no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and, with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent. In accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption under SFAS No. 123R, prior period financial statements have not been restated to reflect stock based compensation costs. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under the prior accounting rules. This requirement reduces net operating cash flow and increases net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow remains unchanged from what would have been reported under the prior accounting rules. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 32 Table of Contents circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. Stock Based Compensation. Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to account for stock based awards in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the income tax benefits related to the stock based awards and the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income, as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, we would increase or establish the valuation allowance, which would decrease income in the period such determination is made. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of the Companys STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. On March 31, 2006, the tax holiday expired for a second STP; however, the incremental Indian taxes due on the operating profits of this STP did not have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as the percentage of Indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in India increased as a percentage of total Indian earnings in 2006. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (currently 33.66%) in effect at such time. 33 Table of Contents Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental U.S. taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings and total foreign earnings, including unrepatriated Indian earnings, upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $434.8 million and $457.6 million, respectively. If such post 2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2006. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on Indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2006, our goodwill balance was approximately $27.2 million. Long lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. Additionally, we operate in various countries in Europe and Asia. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2006: (Dollars in thousands) 2006 % ofRevenues 2005 % ofRevenues 2004 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 Revenues $ 1,424,267 100.0 % $ 885,830 100.0 % $ 586,673 100.0 % $ 538,437 $ 299,157 Cost of revenues (1) 787,923 55.3 479,915 54.2 319,810 54.5 308,008 160,105 Selling, general and administrative(2) 343,238 24.1 206,899 23.3 132,796 22.7 136,339 74,103 Depreciation and amortization 34,163 2.4 21,400 2.4 16,447 2.8 12,763 4,953 Income from operations 258,943 18.2 177,616 20.1 117,620 20.0 81,327 59,996 Other income (expense), net 18,868 7,656 4,475 11,212 3,181 Provision for income taxes(3) 45,016 19,006 21,852 26,010 (2,846 ) Net income $ 232,795 16.3 $ 166,266 18.8 $ 100,243 17.1 66,529 66,023 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $13,400 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. 34 Table of Contents (2) Includes stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $16,534 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (3) Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a one time tax benefit of $12,411 in 2005 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the Act. The following tables include certain non GAAP financial measures, namely income from operations on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act. These tables also include reconciliations of income from operations and net income presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to these non GAAP measures. For its internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, management uses financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases, and exclude the income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings for: financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Further, management believes that the presentation of these non GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because our consolidated statement of operations: (i) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 did not reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2005 included a one time tax benefit of approximately $12.4 million related to the repatriation of $60 million of Indian earnings under the Act, and, therefore, the presentation of the non GAAP financial measures enhances investors ability to make period to period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2006 % of Revenues Income from operations, as reported $ 258,943 18.2 % Add: Stock based compensation expense 29,934 2.1 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense $ 288,877 20.3 % A reconciliation of net income as reported and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 % of Revenues Net income, as reported $ 166,266 18.8 % Less: Income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings 12,411 1.4 Non GAAP net income, excluding income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings $ 153,855 17.4 % 35 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenue. Revenue increased by 60.8%, or approximately $538.4 million, from approximately $885.8 million during 2005 to approximately $1,424.3 million in 2006. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 increased by approximately $477.3 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2005 was approximately $61.1 million or approximately 4.3% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, revenue from European customers increased by $80.2 million during 2006. We had approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006 as compared to approximately 250 active clients as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $238.9 million and $154.8 million, respectively, of the $538.4 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 61.4% and 60.2%, respectively, compared to 2005 and represented approximately 48.8% and 51.2%, respectively, of total revenues in 2006. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2006 or 2005. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 64.2% or approximately $308.0 million, from approximately $479.9 million during 2005 to approximately $787.9 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $242.4 million and the inclusion in 2006 of stock based compensation expense of approximately $13.4 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 65.3%, or approximately $149.1 million, from approximately $228.3 million during 2005 to approximately $377.4 million during 2006, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.8% in 2005 to approximately 26.5% in 2006. The percentage increase in such expenses was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $16.5 million or 1.2% of revenues partially offset by the increased the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years and the depreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 45.8%, or approximately $81.3 million, from approximately $177.6 million during 2005 to approximately $258.9 million during 2006, representing operating margins of approximately 18.2% of revenues in 2006 and 20.1% of revenues in 2005. The decrease in operating margin was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $29.9 million, or 2.1% of revenues, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding stock based compensation expense, operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 20.3% of revenues. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $11.2 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $8.6 million from approximately $9.0 million in 2005 to approximately $17.6 million in 2006 plus a period over period increase of approximately $2.6 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $19.0 million in 2005 to approximately $45.0 million in 2006. The effective income tax rate increased from 10.3% in 2005 to 16.2% in 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0% which decreased in 2006 primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $166.3 million in 2005 to approximately $232.8 million in 2006, representing 18.8% and 16.3% of revenues in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to stock based compensation expense recorded in 2006, representing 2.1% of revenues and the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005, representing 1.4% of revenues, offset by the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate, excluding the effect of the repatriation, in 2006 equal to 0.2% of revenues and an increase in other income/expense, net, equal to 0.8% of revenues. 36 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.0%, or approximately $299.2 million, from approximately $586.7 million during 2004 to approximately $885.8 million in 2005. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model, our expanding range of service offerings which allowed us to access a larger share of our customers IT budgets, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending, increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2004, including customers added from the acquisition of Fathom Solutions LLC (Fathom). Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2004 increased by approximately $228.0 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2004 was approximately $71.2 million or approximately 8.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. We had approximately 250 active clients as of December 31, 2005 as compared to approximately 233 active clients as of December 31, 2004. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately half of our year over year increase in revenue or approximately $150.5 million. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 59% and 44%, respectively, compared to 2004 and represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues in 2005. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2005. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 50.1% or approximately $160.1 million, from approximately $319.8 million during 2004 to approximately $479.9 million in 2005. The increase was due to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $132.5 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 53.0%, or approximately $79.1 million, from approximately $149.2 million during 2004 to approximately $228.3 million during 2005, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.4% in 2004 to approximately 25.8% in 2005. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 51.0%, or approximately $60.0 million, from approximately $117.6 million during 2004 to approximately $177.6 million during 2005, representing essentially unchanged operating margins of approximately 20.1% of revenues in 2005 and 20.0% of revenues in 2004. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $3.2 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $4.6 million from approximately $4.4 million during 2004 to approximately $9.0 million during 2005 partially offset by a $1.4 million year over year reduction in other income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $21.9 million in 2004 to approximately $19.0 million in 2005. The effective income tax rate decreased from 17.9% in 2004 to 10.3% in 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0%, which decreased from the prior year primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $100.2 million in 2004 to approximately $166.3 million in 2005, representing 17.1% and 18.8% of revenues in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the one time tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income as a percentage of revenues excluding the one time benefit was 17.4%. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life 37 Table of Contents sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media and information services, telecommunications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial services $ 679,901 $ 440,958 $ 290,432 $ 238,943 54.2 % $ 150,526 51.8 % Healthcare 330,860 176,102 116,370 154,758 87.9 59,732 51.3 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 209,703 152,536 105,328 57,167 37.5 47,208 44.8 Other 203,803 116,234 74,543 87,569 75.3 41,691 55.9 Total revenues $ 1,424,267 $ 885,830 $ 586,673 $ 538,437 60.8 $ 299,157 51.0 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 254,115 $ 153,542 $ 104,074 $ 100,573 65.5 % $ 49,468 47.5 % Healthcare 135,374 71,226 47,294 64,148 90.1 23,932 50.6 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 73,443 46,210 38,842 27,233 58.9 7,368 19.0 Other 63,657 39,100 30,820 24,557 62.8 8,280 26.9 Total segment operating profit $ 526,589 $ 310,078 $ 221,030 $ 216,511 69.8 $ 89,048 40.3 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 54.2%, or approximately $238.9 million, from approximately $441.0 million during 2005 to approximately $679.9 million in 2006. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 and customers added since such date was approximately $220.7 million and approximately $18.2 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our insurance customers, where revenue increased approximately $109.3 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 65.5%, or approximately $100.6 million, from approximately $153.5 million during 2005 to approximately $254.1 million during 2006.

Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 19.0%, or approximately $7.4 million, from approximately $38.8 million during 2004 to approximately $46.2 million during 2005. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues largely offset by significant investments in sales and marketing, client relationship and program management personnel, and program development to accelerate the acquisition and growth of new and existing clients. Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 55.9%, or approximately $41.7 million, from approximately $74.5 million in 2004 to approximately $116.2 million in 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $648.2 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2006, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $790.9 million as compared to working capital of approximately $509.6 million, with no third party debt as of December 31, 2005. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $127.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in 2006 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2006 and the timing of payment of accrued expenses, offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables and the timing of billings of fixed price contracts. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $96.4 million at December 31, 2004 to approximately $154.0 million at December 31, 2005 and to $259.2 million at December 31, 2006. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $14.2 million at December 31, 2004 to approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2005 and to 40 Table of Contents approximately $39.3 at December 31, 2006. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2006 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of milestone billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2006, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 65 days as compared to 63 days as of December 31, 2005 and 59 days as of December 31, 2004. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in each year was primarily related to increased investment of excess cash generated from operations in short term investments to achieve a higher return on invested balances and greater investment to expand our offshore IT development centers. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in 2006 relates to the classification in 2006 of excess tax benefits on employee stock option exercises of approximately $33.2 million in financing activities as required by SFAS No. 123R. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement with IMS Health , especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars, that was settled in January 2005. We entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the United States dollar. Our objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract was marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies In November 2006, we announced the expansion of our existing India real estate development program to include over three million square feet of new space, which is inclusive of the 900,000 square feet of space that we added to our planned construction program in February 2006. The expanded program will include the expenditure of approximately $200 million through the end of 2008 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new fully owned state of the art development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Coimbatore, India. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $57.7 million related to our existing India development center expansion program. As of December 31, 2006, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 113,970 $ 24,361 $ 46,776 $ 35,359 $ 7,474 Fixed capital commitments(1) 57,695 57,695 Other purchase commitments(2) 8,488 8,488 Total $ 180,153 $ 90,544 $ 46,776 $ 35,359 $ 7,474 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. 41 Table of Contents (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. In connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom, additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April 30, 2007. We will fund such payment, if any, from operating cash flow. Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. Any additional payments relating to the achievement of post acquisition financial and operating targets are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. In connection with our split off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 86% of our revenues are generated from customers located in the United States. However, a portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian Rupee in our Indian subsidiary. 42 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. We have experienced wage inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent less than 20% of our total operating expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The pronouncement prescribes an approach whereby the effect of all unrecorded identified errors should be considered on all of the financial statements rather than just either the effect on the balance sheet or the income statement. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires recognition in the financial statements of the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions are effective for our first quarter 2007 financial statements with the cumulative effect, if any, of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the SEC, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars, which was settled in January 2005. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. 43 Table of Contents We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2006, we had $648.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing in primarily AAA rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2006, our revenues increased to $1,424.3 million compared to $885.8 million in 2005. Net income increased to $232.8 million or $1.55 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.16 per diluted share, during 2006. This is compared to $166.3 million or $1.13 per diluted share in 2005, which excludes stock based compensation expense. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act (the Act) of 2004, leading to a one time tax benefit, included in our 2005 results, of approximately $12.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Excluding this one time tax benefit, net income was $153.9 million or $1.05 per diluted share in 2005. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2006 were as follows: strong performance of our Healthcare segment, which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 88%, and our Other segment which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 75%; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 96% of our 2006 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2005; and greater penetration of the European market. During 2006, we saw increasing demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements, testing, customer relationship management, or CRM, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and data warehousing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 400 active clients compared to 250 in 2005 and added 20 strategic clients in 2006 bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 87. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate between $5.0 million and $40.0 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 29% and 39%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2006 as compared to approximately 34% and 46%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2005. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. In Europe, we continue to experience strong growth. During 2006, our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 77.3% to approximately $183.9 million compared to approximately $103.7 million in 2005. In 2006, revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $26.1 million or approximately 114.0% from approximately $22.9 million in 2005 to approximately $48.9 million in 2006. Europe will continue to be an area of heavy investment for us in 2007 as we see this region as a growth opportunity for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT services. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Services Companies) reports state that Indias IT services export industry grew by 33% in the twelve month period ended March 31, 2006, and IT and IT Enabled export services are projected to grow 27% to 30% in the twelve month period ending March 31, 2007. In 2006, our operating margin decreased to approximately 18.2% compared to 20.1% in 2005. Excluding stock based compensation costs of approximately $29.9 million, operating margin in 2006 was approximately 20.3%. This was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested the profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise, (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings, (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities, (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services, (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery, and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, we maintain a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, in order to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. This also has an effect of reducing our operating margins and lowering our utilization levels. For 2007, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historic targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 38,800, an increase of approximately 14,500 over the prior year end. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2006. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 15.7% for 2006. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, 31 Table of Contents annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted toward the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent less than 20% of our total operating expenses. We are continuing with our strategy of moving from leased facilities to owned facilities as a way of reducing overall operating costs. In November 2006, we announced the expansion of our existing India real estate development program to include over three million square feet of new space, which is inclusive of the 900,000 square feet of space that we added to our planned construction program in February 2006. The expanded program includes the expenditure of approximately $200 million through the end of 2008 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new fully owned state of the art development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Coimbatore, India. In September 2006, we acquired AimNet Solutions, Inc. (AimNet), a U.S. based managed infrastructure and professional services firm for initial net cash consideration of approximately $14.8 million. We completed this acquisition to strengthen our IT infrastructure management capabilities. We will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $648.2 million, an increase of approximately $224.2 million compared to December 31, 2005. Further, we had no third party debt and working capital of approximately $790.9 million at the end of 2006; accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123R, utilizing the modified prospective method. SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements for awards of equity instruments to employees and non employee directors based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Under the modified prospective method, the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption, determined under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), are recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption. Pre tax stock based compensation costs of $29.9 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to non vested stock options expected to vest amounted to approximately $56.2 million, which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining requisite service period of 1.97 years. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we followed the intrinsic value method to account for our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and Related Interpretations (APB No. 25), as allowed by SFAS No. 123 and as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Accordingly, no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and, with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent. In accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption under SFAS No. 123R, prior period financial statements have not been restated to reflect stock based compensation costs. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under the prior accounting rules. This requirement reduces net operating cash flow and increases net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. Total cash flow remains unchanged from what would have been reported under the prior accounting rules. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the 32 Table of Contents circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our fixed price contracts are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts cost to date bears to the total estimated cost (cost to cost method). Estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract, and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. Stock Based Compensation. Effective January 1, 2006, we were required to account for stock based awards in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the income tax benefits related to the stock based awards and the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In the period of resolution, adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income, as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions where we operate can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, we would increase or establish the valuation allowance, which would decrease income in the period such determination is made. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located. Our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India, is an export oriented company, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, is entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of the Companys STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March of 2009. On March 31, 2006, the tax holiday expired for a second STP; however, the incremental Indian taxes due on the operating profits of this STP did not have a significant effect on our 2006 effective income tax rate as the percentage of Indian earnings subject to the tax holiday in India increased as a percentage of total Indian earnings in 2006. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (currently 33.66%) in effect at such time. 33 Table of Contents Prior to 2002, it was managements intent to repatriate all accumulated earnings from India to the United States; accordingly, we provided for deferred income taxes on all such undistributed earnings through December 31, 2001. During the first quarter of 2002, we made a strategic decision to pursue an international strategy that includes expanded infrastructure investments in India and geographic expansion in Europe and Asia. As a component of this strategy, beginning in 2002, we intend to use Indian earnings to expand operations outside of the United States instead of repatriating these earnings to the United States. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2002, pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23, we no longer accrue incremental U.S. taxes on Indian earnings as these earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of unrepatriated Indian earnings and total foreign earnings, including unrepatriated Indian earnings, upon which no incremental U.S. taxes have been recorded is approximately $434.8 million and $457.6 million, respectively. If such post 2002 earnings are repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings and pay taxes at a rate substantially higher than our overall effective income tax rate in 2006. Due to the various methods by which such earnings could be repatriated in the future, it is not currently practicable to determine the amount of applicable taxes that would result from such repatriation or whether the amount of previously accrued deferred taxes on Indian earnings recognized prior to 2002 would require adjustment. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2006, our goodwill balance was approximately $27.2 million. Long lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. Additionally, we operate in various countries in Europe and Asia. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 1A, Risk Factors for discussion of additional risks that may affect our business, operations or financial results. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2006: (Dollars in thousands) 2006 % ofRevenues 2005 % ofRevenues 2004 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 Revenues $ 1,424,267 100.0 % $ 885,830 100.0 % $ 586,673 100.0 % $ 538,437 $ 299,157 Cost of revenues (1) 787,923 55.3 479,915 54.2 319,810 54.5 308,008 160,105 Selling, general and administrative(2) 343,238 24.1 206,899 23.3 132,796 22.7 136,339 74,103 Depreciation and amortization 34,163 2.4 21,400 2.4 16,447 2.8 12,763 4,953 Income from operations 258,943 18.2 177,616 20.1 117,620 20.0 81,327 59,996 Other income (expense), net 18,868 7,656 4,475 11,212 3,181 Provision for income taxes(3) 45,016 19,006 21,852 26,010 (2,846 ) Net income $ 232,795 16.3 $ 166,266 18.8 $ 100,243 17.1 66,529 66,023 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $13,400 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. 34 Table of Contents (2) Includes stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $16,534 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (3) Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a one time tax benefit of $12,411 in 2005 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the Act. The following tables include certain non GAAP financial measures, namely income from operations on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act. These tables also include reconciliations of income from operations and net income presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to these non GAAP measures. For its internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, management uses financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases, and exclude the income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings for: financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Further, management believes that the presentation of these non GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because our consolidated statement of operations: (i) for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 did not reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and (ii) for the year ended December 31, 2005 included a one time tax benefit of approximately $12.4 million related to the repatriation of $60 million of Indian earnings under the Act, and, therefore, the presentation of the non GAAP financial measures enhances investors ability to make period to period comparisons of our operating results. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2006 % of Revenues Income from operations, as reported $ 258,943 18.2 % Add: Stock based compensation expense 29,934 2.1 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense $ 288,877 20.3 % A reconciliation of net income as reported and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 % of Revenues Net income, as reported $ 166,266 18.8 % Less: Income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings 12,411 1.4 Non GAAP net income, excluding income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings $ 153,855 17.4 % 35 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenue. Revenue increased by 60.8%, or approximately $538.4 million, from approximately $885.8 million during 2005 to approximately $1,424.3 million in 2006. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 increased by approximately $477.3 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2005 was approximately $61.1 million or approximately 4.3% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, revenue from European customers increased by $80.2 million during 2006. We had approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006 as compared to approximately 250 active clients as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $238.9 million and $154.8 million, respectively, of the $538.4 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 61.4% and 60.2%, respectively, compared to 2005 and represented approximately 48.8% and 51.2%, respectively, of total revenues in 2006. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2006 or 2005. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 64.2% or approximately $308.0 million, from approximately $479.9 million during 2005 to approximately $787.9 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $242.4 million and the inclusion in 2006 of stock based compensation expense of approximately $13.4 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 65.3%, or approximately $149.1 million, from approximately $228.3 million during 2005 to approximately $377.4 million during 2006, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.8% in 2005 to approximately 26.5% in 2006. The percentage increase in such expenses was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $16.5 million or 1.2% of revenues partially offset by the increased the leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years and the depreciation of the Indian Rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 45.8%, or approximately $81.3 million, from approximately $177.6 million during 2005 to approximately $258.9 million during 2006, representing operating margins of approximately 18.2% of revenues in 2006 and 20.1% of revenues in 2005. The decrease in operating margin was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $29.9 million, or 2.1% of revenues, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding stock based compensation expense, operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 20.3% of revenues. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $11.2 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $8.6 million from approximately $9.0 million in 2005 to approximately $17.6 million in 2006 plus a period over period increase of approximately $2.6 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $19.0 million in 2005 to approximately $45.0 million in 2006. The effective income tax rate increased from 10.3% in 2005 to 16.2% in 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0% which decreased in 2006 primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $166.3 million in 2005 to approximately $232.8 million in 2006, representing 18.8% and 16.3% of revenues in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to stock based compensation expense recorded in 2006, representing 2.1% of revenues and the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005, representing 1.4% of revenues, offset by the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate, excluding the effect of the repatriation, in 2006 equal to 0.2% of revenues and an increase in other income/expense, net, equal to 0.8% of revenues. 36 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.0%, or approximately $299.2 million, from approximately $586.7 million during 2004 to approximately $885.8 million in 2005. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model, our expanding range of service offerings which allowed us to access a larger share of our customers IT budgets, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending, increased revenue from existing customers and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2004, including customers added from the acquisition of Fathom Solutions LLC (Fathom). Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2004 increased by approximately $228.0 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2004 was approximately $71.2 million or approximately 8.0% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. We had approximately 250 active clients as of December 31, 2005 as compared to approximately 233 active clients as of December 31, 2004. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services segment accounted for approximately half of our year over year increase in revenue or approximately $150.5 million. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 59% and 44%, respectively, compared to 2004 and represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of total revenues in 2005. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues in 2005. JPMorgan Chase accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2004. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration, relocation and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 50.1% or approximately $160.1 million, from approximately $319.8 million during 2004 to approximately $479.9 million in 2005. The increase was due to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $132.5 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 53.0%, or approximately $79.1 million, from approximately $149.2 million during 2004 to approximately $228.3 million during 2005, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.4% in 2004 to approximately 25.8% in 2005. The increase in such expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to expenses incurred to expand our sales and marketing activities and increased infrastructure expenses to support our growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 51.0%, or approximately $60.0 million, from approximately $117.6 million during 2004 to approximately $177.6 million during 2005, representing essentially unchanged operating margins of approximately 20.1% of revenues in 2005 and 20.0% of revenues in 2004. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $3.2 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $4.6 million from approximately $4.4 million during 2004 to approximately $9.0 million during 2005 partially offset by a $1.4 million year over year reduction in other income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due primarily to higher invested balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased from approximately $21.9 million in 2004 to approximately $19.0 million in 2005. The effective income tax rate decreased from 17.9% in 2004 to 10.3% in 2005. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2005 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0%, which decreased from the prior year primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $100.2 million in 2004 to approximately $166.3 million in 2005, representing 17.1% and 18.8% of revenues in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the one time tax benefit resulting from the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net income as a percentage of revenues excluding the one time benefit was 17.4%. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life 37 Table of Contents sciences customers; Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media and information services, telecommunications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense is not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial services $ 679,901 $ 440,958 $ 290,432 $ 238,943 54.2 % $ 150,526 51.8 % Healthcare 330,860 176,102 116,370 154,758 87.9 59,732 51.3 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 209,703 152,536 105,328 57,167 37.5 47,208 44.8 Other 203,803 116,234 74,543 87,569 75.3 41,691 55.9 Total revenues $ 1,424,267 $ 885,830 $ 586,673 $ 538,437 60.8 $ 299,157 51.0 Segment Operating Profit: Financial services $ 254,115 $ 153,542 $ 104,074 $ 100,573 65.5 % $ 49,468 47.5 % Healthcare 135,374 71,226 47,294 64,148 90.1 23,932 50.6 Manufacturing/retail/logistics 73,443 46,210 38,842 27,233 58.9 7,368 19.0 Other 63,657 39,100 30,820 24,557 62.8 8,280 26.9 Total segment operating profit $ 526,589 $ 310,078 $ 221,030 $ 216,511 69.8 $ 89,048 40.3 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 54.2%, or approximately $238.9 million, from approximately $441.0 million during 2005 to approximately $679.9 million in 2006. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 and customers added since such date was approximately $220.7 million and approximately $18.2 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our insurance customers, where revenue increased approximately $109.3 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 65.5%, or approximately $100.6 million, from approximately $153.5 million during 2005 to approximately $254.1 million during 2006.

Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 62.8%, or approximately $24.6 million from approximately $39.1 million in 2005 to approximately $63.7 million in 2006. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continued investment in sales and marketing. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 51.8%, or approximately $150.5 million, from approximately $290.4 million during 2004 to approximately $441.0 million in 2005.

Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 44.8%, or approximately $47.2 million, from approximately $105.3 million during 2004 to approximately $152.5 million in 2005. The increase in revenue within the manufacturing, logistics and retail groups was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenues from new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2004 and customers added during 2005 was approximately $39.2 million and approximately $8.0 million, respectively. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 19.0%, or approximately $7.4 million, from approximately $38.8 million during 2004 to approximately $46.2 million during 2005. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues largely offset by significant investments in sales and marketing, client relationship and program management personnel, and program development to accelerate the acquisition and growth of new and existing clients. Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 55.9%, or approximately $41.7 million, from approximately $74.5 million in 2004 to approximately $116.2 million in 2005. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $648.2 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; and (v) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2006, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $790.9 million as compared to working capital of approximately $509.6 million, with no third party debt as of December 31, 2005. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $127.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in 2006 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2006 and the timing of payment of accrued expenses, offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables and the timing of billings of fixed price contracts. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $96.4 million at December 31, 2004 to approximately $154.0 million at December 31, 2005 and to $259.2 million at December 31, 2006. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $14.2 million at December 31, 2004 to approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2005 and to 40 Table of Contents approximately $39.3 at December 31, 2006. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2006 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of milestone billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2006, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 65 days as compared to 63 days as of December 31, 2005 and 59 days as of December 31, 2004. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in each year was primarily related to increased investment of excess cash generated from operations in short term investments to achieve a higher return on invested balances and greater investment to expand our offshore IT development centers. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 and $36.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in 2006 relates to the classification in 2006 of excess tax benefits on employee stock option exercises of approximately $33.2 million in financing activities as required by SFAS No. 123R. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily related to a higher level of cash proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases of stock. We believe that our available funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond this 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, our ability not to breach the Distribution Agreement with IMS Health , especially as it relates to our tax indemnities, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for United States dollars, that was settled in January 2005. We entered into this forward contract to manage a portion of our foreign currency risk related to Indian Rupee denominated asset balances, primarily cash investments, at our Indian subsidiary, Cognizant India. Movement in the exchange rate for the Indian Rupee results in foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement of Cognizant Indias financial statements into its functional currency, the United States dollar. Our objective was to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee by offsetting a portion of such exposure with gains or losses on the forward contract, referred to above. The forward contract was marked to market and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported along with foreign currency gains or losses in the caption other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Commitments and Contingencies In November 2006, we announced the expansion of our existing India real estate development program to include over three million square feet of new space, which is inclusive of the 900,000 square feet of space that we added to our planned construction program in February 2006. The expanded program will include the expenditure of approximately $200 million through the end of 2008 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new fully owned state of the art development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in Chennai, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Coimbatore, India. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $57.7 million related to our existing India development center expansion program. As of December 31, 2006, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 113,970 $ 24,361 $ 46,776 $ 35,359 $ 7,474 Fixed capital commitments(1) 57,695 57,695 Other purchase commitments(2) 8,488 8,488 Total $ 180,153 $ 90,544 $ 46,776 $ 35,359 $ 7,474 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. 41 Table of Contents (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. In connection with the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Fathom, additional purchase price, not to exceed $16.0 million, payable in 2007, is contingent on Fathom achieving certain financial and operating targets over the two years ended April 30, 2007. We will fund such payment, if any, from operating cash flow. Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. Any additional payments relating to the achievement of post acquisition financial and operating targets are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. In connection with our split off from IMS Health, we entered into a Distribution Agreement, dated January 7, 2003, with IMS Health, referred to as the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement provides, among other things, that IMS Health and we will comply with, and not take any action during the relevant time period that is inconsistent with, the representations made to and relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. In addition, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, we indemnified IMS Health for any tax liability to which they may be subject as a result of the exchange offer but only to the extent that such tax liability resulted solely from a breach in the representations we made to and were relied upon by McDermott, Will & Emery in connection with rendering its opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the exchange offer. If we breach any of our representations in connection with the Distribution Agreement, the related indemnification liability could be material to our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 86% of our revenues are generated from customers located in the United States. However, a portion of our costs in India are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian Rupee in our Indian subsidiary. 42 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. We have experienced wage inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent less than 20% of our total operating expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The pronouncement prescribes an approach whereby the effect of all unrecorded identified errors should be considered on all of the financial statements rather than just either the effect on the balance sheet or the income statement. We adopted the provisions of SAB 108 as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48 requires recognition in the financial statements of the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions are effective for our first quarter 2007 financial statements with the cumulative effect, if any, of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the SEC, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian Rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. During July 2004, we entered into a foreign currency forward contract, with a six month term and notional amount of $12.5 million, to sell the Indian Rupee for U.S. dollars, which was settled in January 2005. We may continue to enter into such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. Other than the aforementioned forward contract, we have not engaged in hedging activities nor have we entered into off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. 43 Table of Contents We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2006, we had $648.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing in primarily AAA rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer.
