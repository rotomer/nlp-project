For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Employee Stock Based Compensation Plans) to our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere herein. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2005, our consolidated statement of operations data includes the reduction of income tax expense (one time income tax benefit) of $12,411, $0.05 per basic earnings per share and $0.04 per diluted earnings per share related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2007, our revenues increased to $2,135.6 million compared to $1,424.3 million in 2006. Net income increased to $350.1 million or $1.15 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, net of tax, equal to $0.12 per diluted share, during 2007. This is compared to $232.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.09 per diluted share, during 2006. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2007 were as follows: greater penetration of the European market, where we experienced revenue growth of 86.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006; strong performance of our Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics segment, which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 52.7% and our Healthcare segment, which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 52.5%; 30 Table of Contents continued strength of our Financial Services segment and Other segment, particularly with our media and information services customers; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 96.2% of our 2007 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2006; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 500 active clients compared to 400 as of December 31, 2006 and increased the number of strategic clients by 20 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 107. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 24% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2007 as compared to approximately 29% and 39%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. In Europe, we continue to experience strong growth. During 2007, our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 86.5% to approximately $342.9 million compared to approximately $183.9 million in 2006. In 2007, revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $72.9 million from approximately $48.9 million in 2006 to approximately $121.8 million. Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us in 2008 as we see this region as a growth opportunity for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports state that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors were an estimated $31.3 billion industry in 2007 with IT software and services exports and business process outsourcing exports growing 36% and 34%, respectively, in 2007. The Indian IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to grow to greater than $60 billion by the year 2010. In 2007, our operating margin decreased to approximately 17.9% compared to 18.2% in 2006. Excluding stock based compensation costs of approximately $35.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million, operating margin in 2007 was approximately 19.8%. This was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings; (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities; (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For 2008, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business. In 2007, we experienced pressure on our cost structure due to the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. This is in addition to the continuing wage inflation, primarily in India, that we have experienced over the last several years. Approximately 31% of our global costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 were denominated in the Indian rupee. The appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar during 2007 had the effect of decreasing our operating margin by approximately 210 basis points or 2.1 percentage points in 2007 as compared to 2006. Each additional 1% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 percentage points. During 2007, we implemented actions that mitigated these negative cost trends, including increasing our global utilization rates of our technical staff and reducing discretionary spending. Accordingly we believe this balanced response, at current exchange rates, will permit us to continue to maintain operating margins in our historic targeted operating margin range, which excludes stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues and permit us to continue to make the necessary investments to continue to grow the company. 31 Table of Contents We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 55,400, an increase of approximately 16,600 over the prior year. The increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2007. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 15% for 2007. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent approximately 20% of our total operating expenses. Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.3 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330 million through the end of 2009 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. During 2008, we expect to spend approximately $250 million globally for capital expenditures, the majority of which relates to our India real estate development program. In addition, we plan to selectively lease space in Special Economic Zones located in India to take advantage of tax incentives and meet our capacity requirements. At December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $670.4 million and working capital of approximately $901.5 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2007, we repurchased $105.4 million of our Class A common stock under a $200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors that expires in September 2008. Stock repurchases under this program must be funded from working capital. Also, in November 2007, we acquired marketRx, Inc., or marketRx, a U.S. based leading provider of data analytics and process outsourcing for initial net cash consideration of approximately $135.9 million (including direct transaction costs). The marketRx acquisition will strengthen our life sciences industry expertise as well as our data analytics capabilities, which we expect to leverage across multiple industries. The operating results of marketRx included in our 2007 consolidated financial statements were immaterial. In 2008, we will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry. On September 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split which was effected by a 100% stock dividend paid on October 16, 2007 to stockholders of record as of October 1, 2007. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. In addition, our stockholders equity accounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of Class A common stock from the additional paid in capital account to the Class A common stock account. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of short term investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed priced contracts, are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost 32 Table of Contents method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial. Stock Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which stock options will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock, the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and, beginning in 2007, due to a recent tax law change in India, the expected exercise proceeds for stock based awards subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, Cognizant India, are export oriented companies, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March 2009. The incremental Indian taxes related to the taxable STPs have been incorporated into our effective income tax rate for 2007. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.99% as of December 31, 2007) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2009, we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2009. Short term Investments. As of December 31, 2007, we had $330.6 million in short term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process and in corporate notes and bonds, U.S. government agencies, bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria. We classify our marketable securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. We evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our available for sale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. 33 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2007, our goodwill balance was approximately $148.8 million. Long Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.

(2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $18,710 and $16,534 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $3,943 for the year ended December 31, 2007 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (3) Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a one time tax benefit of $12,411 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 34 Table of Contents The following tables include certain non GAAP financial measures, namely income from operations on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Act. These non GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense, stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense and the income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Further, management believes that the presentation of these non GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 did not reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and included a one time tax benefit of approximately $12.4 million related to the repatriation of $60 million of Indian earnings under the Act. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under SFAS No. 123R, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations and non GAAP net income when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations and GAAP net income can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations and non GAAP net income versus income from operations and net income reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense that are recurring and a one time tax benefit of related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act. Stock based compensation and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and non GAAP net income, and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2007 % ofRevenues 2006 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 381,522 17.9 % $ 258,943 18.2 % Add: stock based compensation expense 35,916 1.7 29,934 2.1 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 5,922 0.2 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 423,360 19.8 % $ 288,877 20.3 % 35 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income as reported and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 % ofRevenues Net income, as reported $ 166,266 18.8 % Less: Income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings 12,411 1.4 Non GAAP net income, excluding income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings $ 153,855 17.4 % Effective April 1, 2007, a new fringe benefit tax was introduced in India that obligates us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There is no cash cost to us as we recover the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. Our future operating results may experience volatility as a result of the timing of exercise or distribution of shares related to stock based compensation awards to our employees who worked or are working in India. The amount of stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense recorded during 2007 was $5.9 million. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Revenue. Revenue increased by 49.9%, or approximately $711.3 million, from approximately $1,424.3 million during 2006 to approximately $2,135.6 million in 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately $630.4 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2006 was approximately $80.9 million or approximately 3.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2007 increased by $159.0 million as compared to 2006. We had approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007 as compared to approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services with all of our business segments experiencing year over year revenue growth between 47.3% and 52.7%. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $321.5 million and $173.6 million, respectively, of the $711.3 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 48.4% and 51.4%, respectively, compared to 2006 and represented approximately 48.4% and 51.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2007. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 53.1% or approximately $418.1 million, from approximately $787.9 million during 2006 to approximately $1,206.0 million in 2007. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $381.9 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 45.2%, or approximately $170.6 million, from approximately $377.4 million during 2006 to approximately $548.0 million during 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.5% in 2006 to approximately 25.7% in 2007. The percentage decrease was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending partially offset by of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 47.3%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $258.9 million during 2006 to approximately $381.5 million during 2007, representing operating margins of approximately 17.9% of revenues in 2007 and 18.2% of revenues in 2006. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India, partially offset by 36 Table of Contents cost containment actions such as control of discretionary spending and scale efficiencies, including increased utilization rates of our technical staff, and lower stock compensation costs as a percentage of revenues. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $35.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million in 2007 and stock based compensation expense of $29.9 million in 2006, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 19.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $14.0 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $12.0 million from approximately $17.6 million in 2006 to approximately $29.6 million in 2007 and a year over year increase of approximately $2.0 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $45.0 million in 2006 to approximately $64.2 million in 2007. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.2% in 2006 to 15.5% in 2007 primarily due to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007, including $2.9 million upon the expiration of the U.S. Federal income tax statute of limitations for previously recorded uncertain income tax positions and a net benefit of $0.7 million attributed to the effective settlement of certain foreign income tax positions. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased due to net reductions in statutory income tax rates. Excluding discrete items, the Companys effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 16.4%. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $232.8 million in 2006 to approximately $350.1 million in 2007, representing 16.3% and 16.4% of revenues in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenue. Revenue increased by 60.8%, or approximately $538.4 million, from approximately $885.8 million during 2005 to approximately $1,424.3 million in 2006. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 increased by approximately $477.3 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2005 was approximately $61.1 million or approximately 4.3% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, revenue from European customers increased by $80.2 million during 2006. We had approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006 as compared to approximately 250 active clients as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $238.9 million and $154.8 million, respectively, of the $538.4 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 61.4% and 60.2%, respectively, compared to 2005 and represented approximately 48.8% and 51.2%, respectively, of total revenues in 2006. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 64.2% or approximately $308.0 million, from approximately $479.9 million during 2005 to approximately $787.9 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $242.4 million and the inclusion in 2006 of stock based compensation expense of approximately $13.4 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 65.3%, or approximately $149.1 million, from approximately $228.3 million during 2005 to approximately $377.4 million during 2006, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.8% in 2005 to approximately 26.5% in 2006. The percentage increase in such expenses was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $16.5 million or 1.2% of revenues partially offset by the increased leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years and the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 45.8%, or approximately $81.3 million, from approximately $177.6 million during 2005 to approximately $258.9 million during 2006, representing operating margins of approximately 18.2% of revenues in 2006 and 20.1% of revenues in 2005. The decrease in operating margin was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $29.9 million, or 2.1% of revenues, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding stock based compensation expense, operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 20.3% of revenues. 37 Table of Contents Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $11.2 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $8.6 million from approximately $9.0 million in 2005 to approximately $17.6 million in 2006 plus a period over period increase of approximately $2.6 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $19.0 million in 2005 to approximately $45.0 million in 2006. The effective income tax rate increased from 10.3% in 2005 to 16.2% in 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0% which decreased in 2006 primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $166.3 million in 2005 to approximately $232.8 million in 2006, representing 18.8% and 16.3% of revenues in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to stock based compensation expense recorded in 2006, representing 2.1% of revenues and the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005, representing 1.4% of revenues, offset by the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate, excluding the effect of the repatriation, in 2006 equal to 0.2% of revenues and an increase in other income/expense, net, equal to 0.8% of revenues. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based India fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 2007 2006 2007 2006 2005 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,001,420 $ 679,901 $ 440,958 $ 321,519 47.3 % $ 238,943 54.2 % Healthcare 504,504 330,860 176,102 173,644 52.5 154,758 87.9 Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics 320,116 209,703 152,536 110,413 52.7 57,167 37.5 Other 309,537 203,803 116,234 105,734 51.9 87,569 75.3 Total revenues $ 2,135,577 $ 1,424,267 $ 885,830 $ 711,310 49.9 $ 538,437 60.8 Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 355,696 $ 254,115 $ 153,542 $ 101,581 40.0 % $ 100,573 65.5 % Healthcare 199,791 135,374 71,226 64,417 47.6 64,148 90.1 Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics 108,480 73,443 46,210 35,037 47.7 27,233 58.9 Other 111,319 63,657 39,100 47,662 74.9 24,557 62.8 Total segment operating profit $ 775,286 $ 526,589 $ 310,078 $ 248,697 47.2 $ 216,511 69.8 38 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 47.3%, or approximately $321.5 million, from approximately $679.9 million during 2006 to approximately $1,001.4 million in 2007. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 and customers added since such date was approximately $301.5 million and approximately $20.0 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our banking customers, where revenue increased approximately $253.9 million over the prior year including significant growth from our European banking clients, which accounted for 28.9% of the segment growth over the prior year. The business challenges experienced by the financial services industry during the last six months of 2007 did not have material impact on our business. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model.

The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continued investment in sales and marketing. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $670.4 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; (v) stock repurchases; and (vi) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2007, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $901.5 million as compared to working capital of approximately $790.9 million as of December 31, 2006. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in 2007 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2007 offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables, the timing of payment of accrued expenses and the timing of billings of fixed price contracts. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $154.0 million at December 31, 2005 to approximately $259.2 million at December 31, 2006 and to approximately $383.0 million at December 31, 2007. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2005 to approximately $39.3 at December 31, 2006 and to approximately $53.5 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2007 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2007, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 67 days as compared to 65 days as of December 31, 2006 and 63 days as of December 31, 2005. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in each year was primarily related to greater investment to expand our offshore IT development centers and, in 2007, attributed to payments for the acquisition of marketRx and a contingent purchase price payment relating to our acquisition of Fathom. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in 2007 relates primarily to Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, offset, in part, by higher proceeds and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. The increase in 2006 relates to the classification in 2006 of excess tax benefits on employee stock option exercises of approximately $33.2 million in financing activities as required by SFAS No. 123R. As of December 31, 2007, our short term investments included $282.8 million of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans. As of February 26, 2008, we held $176.3 million in AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95% of the underlying student loans are backed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). In addition, the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue. During the period February 14, 2008 to February 26, 2008, auctions failed for $71.1 million of the auction rate securities held by us. There is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed. 41 Table of Contents The current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term. The funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security, the underlying security matures or a buyer outside the auction process emerges. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities. In addition, we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position. However, if such losses become other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We believe we will be able to recover our investment in auction rate municipal debt securities due to: (i) the strength of the underlying collateral, substantially backed by FFELP, (ii) the AAA credit rating of the securities held by us and (iii) recent news that certain municipal issuers of auction rate securities with failed auctions have announced plans to call such securities. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. If future auctions continue to fail, we believe the issuers of the auction rate securities held by us will begin to call these securities to avoid paying the higher penalty interest rates associated with failed auctions. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security (up to 33 years) to realize our investments recorded value. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Commitments and Contingencies Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.3 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330 million through the end of 2009 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $126.7 million related to our India development center expansion program. During 2007, we repurchased $105.4 million of our Class A common stock under a $200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors that expires in September 2008. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 275,306 $ 51,040 $ 104,957 $ 86,837 $ 32,472 Fixed capital commitments(1) 126,658 126,658 Other purchase commitments(2) 89,115 31,640 57,475 Total $ 491,079 $ 209,338 $ 162,432 $ 86,837 $ 32,472 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. 42 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, we had $7.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 83% of our revenues are generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 31% of our global operating costs are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiary. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. We have experienced wage inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent approximately 20% of our total operating expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is required to be met before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 of $0.85 million was recorded as a reduction of beginning retained earnings. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations." This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquiring company: recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) further changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including: acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred; acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies; in process research and development (IPRD) will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed 43 Table of Contents subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which is effective for our financial statements beginning January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157 2 which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. Effective for 2008, we will adopt SFAS No. 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP SFAS No. 157 2. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the SEC, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and may use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $670.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily in AAA/Aaa rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. 44 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, our short term investments included $282.8 million of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans. As of February 26, 2008, we held $176.3 million in AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95% of the underlying student loans are backed by the FFELP. In addition, the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue. During the period February 14, 2008 to February 26, 2008, auctions failed for $71.1 million of the auction rate securities held by us as investments. There is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed. The current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term. The funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security, the underlying security matures (up to 33 years) or a buyer outside the auction process emerges. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities. In addition, we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position. However, if such losses become other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2007, our revenues increased to $2,135.6 million compared to $1,424.3 million in 2006. Net income increased to $350.1 million or $1.15 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, net of tax, equal to $0.12 per diluted share, during 2007. This is compared to $232.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.09 per diluted share, during 2006. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2007 were as follows: greater penetration of the European market, where we experienced revenue growth of 86.5% in 2007 as compared to 2006; strong performance of our Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics segment, which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 52.7% and our Healthcare segment, which had year over year revenue growth of approximately 52.5%; 30 Table of Contents continued strength of our Financial Services segment and Other segment, particularly with our media and information services customers; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers. Specifically, 96.2% of our 2007 revenues were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2006; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 500 active clients compared to 400 as of December 31, 2006 and increased the number of strategic clients by 20 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 107. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for approximately 24% and 34%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2007 as compared to approximately 29% and 39%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. In Europe, we continue to experience strong growth. During 2007, our revenue from European customers increased by approximately 86.5% to approximately $342.9 million compared to approximately $183.9 million in 2006. In 2007, revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $72.9 million from approximately $48.9 million in 2006 to approximately $121.8 million. Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us in 2008 as we see this region as a growth opportunity for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports state that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors were an estimated $31.3 billion industry in 2007 with IT software and services exports and business process outsourcing exports growing 36% and 34%, respectively, in 2007. The Indian IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to grow to greater than $60 billion by the year 2010. In 2007, our operating margin decreased to approximately 17.9% compared to 18.2% in 2006. Excluding stock based compensation costs of approximately $35.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million, operating margin in 2007 was approximately 19.8%. This was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings; (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities; (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a deep bench of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For 2008, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business. In 2007, we experienced pressure on our cost structure due to the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. This is in addition to the continuing wage inflation, primarily in India, that we have experienced over the last several years. Approximately 31% of our global costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 were denominated in the Indian rupee. The appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar during 2007 had the effect of decreasing our operating margin by approximately 210 basis points or 2.1 percentage points in 2007 as compared to 2006. Each additional 1% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 percentage points. During 2007, we implemented actions that mitigated these negative cost trends, including increasing our global utilization rates of our technical staff and reducing discretionary spending. Accordingly we believe this balanced response, at current exchange rates, will permit us to continue to maintain operating margins in our historic targeted operating margin range, which excludes stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues and permit us to continue to make the necessary investments to continue to grow the company. 31 Table of Contents We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 55,400, an increase of approximately 16,600 over the prior year. The increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2007. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 15% for 2007. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent approximately 20% of our total operating expenses. Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.3 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330 million through the end of 2009 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. During 2008, we expect to spend approximately $250 million globally for capital expenditures, the majority of which relates to our India real estate development program. In addition, we plan to selectively lease space in Special Economic Zones located in India to take advantage of tax incentives and meet our capacity requirements. At December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $670.4 million and working capital of approximately $901.5 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2007, we repurchased $105.4 million of our Class A common stock under a $200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors that expires in September 2008. Stock repurchases under this program must be funded from working capital. Also, in November 2007, we acquired marketRx, Inc., or marketRx, a U.S. based leading provider of data analytics and process outsourcing for initial net cash consideration of approximately $135.9 million (including direct transaction costs). The marketRx acquisition will strengthen our life sciences industry expertise as well as our data analytics capabilities, which we expect to leverage across multiple industries. The operating results of marketRx included in our 2007 consolidated financial statements were immaterial. In 2008, we will continue to look for acquisitions that will strengthen our presence in a particular geographic area and increase our capabilities in a specific technology or industry. On September 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a two for one stock split which was effected by a 100% stock dividend paid on October 16, 2007 to stockholders of record as of October 1, 2007. The stock split has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and all applicable references as to the number of outstanding common shares and per share information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split as if it occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. In addition, our stockholders equity accounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in issued shares of Class A common stock from the additional paid in capital account to the Class A common stock account. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of short term investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed priced contracts, are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost 32 Table of Contents method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial. Stock Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which stock options will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock, the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and, beginning in 2007, due to a recent tax law change in India, the expected exercise proceeds for stock based awards subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, Cognizant India, are export oriented companies, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March 2009. The incremental Indian taxes related to the taxable STPs have been incorporated into our effective income tax rate for 2007. In anticipation of the complete phase out of the tax holidays in March 2009, we expect to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZ). Development centers operating in SEZ will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2009 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.99% as of December 31, 2007) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2009, we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2009. Short term Investments. As of December 31, 2007, we had $330.6 million in short term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process and in corporate notes and bonds, U.S. government agencies, bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria. We classify our marketable securities as available for sale at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. We evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our available for sale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. 33 Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2007, our goodwill balance was approximately $148.8 million. Long Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. Most of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with an unqualified report as to the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2007: (Dollars in thousands) 2007 % ofRevenues 2006 % ofRevenues 2005 % ofRevenues Increase 2007 2006 Revenues $ 2,135,577 100.0 % $ 1,424,267 100.0 % $ 885,830 100.0 % $ 711,310 $ 538,437 Cost of revenues (1) 1,206,035 56.5 787,923 55.3 479,915 54.2 418,112 308,008 Selling, general and administrative(2) 494,102 23.1 343,238 24.1 206,899 23.3 150,864 136,339 Depreciation and amortization 53,918 2.5 34,163 2.4 21,400 2.4 19,755 12,763 Income from operations 381,522 17.9 258,943 18.2 177,616 20.1 122,579 81,327 Other income (expense), net 32,834 18,868 7,656 13,966 11,212 Provision for income taxes(3) 64,223 45,016 19,006 19,207 26,010 Net income $ 350,133 16.4 $ 232,795 16.3 $ 166,266 18.8 117,338 66,529 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $17,206 and $13,400 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $1,979 for the year ended December 31, 2007 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $18,710 and $16,534 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $3,943 for the year ended December 31, 2007 and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (3) Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2005 includes a one time tax benefit of $12,411 related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 34 Table of Contents The following tables include certain non GAAP financial measures, namely income from operations on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Act. These non GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non GAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense, stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense and the income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Further, management believes that the presentation of these non GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 did not reflect the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and included a one time tax benefit of approximately $12.4 million related to the repatriation of $60 million of Indian earnings under the Act. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under SFAS No. 123R, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results to those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations and non GAAP net income when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations and GAAP net income can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations and non GAAP net income versus income from operations and net income reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense that are recurring and a one time tax benefit of related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act. Stock based compensation and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and non GAAP net income, and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2007 % ofRevenues 2006 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 381,522 17.9 % $ 258,943 18.2 % Add: stock based compensation expense 35,916 1.7 29,934 2.1 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 5,922 0.2 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 423,360 19.8 % $ 288,877 20.3 % 35 Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income as reported and net income on a non GAAP basis, excluding the impact of a one time tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings under the Act is as follows for the year ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 % ofRevenues Net income, as reported $ 166,266 18.8 % Less: Income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings 12,411 1.4 Non GAAP net income, excluding income tax benefit related to the repatriation of Indian earnings $ 153,855 17.4 % Effective April 1, 2007, a new fringe benefit tax was introduced in India that obligates us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There is no cash cost to us as we recover the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. Our future operating results may experience volatility as a result of the timing of exercise or distribution of shares related to stock based compensation awards to our employees who worked or are working in India. The amount of stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense recorded during 2007 was $5.9 million. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Revenue. Revenue increased by 49.9%, or approximately $711.3 million, from approximately $1,424.3 million during 2006 to approximately $2,135.6 million in 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately $630.4 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2006 was approximately $80.9 million or approximately 3.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2007 increased by $159.0 million as compared to 2006. We had approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007 as compared to approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services with all of our business segments experiencing year over year revenue growth between 47.3% and 52.7%. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $321.5 million and $173.6 million, respectively, of the $711.3 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 48.4% and 51.4%, respectively, compared to 2006 and represented approximately 48.4% and 51.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2007. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 53.1% or approximately $418.1 million, from approximately $787.9 million during 2006 to approximately $1,206.0 million in 2007. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $381.9 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 45.2%, or approximately $170.6 million, from approximately $377.4 million during 2006 to approximately $548.0 million during 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.5% in 2006 to approximately 25.7% in 2007. The percentage decrease was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending partially offset by of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 47.3%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $258.9 million during 2006 to approximately $381.5 million during 2007, representing operating margins of approximately 17.9% of revenues in 2007 and 18.2% of revenues in 2006. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India, partially offset by 36 Table of Contents cost containment actions such as control of discretionary spending and scale efficiencies, including increased utilization rates of our technical staff, and lower stock compensation costs as a percentage of revenues. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $35.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million in 2007 and stock based compensation expense of $29.9 million in 2006, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 19.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $14.0 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $12.0 million from approximately $17.6 million in 2006 to approximately $29.6 million in 2007 and a year over year increase of approximately $2.0 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $45.0 million in 2006 to approximately $64.2 million in 2007. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.2% in 2006 to 15.5% in 2007 primarily due to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007, including $2.9 million upon the expiration of the U.S. Federal income tax statute of limitations for previously recorded uncertain income tax positions and a net benefit of $0.7 million attributed to the effective settlement of certain foreign income tax positions. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased due to net reductions in statutory income tax rates. Excluding discrete items, the Companys effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 16.4%. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $232.8 million in 2006 to approximately $350.1 million in 2007, representing 16.3% and 16.4% of revenues in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Revenue. Revenue increased by 60.8%, or approximately $538.4 million, from approximately $885.8 million during 2005 to approximately $1,424.3 million in 2006. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued strength in our customers discretionary spending and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 increased by approximately $477.3 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2005 was approximately $61.1 million or approximately 4.3% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, revenue from European customers increased by $80.2 million during 2006. We had approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006 as compared to approximately 250 active clients as of December 31, 2005. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $238.9 million and $154.8 million, respectively, of the $538.4 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 61.4% and 60.2%, respectively, compared to 2005 and represented approximately 48.8% and 51.2%, respectively, of total revenues in 2006. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 64.2% or approximately $308.0 million, from approximately $479.9 million during 2005 to approximately $787.9 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $242.4 million and the inclusion in 2006 of stock based compensation expense of approximately $13.4 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 65.3%, or approximately $149.1 million, from approximately $228.3 million during 2005 to approximately $377.4 million during 2006, and increased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 25.8% in 2005 to approximately 26.5% in 2006. The percentage increase in such expenses was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $16.5 million or 1.2% of revenues partially offset by the increased leverage achieved from increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years and the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 45.8%, or approximately $81.3 million, from approximately $177.6 million during 2005 to approximately $258.9 million during 2006, representing operating margins of approximately 18.2% of revenues in 2006 and 20.1% of revenues in 2005. The decrease in operating margin was due to stock based compensation expense of approximately $29.9 million, or 2.1% of revenues, recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. Excluding stock based compensation expense, operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2006 was 20.3% of revenues. 37 Table of Contents Other Income/Expense, Net. Other income/expense, net consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/expense, net of $11.2 million is attributed to an increase in interest income of $8.6 million from approximately $9.0 million in 2005 to approximately $17.6 million in 2006 plus a period over period increase of approximately $2.6 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income is due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $19.0 million in 2005 to approximately $45.0 million in 2006. The effective income tax rate increased from 10.3% in 2005 to 16.2% in 2006. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily attributed to the one time benefit of approximately $12.4 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 in connection with the repatriation of $60.0 million of Indian earnings under the Act. The effective income tax rate in 2005, excluding the one time benefit was 17.0% which decreased in 2006 primarily due to the overall growth in our business which resulted in a greater percentage of our Indian earnings falling under the income tax holiday. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $166.3 million in 2005 to approximately $232.8 million in 2006, representing 18.8% and 16.3% of revenues in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to stock based compensation expense recorded in 2006, representing 2.1% of revenues and the repatriation of Indian earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005, representing 1.4% of revenues, offset by the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate, excluding the effect of the repatriation, in 2006 equal to 0.2% of revenues and an increase in other income/expense, net, equal to 0.8% of revenues. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other reportable segment includes media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based India fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and adjusted only against the total income from operations. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 2007 2006 2007 2006 2005 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,001,420 $ 679,901 $ 440,958 $ 321,519 47.3 % $ 238,943 54.2 % Healthcare 504,504 330,860 176,102 173,644 52.5 154,758 87.9 Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics 320,116 209,703 152,536 110,413 52.7 57,167 37.5 Other 309,537 203,803 116,234 105,734 51.9 87,569 75.3 Total revenues $ 2,135,577 $ 1,424,267 $ 885,830 $ 711,310 49.9 $ 538,437 60.8 Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 355,696 $ 254,115 $ 153,542 $ 101,581 40.0 % $ 100,573 65.5 % Healthcare 199,791 135,374 71,226 64,417 47.6 64,148 90.1 Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics 108,480 73,443 46,210 35,037 47.7 27,233 58.9 Other 111,319 63,657 39,100 47,662 74.9 24,557 62.8 Total segment operating profit $ 775,286 $ 526,589 $ 310,078 $ 248,697 47.2 $ 216,511 69.8 38 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Financial Services Segment Revenue.

The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. 40 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 58.9%, or approximately $27.2 million, from approximately $46.2 million during 2005 to approximately $73.4 million during 2006. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and achieving operating efficiencies, including continued leverage on prior sales and marketing investments. Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 75.3%, or approximately $87.6 million, from approximately $116.2 million in 2005 to approximately $203.8 million in 2006. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2005 and customers added since such date was approximately $67.2 million and approximately $20.4 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our media and information services customers, where revenue increased approximately $37.3 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the onsite/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 62.8%, or approximately $24.6 million from approximately $39.1 million in 2005 to approximately $63.7 million in 2006. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues partially offset by continued investment in sales and marketing. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2007, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $670.4 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; (v) stock repurchases; and (vi) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2007, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $901.5 million as compared to working capital of approximately $790.9 million as of December 31, 2006. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in 2007 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2007 offset, in part, by slower collections of receivables, the timing of payment of accrued expenses and the timing of billings of fixed price contracts. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $154.0 million at December 31, 2005 to approximately $259.2 million at December 31, 2006 and to approximately $383.0 million at December 31, 2007. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $22.7 million at December 31, 2005 to approximately $39.3 at December 31, 2006 and to approximately $53.5 million at December 31, 2007. The increase in trade accounts receivable during 2007 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. Unbilled receivables increased primarily due to increased revenue and the timing of billings for certain fixed price contracts. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2007, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 67 days as compared to 65 days as of December 31, 2006 and 63 days as of December 31, 2005. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in each year was primarily related to greater investment to expand our offshore IT development centers and, in 2007, attributed to payments for the acquisition of marketRx and a contingent purchase price payment relating to our acquisition of Fathom. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease in 2007 relates primarily to Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, offset, in part, by higher proceeds and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. The increase in 2006 relates to the classification in 2006 of excess tax benefits on employee stock option exercises of approximately $33.2 million in financing activities as required by SFAS No. 123R. As of December 31, 2007, our short term investments included $282.8 million of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans. As of February 26, 2008, we held $176.3 million in AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95% of the underlying student loans are backed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). In addition, the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue. During the period February 14, 2008 to February 26, 2008, auctions failed for $71.1 million of the auction rate securities held by us. There is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed. 41 Table of Contents The current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term. The funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security, the underlying security matures or a buyer outside the auction process emerges. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities. In addition, we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position. However, if such losses become other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. We believe we will be able to recover our investment in auction rate municipal debt securities due to: (i) the strength of the underlying collateral, substantially backed by FFELP, (ii) the AAA credit rating of the securities held by us and (iii) recent news that certain municipal issuers of auction rate securities with failed auctions have announced plans to call such securities. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. If future auctions continue to fail, we believe the issuers of the auction rate securities held by us will begin to call these securities to avoid paying the higher penalty interest rates associated with failed auctions. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security (up to 33 years) to realize our investments recorded value. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Commitments and Contingencies Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.3 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330 million through the end of 2009 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $126.7 million related to our India development center expansion program. During 2007, we repurchased $105.4 million of our Class A common stock under a $200 million stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors that expires in September 2008. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 275,306 $ 51,040 $ 104,957 $ 86,837 $ 32,472 Fixed capital commitments(1) 126,658 126,658 Other purchase commitments(2) 89,115 31,640 57,475 Total $ 491,079 $ 209,338 $ 162,432 $ 86,837 $ 32,472 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. 42 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, we had $7.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation Overall, we believe that we are not exposed to significant revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 83% of our revenues are generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 31% of our global operating costs are denominated in local currency and subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which has an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which results in non operating foreign exchange gains and losses. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiary. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered have caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. We have experienced wage inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represent approximately 20% of our total operating expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2007, we adopted FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is required to be met before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 of $0.85 million was recorded as a reduction of beginning retained earnings. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141(R), "Business Combinations." This Statement replaces FASB Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations." SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquiring company: recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non controlling interest in the acquiree; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) further changes the accounting treatment for certain specific items, including: acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred; acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies; in process research and development (IPRD) will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will be generally expensed 43 Table of Contents subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that SFAS No. 160 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which is effective for our financial statements beginning January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, on February 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157 2 which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). This FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. Effective for 2008, we will adopt SFAS No. 157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in FSP SFAS No. 157 2. We are currently evaluating the potential impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the SEC, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, capital expenditures, and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and may use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we have not entered into any hedging contracts or off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $670.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily in AAA/Aaa rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. 44 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2007, our short term investments included $282.8 million of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans. As of February 26, 2008, we held $176.3 million in AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities of which approximately 95% of the underlying student loans are backed by the FFELP. In addition, the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are generally collateralized by assets that are in excess of the total par value of the security issue. During the period February 14, 2008 to February 26, 2008, auctions failed for $71.1 million of the auction rate securities held by us as investments. There is no assurance that successful auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed. The current instability in the credit markets may affect our ability to liquidate these securities in the short term. The funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security, the underlying security matures (up to 33 years) or a buyer outside the auction process emerges. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not necessarily a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities. In addition, we believe that any potential future unrealized gain or loss associated with these securities will be temporary and will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of financial position. However, if such losses become other than temporary, an impairment charge would be recorded to our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.
