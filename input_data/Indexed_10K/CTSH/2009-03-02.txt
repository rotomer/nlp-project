For additional information, refer to Note 10 (Employee Stock Based Compensation Plans) to our consolidated financial statements. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2005, our consolidated statement of operations data includes the reduction of income tax expense (one time income tax benefit) of $12,411, $0.05 per basic earnings per share and $0.04 per diluted earnings per share related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 39 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2008, our revenues increased to $2,816.3 million compared to $2,135.6 million in 2007. Net income increased to $430.8 million or $1.44 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.15 per diluted share during 2008. This is compared to $350.1 million or $1.15 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.12 per diluted share during 2007. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2008 were as follows: strong performance across all our business segments, each of which had year over year revenue growth equal to or greater than 28.2%; greater penetration of the European market, where we experienced revenue growth of 57.8% in 2008 as compared to 2007; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 565 active clients compared to approximately 500 as of December 31, 2007 and increased the number of strategic clients by 21 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 128. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 19.4% and 30.0%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2008 as compared to 23.9% and 34.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. In Europe, we continue to experience solid growth. During 2008, our revenue from European customers increased by 57.8% to $541.1 million compared to $342.9 million in 2007. In 2008, revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by $91.3 million from $121.8 million in 2007 to $213.1 million. Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us in 2009 as we see this region and the Asia Pacific region, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports state that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach an estimated $47 billion by the end of the fiscal year March 31, 2009. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 16% to 17% over the prior fiscal year. In 2008, our operating margin increased to 18.3% compared to 17.9% in 2007. Excluding stock based compensation costs of $43.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $8.1 million, operating margin in 2008 was 20.2%. This was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of our revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation costs. Historically, we have 40 Table of Contents invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings; (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities; (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For 2009, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business. During 2008, we experienced slower than initially expected revenue growth primarily due to the slowing global economy and softness in the financial services sector. This along with the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar during the first half of 2008 and continuing wage inflation, primarily in India, put pressure on our operating margins. In response, we implemented actions during the year that mitigated these negative market trends, including increasing the global utilization rates of our technical staff and reducing discretionary spending. In the second half of 2008, we benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, which favorably impacted our full year over year operating margin by approximately 119 basis points or 1.19 percent. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 percentage points. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 61,700, an increase of approximately 6,300 over the prior year. The increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2008. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 14.2% for 2008. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20% of our total operating expenses. Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million through the end of the program on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. During 2009, we expect to spend approximately $175 million globally for capital expenditures, a portion of which relates to our India real estate development program. At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $762.6 million and working capital of approximately $1,080.5 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2008, we repurchased $27.8 million of our Class A common stock under a stock repurchase program that expired in September 2008. Stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital. On December 3, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million stock repurchase program, which expires in December 2009 and has similar terms to the previous program. No shares were repurchased under this program in December 2008. During 2009, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Slowing global economy, particularly weakness in the United States and the United Kingdom; Continued weakness in the financial services sector; Pressure on customer IT budgets, which may result in delays or decreases in spending by customers on discretionary projects, specifically application development projects. However, we expect a focus by customers 41 Table of Contents on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; and Foreign currency volatility. In response to this challenging macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Partner with our existing customers to see where we can provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Expand our BPO and infrastructure management practices, which are in high demand in this challenging business environment; Continue to aggressively increase our customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that can improve our overall service delivery capabilities; and Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed priced contracts, are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial. 42 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock, the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and, beginning in 2007, due to a recent tax law change in India, the expected exercise proceeds for stock based awards subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax. In addition, for stock performance units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries (collectively, Cognizant India) are export oriented companies, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March 2010. In anticipation of the complete phase out of these tax holidays in March 2010, we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Development centers operating in SEZs will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2010 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.99% as of December 31, 2008) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively 43 Table of Contents extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2010, we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2010. Investments. Historically, our investments have been in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process, corporate notes and bonds, U.S. government agencies, bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria. We evaluate our available for sale investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our available for sale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. Determining the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity requires judgment, including determining the appropriate holding period and discount rate to be used in valuing such securities. We value our investment in auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates the following key inputs: (i) the underlying structure of each security; (ii) frequency and amounts of cash flows; (iii) expected holding period for the security; and (iv) discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security. In estimating the holding period, we considered the current developments in the auction rate market including: our ability to hold the securities for such period of time, recent calls of auction rate securities by issuers and the possible reestablishment of an active market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Based upon these factors, we used a holding period of five years for securities with a stated maturity beyond five years, which represents the period of time we anticipate will elapse before a liquidity event will occur. An increase or decrease in the holding period by two years would change the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $10.0 million. We derive the discount rate by considering observable interest rate yields for bonds supported by student loans and pricing of new bond issuances, and adding an illiquidity premium to such rates. The illiquidity premium was estimated by management considering current market conditions. As of December 31, 2008, we used a weighted average illiquidity premium of 140 basis points. This weighted average illiquidity premium has been impacted by overall issues within the credit and capital markets and related increases in volatility including uncertainty of the credit and money markets. An increase or decrease to the illiquidity premium of 100 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $6.0 million. Our valuation is also impacted by changes in market interest rates because the interest payments we receive on our auction rate securities vary based on a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. An increase or decrease in market interest rates of 50 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $9.0 million. We anticipate there will be ongoing developments in the credit markets and the market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Accordingly, our estimates of the expected holding period and illiquidity premium used in valuing such securities are reasonably likely to change in the short term. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2008, our goodwill balance was $154.0 million. Long Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever 44 Table of Contents events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with reasonable assurance regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.

(2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $25,185, $18,710 and $16,534 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5,418 and $3,943 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. 45 Table of Contents The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under SFAS No. 123R, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense that are recurring. Stock based compensation and the related Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2008 % ofRevenues 2007 % ofRevenues 2006 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 516,670 18.3 % $ 381,522 17.9 % $ 258,943 18.2 % Add: stock based compensation expense 43,900 1.6 35,916 1.7 29,934 2.1 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 8,149 0.3 5,922 0.2 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 568,719 20.2 % $ 423,360 19.8 % $ 288,877 20.3 % Effective April 1, 2007, a new fringe benefit tax was introduced in India that obligates us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the 46 Table of Contents appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There is no cash cost to us as we recover the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. Our future operating results may experience volatility as a result of the timing of exercise or distribution of shares related to stock based compensation awards to our employees who worked or are working in India. The amount of stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense recorded during 2008 and 2007 was $8.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenue. Revenue increased by 31.9%, or approximately $680.7 million, from approximately $2,135.6 million during 2007 to approximately $2,816.3 million in 2008. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the on site/offshore delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 increased by approximately $550.3 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2007 was approximately $130.4 million or approximately 4.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2008 increased by $198.3 million as compared to 2007. We had approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008 as compared to approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $282.6 million and $183.7 million, respectively, of the $680.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 28.0% and 35.5%, respectively, compared to 2007 and represented approximately 46.9% and 53.1%, respectively, of total revenues in 2008. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 30.4% or $366.8 million from $1,206.0 million during 2007 to $1,572.8 million in 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $326.0 million, which is primarily attributed to the increase in the number of our technical personnel. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.6%, or $178.8 million, from $548.0 million during 2007 to $726.8 million during 2008, and increased slightly as a percentage of revenue from 25.7% in 2007 to 25.8% in 2008. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 35.4%, or $135.2 million, from approximately $381.5 million during 2007 to approximately $516.7 million during 2008, representing operating margins of approximately 18.3% of revenues in 2008 and 17.9% of revenues in 2007. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to increased revenues, achieving operating efficiencies including leverage on prior sales and marketing investments and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $52.0 million in 2008 and $41.8 million in 2007, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 20.2% and 19.8%, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Other Income/(Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net decreased from $32.8 million of income in 2007 to $1.5 million of expense in 2008 or by $34.3 million and consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. This $34.3 million decrease is attributed to a period over period decrease of $26.0 million in foreign currency income attributed to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, euro and Indian rupee, and a reduction of $7.4 million in interest income, from approximately $29.6 million in 2007 to $22.2 million in 2008. In 2008, foreign currency losses were approximately $22.8 million, which are primarily attributed to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower average short term interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $64.2 million in 2007 to approximately $84.4 million in 2008. The effective income tax rate increased from 15.5% in 2007 to 16.4% in 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate is primarily attributed to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007 resulting from the settlement of and expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax provisions and, in 2008, a net return to provision adjustment of $2.4 million. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 15.9% for 2008 compared to 16.4% for 2007. This decrease was primarily due to our overall growth, which resulted in a greater percentage of Cognizant Indias revenues falling under the income tax holiday, growth in countries whose tax rates are lower than the United States and net reductions in statutory income tax rates, primarily in Europe. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $350.1 million in 2007 to approximately $430.8 million in 2008, representing 16.4% and 15.3% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2008 is primarily attributed to the decrease in interest income and the foreign currency losses in 2008, partially offset by a higher operating margin in 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Revenue. Revenue increased by 49.9%, or approximately $711.3 million, from approximately $1,424.3 million during 2006 to approximately $2,135.6 million in 2007. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, strength in our customers discretionary spending and penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately $630.4 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2006 was approximately $80.9 million or approximately 3.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2007 increased by $159.0 million as compared to 2006. We had approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007 as compared to approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services with all of our business segments experiencing year over year revenue growth between 47.3% and 52.7%. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $321.5 million and $173.6 million, respectively, of the $711.3 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 48.4% and 51.4%, respectively, compared to 2006 and represented approximately 48.4% and 51.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2007. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 53.1% or approximately $418.1 million, from approximately $787.9 million during 2006 to approximately $1,206.0 million in 2007. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $381.9 million. 48 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 45.2%, or approximately $170.6 million, from approximately $377.4 million during 2006 to approximately $548.0 million during 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.5% in 2006 to approximately 25.7% in 2007. The percentage decrease was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending, partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 47.3%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $258.9 million during 2006 to approximately $381.5 million during 2007, representing operating margins of approximately 17.9% of revenues in 2007 and 18.2% of revenues in 2006. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India, partially offset by cost containment actions such as control of discretionary spending and scale efficiencies, including increased utilization rates of our technical staff, and lower stock compensation costs as a percentage of revenues. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $35.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million in 2007 and stock based compensation expense of $29.9 million in 2006, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 19.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Other Income/(Expense), Net. Other income/(expense), net consisted primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/(expense), net of $14.0 million was attributed to an increase in interest income of $12.0 million from approximately $17.6 million in 2006 to approximately $29.6 million in 2007 and a year over year increase of approximately $2.0 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income was due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $45.0 million in 2006 to approximately $64.2 million in 2007. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.2% in 2006 to 15.5% in 2007 primarily due to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007, including $2.9 million upon the expiration of the U.S. federal income tax statute of limitations for previously recorded uncertain income tax positions and a net benefit of $0.7 million attributed to the effective settlement of certain foreign income tax positions. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased due to net reductions in statutory income tax rates. Excluding discrete items, the Companys effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 16.4%. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $232.8 million in 2006 to approximately $350.1 million in 2007, representing 16.3% and 16.4% of revenues in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. 49 Table of Contents Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based India fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and are adjusted only against the total income from operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 565 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: 2008 2007 2008 2007 2006 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,284,013 $ 1,001,420 $ 679,901 $ 282,593 28.2 % $ 321,519 47.3 % Healthcare 688,224 504,504 330,860 183,720 36.4 173,644 52.5 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 443,236 320,116 209,703 123,120 38.5 110,413 52.7 Other 400,831 309,537 203,803 91,294 29.5 105,734 51.9 Total revenues $ 2,816,304 $ 2,135,577 $ 1,424,267 $ 680,727 31.9 % $ 711,310 49.9 % Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 439,055 $ 355,696 $ 254,115 $ 83,359 23.4 % $ 101,581 40.0 % Healthcare 270,790 199,791 135,374 70,999 35.5 64,417 47.6 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 136,609 108,480 73,443 28,129 25.9 35,037 47.7 Other 132,209 111,319 63,657 20,890 18.8 47,662 74.9 Total segment operating profit $ 978,663 $ 775,286 $ 526,589 $ 203,377 26.2 % $ 248,697 47.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 28.2%, or approximately $282.6 million, from approximately $1,001.4 million during 2007 to approximately $1,284.0 million in 2008. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new 50 Table of Contents customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 and customers added since such date was approximately $263.1 million and approximately $19.5 million, respectively. Within the segment, full year revenue from our banking customers increased approximately $202.1 million over the prior year. However, our quarterly sequential revenue decreased in the latter portion of 2008 and we expect this trend to continue into 2009 due to the continuing crisis in the financial services sector. Overall, the full year 2008 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 23.4%, or approximately $83.4 million, from approximately $355.7 million during 2007 to approximately $439.1 million during 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $762.6 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; (v) stock repurchases; and (vi) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2008, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $1,080.5 million as compared to working capital of approximately $901.5 million as of December 31, 2007. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $429.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in 2008 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2008. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $259.2 million at December 31, 2006 to approximately $383.0 million at December 31, 2007 and to approximately $517.5 million at December 31, 2008. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $39.3 million at December 31, 2006 to approximately $53.5 at December 31, 2007 and to approximately $62.2 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2008 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of 53 Table of Contents accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2008, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 71 days as compared to 67 days as of December 31, 2007 and 65 days as of December 31, 2006. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2008 primarily relates to decreased payments for acquisitions and the net effect of the sale of a portion of our auction rate securities investments and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds into cash and cash equivalents during the year. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributed to greater investment to expand our offshore IT development centers and to payments for the acquisitions, partially offset by higher net cash flows generated from maturities or sales of investments. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in 2008 relates primarily to lower Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and lower proceeds and excess tax benefits from exercises of employee stock options. The decrease in 2007 relates primarily to Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, offset, in part, by higher proceeds and excess tax benefits from exercises of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2008, our short term and long term investments totaled $189.2 million and included $5.9 million in short term and $133.5 million in long term of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $28.2 million of an auction rate securities related UBS Right discussed below. Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2008. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS to sell to UBS, at par value ($168.5 million), our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. We elected to measure the UBS Right under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 and recorded pre tax income of $28.2 million, and a corresponding long term investment. At the same time, we transferred our investment in auction rate securities from available for sale securities to trading securities. As a result of this transfer, we recognized a pre tax loss of $29.1 million reflecting the reversal to income of the unrealized loss previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. These transactions were recorded in the caption other income (expense), net in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. If a liquidity event does not occur prior to the exercise period under the UBS Right, we expect to obtain liquidity through the UBS Right. If UBS is unable to honor its obligations under the UBS Right, we believe we will be able to ultimately recover our investment in auction rate municipal debt securities due to: (i) the strength of the underlying collateral, substantially backed by FFELP, and (ii) the AAA credit rating of the securities held by us. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security (up to 33 years) to realize our investments recorded value. 54 Table of Contents Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. Commitments and Contingencies Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $55.3 million related to our India development center expansion program. During December 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchased $50.0 million of our Class A common stock. This authorization expires in December 2009 and we have not purchased any shares in 2008 under this program. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 222,516 $ 55,435 $ 97,693 $ 59,090 $ 10,298 Fixed capital commitments(1) 55,312 55,312 Other purchase commitments(2) 57,475 44,296 13,179 Total $ 335,303 $ 155,043 $ 110,872 $ 59,090 $ 10,298 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. In connection with a 2008 acquisition, additional purchase price not to exceed $14.0 million, payable in 2010, is contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial and operating targets during an earn out period. We will fund such payment, if any, from operating cash flow. Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The ultimate amount payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because the amount is dependent on future results of operations of the acquired business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not recorded a liability for this item on our balance sheet because the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. As of December 31, 2008, we had $6.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. 55 Table of Contents We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 79.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 are generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 29.6% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2008, are denominated in the Indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2008, we reported foreign currency losses of approximately $22.8 million, which are primarily attributed to the remeasurement of (i) U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and (ii) Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiaries. During December 2008, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2008, the notional value of these contracts is $82.0 million and are scheduled to mature during the first quarter of 2009. In January 2009, we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of $268.0 million. These contracts are scheduled to mature over the remainder of 2009. There were no other off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2008, 2007 and 2006 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services we offer has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. We have experienced wage 56 Table of Contents inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20.0% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measures; however, the application of this statement may change current practice. SFAS No. 157 does not apply to fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) decided that an entity need not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until 2009. Accordingly, our adoption of this standard in 2008 was limited to financial assets and liabilities, which primarily affects the valuation of our investments and derivative contracts. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We do not believe the full adoption of SFAS No. 157 with respect to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 primarily include those measured at fair value in impairment testing and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157 3), which addresses the application of SFAS No. 157 for illiquid financial instruments. The adoption of FSP FAS 157 3 did not change our valuation methodology or have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which is effective for financial statements beginning January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 and have elected the fair value option for our UBS Right as detailed in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and 57 Table of Contents distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any noncontrolling interests in other entities. Accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 161 in 2009. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and may use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. During December 2008, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2008, the notional value of these contracts is $82.0 million and are scheduled to mature during the first quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008 the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $0.6 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2008, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, 58 Table of Contents a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $8.0 million. In January 2009, we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of $268.0 million. These contracts are scheduled to mature over the remainder of 2009. There were no other off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2008, 2007 and 2006 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $924.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily in AAA/Aaa rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. As of December 31, 2008, our short term and long term investments totaled $189.2 million and included $5.9 million in short term and $133.5 million in long term of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $28.2 million of an auction rate related UBS Right discussed below. Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2008. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS to sell to UBS, at par value ($168.5 million), our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. We elected to measure the UBS Right under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 and recorded pre tax income of $28.2 million, and a corresponding long term investment. At the same time, we transferred our investment in auction rate securities from available for sale securities to trading securities. As a result of this transfer, we recognized a pre tax loss on our consolidated statement of operations of $29.1 million reflecting the reversal of the unrealized loss previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2008, our revenues increased to $2,816.3 million compared to $2,135.6 million in 2007. Net income increased to $430.8 million or $1.44 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.15 per diluted share during 2008. This is compared to $350.1 million or $1.15 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.12 per diluted share during 2007. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2008 were as follows: strong performance across all our business segments, each of which had year over year revenue growth equal to or greater than 28.2%; greater penetration of the European market, where we experienced revenue growth of 57.8% in 2008 as compared to 2007; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, particularly high performance web development initiatives and complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 565 active clients compared to approximately 500 as of December 31, 2007 and increased the number of strategic clients by 21 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 128. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 19.4% and 30.0%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2008 as compared to 23.9% and 34.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. In Europe, we continue to experience solid growth. During 2008, our revenue from European customers increased by 57.8% to $541.1 million compared to $342.9 million in 2007. In 2008, revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by $91.3 million from $121.8 million in 2007 to $213.1 million. Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us in 2009 as we see this region and the Asia Pacific region, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports state that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach an estimated $47 billion by the end of the fiscal year March 31, 2009. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 16% to 17% over the prior fiscal year. In 2008, our operating margin increased to 18.3% compared to 17.9% in 2007. Excluding stock based compensation costs of $43.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $8.1 million, operating margin in 2008 was 20.2%. This was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of our revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation costs. Historically, we have 40 Table of Contents invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings; (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities; (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For 2009, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business. During 2008, we experienced slower than initially expected revenue growth primarily due to the slowing global economy and softness in the financial services sector. This along with the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar during the first half of 2008 and continuing wage inflation, primarily in India, put pressure on our operating margins. In response, we implemented actions during the year that mitigated these negative market trends, including increasing the global utilization rates of our technical staff and reducing discretionary spending. In the second half of 2008, we benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar, which favorably impacted our full year over year operating margin by approximately 119 basis points or 1.19 percent. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 25 basis points or 0.25 percentage points. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 61,700, an increase of approximately 6,300 over the prior year. The increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2008. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 14.2% for 2008. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20% of our total operating expenses. Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million through the end of the program on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. During 2009, we expect to spend approximately $175 million globally for capital expenditures, a portion of which relates to our India real estate development program. At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $762.6 million and working capital of approximately $1,080.5 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2008, we repurchased $27.8 million of our Class A common stock under a stock repurchase program that expired in September 2008. Stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital. On December 3, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized a $50.0 million stock repurchase program, which expires in December 2009 and has similar terms to the previous program. No shares were repurchased under this program in December 2008. During 2009, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Slowing global economy, particularly weakness in the United States and the United Kingdom; Continued weakness in the financial services sector; Pressure on customer IT budgets, which may result in delays or decreases in spending by customers on discretionary projects, specifically application development projects. However, we expect a focus by customers 41 Table of Contents on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; and Foreign currency volatility. In response to this challenging macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Partner with our existing customers to see where we can provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Expand our BPO and infrastructure management practices, which are in high demand in this challenging business environment; Continue to aggressively increase our customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that can improve our overall service delivery capabilities; and Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed priced contracts, are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial. 42 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock, the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and, beginning in 2007, due to a recent tax law change in India, the expected exercise proceeds for stock based awards subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax. In addition, for stock performance units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of SFAS No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries (collectively, Cognizant India) are export oriented companies, which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park (STP) with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. Under current law, these tax holidays will be completely phased out by March 2010. In anticipation of the complete phase out of these tax holidays in March 2010, we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Development centers operating in SEZs will be entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. Under current Indian tax law, export profits after March 31, 2010 from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.99% as of December 31, 2008) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively 43 Table of Contents extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2010, we expect that our effective income tax rate would increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2010. Investments. Historically, our investments have been in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process, corporate notes and bonds, U.S. government agencies, bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria. We evaluate our available for sale investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our available for sale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. Determining the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity requires judgment, including determining the appropriate holding period and discount rate to be used in valuing such securities. We value our investment in auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates the following key inputs: (i) the underlying structure of each security; (ii) frequency and amounts of cash flows; (iii) expected holding period for the security; and (iv) discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security. In estimating the holding period, we considered the current developments in the auction rate market including: our ability to hold the securities for such period of time, recent calls of auction rate securities by issuers and the possible reestablishment of an active market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Based upon these factors, we used a holding period of five years for securities with a stated maturity beyond five years, which represents the period of time we anticipate will elapse before a liquidity event will occur. An increase or decrease in the holding period by two years would change the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $10.0 million. We derive the discount rate by considering observable interest rate yields for bonds supported by student loans and pricing of new bond issuances, and adding an illiquidity premium to such rates. The illiquidity premium was estimated by management considering current market conditions. As of December 31, 2008, we used a weighted average illiquidity premium of 140 basis points. This weighted average illiquidity premium has been impacted by overall issues within the credit and capital markets and related increases in volatility including uncertainty of the credit and money markets. An increase or decrease to the illiquidity premium of 100 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $6.0 million. Our valuation is also impacted by changes in market interest rates because the interest payments we receive on our auction rate securities vary based on a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. An increase or decrease in market interest rates of 50 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $9.0 million. We anticipate there will be ongoing developments in the credit markets and the market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Accordingly, our estimates of the expected holding period and illiquidity premium used in valuing such securities are reasonably likely to change in the short term. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2008, our goodwill balance was $154.0 million. Long Lived Assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever 44 Table of Contents events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our IT development centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with reasonable assurance regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2008: (Dollars in thousands) 2008 % ofRevenues 2007 % ofRevenues 2006 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 Revenues $ 2,816,304 100.0 % $ 2,135,577 100.0 % $ 1,424,267 100.0 % $ 680,727 $ 711,310 Cost of revenues(1) 1,572,816 55.8 1,206,035 56.5 787,923 55.3 366,781 418,112 Selling, general and administrative(2) 652,021 23.2 494,102 23.1 343,238 24.1 157,919 150,864 Depreciation and amortization 74,797 2.7 53,918 2.5 34,163 2.4 20,879 19,755 Income from operations 516,670 18.3 % 381,522 17.9 % 258,943 18.2 % 135,148 122,579 Other income (expense), net (1,460 ) 32,834 18,868 (34,294 ) 13,966 Provision for income taxes 84,365 64,223 45,016 20,142 19,207 Net income $ 430,845 15.3 % $ 350,133 16.4 % $ 232,795 16.3 % $ 80,712 $ 117,338 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $18,715, $17,206 and $13,400 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $2,731 and $1,979 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $25,185, $18,710 and $16,534 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5,418 and $3,943 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. 45 Table of Contents The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under SFAS No. 123R, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense that are recurring. Stock based compensation and the related Indian fringe benefit tax expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2008 % ofRevenues 2007 % ofRevenues 2006 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 516,670 18.3 % $ 381,522 17.9 % $ 258,943 18.2 % Add: stock based compensation expense 43,900 1.6 35,916 1.7 29,934 2.1 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 8,149 0.3 5,922 0.2 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 568,719 20.2 % $ 423,360 19.8 % $ 288,877 20.3 % Effective April 1, 2007, a new fringe benefit tax was introduced in India that obligates us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the 46 Table of Contents appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There is no cash cost to us as we recover the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. Our future operating results may experience volatility as a result of the timing of exercise or distribution of shares related to stock based compensation awards to our employees who worked or are working in India. The amount of stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense recorded during 2008 and 2007 was $8.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenue. Revenue increased by 31.9%, or approximately $680.7 million, from approximately $2,135.6 million during 2007 to approximately $2,816.3 million in 2008. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the on site/offshore delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 increased by approximately $550.3 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2007 was approximately $130.4 million or approximately 4.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2008 increased by $198.3 million as compared to 2007. We had approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008 as compared to approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $282.6 million and $183.7 million, respectively, of the $680.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 28.0% and 35.5%, respectively, compared to 2007 and represented approximately 46.9% and 53.1%, respectively, of total revenues in 2008. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 30.4% or $366.8 million from $1,206.0 million during 2007 to $1,572.8 million in 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $326.0 million, which is primarily attributed to the increase in the number of our technical personnel. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.6%, or $178.8 million, from $548.0 million during 2007 to $726.8 million during 2008, and increased slightly as a percentage of revenue from 25.7% in 2007 to 25.8% in 2008. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 35.4%, or $135.2 million, from approximately $381.5 million during 2007 to approximately $516.7 million during 2008, representing operating margins of approximately 18.3% of revenues in 2008 and 17.9% of revenues in 2007. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to increased revenues, achieving operating efficiencies including leverage on prior sales and marketing investments and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $52.0 million in 2008 and $41.8 million in 2007, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 20.2% and 19.8%, respectively. 47 Table of Contents Other Income/(Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net decreased from $32.8 million of income in 2007 to $1.5 million of expense in 2008 or by $34.3 million and consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. This $34.3 million decrease is attributed to a period over period decrease of $26.0 million in foreign currency income attributed to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, euro and Indian rupee, and a reduction of $7.4 million in interest income, from approximately $29.6 million in 2007 to $22.2 million in 2008. In 2008, foreign currency losses were approximately $22.8 million, which are primarily attributed to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower average short term interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $64.2 million in 2007 to approximately $84.4 million in 2008. The effective income tax rate increased from 15.5% in 2007 to 16.4% in 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate is primarily attributed to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007 resulting from the settlement of and expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax provisions and, in 2008, a net return to provision adjustment of $2.4 million. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 15.9% for 2008 compared to 16.4% for 2007. This decrease was primarily due to our overall growth, which resulted in a greater percentage of Cognizant Indias revenues falling under the income tax holiday, growth in countries whose tax rates are lower than the United States and net reductions in statutory income tax rates, primarily in Europe. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $350.1 million in 2007 to approximately $430.8 million in 2008, representing 16.4% and 15.3% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2008 is primarily attributed to the decrease in interest income and the foreign currency losses in 2008, partially offset by a higher operating margin in 2008. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Revenue. Revenue increased by 49.9%, or approximately $711.3 million, from approximately $1,424.3 million during 2006 to approximately $2,135.6 million in 2007. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the on site/offshore delivery model among an increasing number of industries, strength in our customers discretionary spending and penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 increased by approximately $630.4 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2006 was approximately $80.9 million or approximately 3.8% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2007 increased by $159.0 million as compared to 2006. We had approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007 as compared to approximately 400 active clients as of December 31, 2006. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services with all of our business segments experiencing year over year revenue growth between 47.3% and 52.7%. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $321.5 million and $173.6 million, respectively, of the $711.3 million increase in revenue. Our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 48.4% and 51.4%, respectively, compared to 2006 and represented approximately 48.4% and 51.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2007. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consisted primarily of the cost of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, the cost of subcontracting, and the cost of sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by 53.1% or approximately $418.1 million, from approximately $787.9 million during 2006 to approximately $1,206.0 million in 2007. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $381.9 million. 48 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by 45.2%, or approximately $170.6 million, from approximately $377.4 million during 2006 to approximately $548.0 million during 2007, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from approximately 26.5% in 2006 to approximately 25.7% in 2007. The percentage decrease was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending, partially offset by the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased 47.3%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $258.9 million during 2006 to approximately $381.5 million during 2007, representing operating margins of approximately 17.9% of revenues in 2007 and 18.2% of revenues in 2006. The decrease in operating margin was due primarily to appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and wage inflation, primarily in India, partially offset by cost containment actions such as control of discretionary spending and scale efficiencies, including increased utilization rates of our technical staff, and lower stock compensation costs as a percentage of revenues. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $35.9 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $5.9 million in 2007 and stock based compensation expense of $29.9 million in 2006, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were 19.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Other Income/(Expense), Net. Other income/(expense), net consisted primarily of interest income and foreign currency gains or losses. The increase in other income/(expense), net of $14.0 million was attributed to an increase in interest income of $12.0 million from approximately $17.6 million in 2006 to approximately $29.6 million in 2007 and a year over year increase of approximately $2.0 million in income due to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in interest income was due to higher invested global cash balances and an increase in short term interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $45.0 million in 2006 to approximately $64.2 million in 2007. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.2% in 2006 to 15.5% in 2007 primarily due to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007, including $2.9 million upon the expiration of the U.S. federal income tax statute of limitations for previously recorded uncertain income tax positions and a net benefit of $0.7 million attributed to the effective settlement of certain foreign income tax positions. Additionally, the effective income tax rate decreased due to net reductions in statutory income tax rates. Excluding discrete items, the Companys effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007 was 16.4%. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $232.8 million in 2006 to approximately $350.1 million in 2007, representing 16.3% and 16.4% of revenues in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. 49 Table of Contents Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based India fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and are adjusted only against the total income from operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 565 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are as follows: 2008 2007 2008 2007 2006 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,284,013 $ 1,001,420 $ 679,901 $ 282,593 28.2 % $ 321,519 47.3 % Healthcare 688,224 504,504 330,860 183,720 36.4 173,644 52.5 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 443,236 320,116 209,703 123,120 38.5 110,413 52.7 Other 400,831 309,537 203,803 91,294 29.5 105,734 51.9 Total revenues $ 2,816,304 $ 2,135,577 $ 1,424,267 $ 680,727 31.9 % $ 711,310 49.9 % Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 439,055 $ 355,696 $ 254,115 $ 83,359 23.4 % $ 101,581 40.0 % Healthcare 270,790 199,791 135,374 70,999 35.5 64,417 47.6 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 136,609 108,480 73,443 28,129 25.9 35,037 47.7 Other 132,209 111,319 63,657 20,890 18.8 47,662 74.9 Total segment operating profit $ 978,663 $ 775,286 $ 526,589 $ 203,377 26.2 % $ 248,697 47.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 28.2%, or approximately $282.6 million, from approximately $1,001.4 million during 2007 to approximately $1,284.0 million in 2008. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new 50 Table of Contents customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 and customers added since such date was approximately $263.1 million and approximately $19.5 million, respectively. Within the segment, full year revenue from our banking customers increased approximately $202.1 million over the prior year. However, our quarterly sequential revenue decreased in the latter portion of 2008 and we expect this trend to continue into 2009 due to the continuing crisis in the financial services sector. Overall, the full year 2008 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 23.4%, or approximately $83.4 million, from approximately $355.7 million during 2007 to approximately $439.1 million during 2008. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing and wage inflation, primarily in India. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 36.4%, or approximately $183.7 million, from approximately $504.5 million during 2007 to approximately $688.2 million in 2008.

The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 and customers added since such date was approximately $166.3 million and approximately $17.4 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our life sciences customers, where revenue increased by approximately $121.3 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 35.5%, or approximately $71.0 million, from approximately $199.8 million during 2007 to approximately $270.8 million during 2008.

The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 and customers added since such date was approximately $77.3 million and approximately $45.8 million, respectively. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 25.9%, or approximately $28.1 million, from approximately $108.5 million during 2007 to approximately $136.6 million during 2008. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing and wage inflation, primarily in India. Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 29.5%, or approximately $91.3 million, from approximately $309.5 million in 2007 to approximately $400.8 million in 2008. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in 51 Table of Contents revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 and customers added since such date was approximately $43.6 million and approximately $47.7 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our high technology customers, where revenue increased approximately $40.1 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 18.8%, or approximately $20.9 million from approximately $111.3 million in 2007 to approximately $132.2 million in 2008.

Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 47.3%, or approximately $321.5 million, from approximately $679.9 million during 2006 to approximately $1,001.4 million in 2007. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 and customers added since such date was approximately $301.5 million and approximately $20.0 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our banking customers, where revenue increased approximately $253.9 million over the prior year including significant growth from our European banking clients, which accounted for 28.9% of the segment growth over the prior year. The business challenges experienced by the financial services industry during the last six months of 2007 did not have material impact on our business. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 40.0%, or approximately $101.6 million, from approximately $254.1 million during 2006 to approximately $355.7 million during 2007. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing, the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee and wage inflation, primarily in India. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 52.5%, or approximately $173.6 million, from approximately $330.9 million during 2006 to approximately $504.5 million in 2007. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 and customers added since such date was approximately $157.6 million and approximately $16.0 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our healthcare customers, where revenue increased by approximately $88.9 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 47.6%, or approximately $64.4 million, from approximately $135.4 million during 2006 to approximately $199.8 million during 2007. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing, the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee and wage inflation, primarily in India. 52 Table of Contents Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 52.7%, or approximately $110.4 million, from approximately $209.7 million during 2006 to approximately $320.1 million in 2007. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2006 and customers added since such date was approximately $83.5 million and approximately $26.9 million, respectively. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the on site/offshore IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 47.7%, or approximately $35.1 million, from approximately $73.4 million during 2006 to approximately $108.5 million during 2007. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing, the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee and wage inflation, primarily in India.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $762.6 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore IT development centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) possible acquisitions of related businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; (v) stock repurchases; and (vi) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2008, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $1,080.5 million as compared to working capital of approximately $901.5 million as of December 31, 2007. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $429.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $252.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in 2008 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2008. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $259.2 million at December 31, 2006 to approximately $383.0 million at December 31, 2007 and to approximately $517.5 million at December 31, 2008. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $39.3 million at December 31, 2006 to approximately $53.5 at December 31, 2007 and to approximately $62.2 million at December 31, 2008. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2008 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of 53 Table of Contents accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2008, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 71 days as compared to 67 days as of December 31, 2007 and 65 days as of December 31, 2006. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $272.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2008 primarily relates to decreased payments for acquisitions and the net effect of the sale of a portion of our auction rate securities investments and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds into cash and cash equivalents during the year. The increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily attributed to greater investment to expand our offshore IT development centers and to payments for the acquisitions, partially offset by higher net cash flows generated from maturities or sales of investments. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $82.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in 2008 relates primarily to lower Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and lower proceeds and excess tax benefits from exercises of employee stock options. The decrease in 2007 relates primarily to Class A common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program, offset, in part, by higher proceeds and excess tax benefits from exercises of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2008, our short term and long term investments totaled $189.2 million and included $5.9 million in short term and $133.5 million in long term of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $28.2 million of an auction rate securities related UBS Right discussed below. Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2008. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS to sell to UBS, at par value ($168.5 million), our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. We elected to measure the UBS Right under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 and recorded pre tax income of $28.2 million, and a corresponding long term investment. At the same time, we transferred our investment in auction rate securities from available for sale securities to trading securities. As a result of this transfer, we recognized a pre tax loss of $29.1 million reflecting the reversal to income of the unrealized loss previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. These transactions were recorded in the caption other income (expense), net in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. If a liquidity event does not occur prior to the exercise period under the UBS Right, we expect to obtain liquidity through the UBS Right. If UBS is unable to honor its obligations under the UBS Right, we believe we will be able to ultimately recover our investment in auction rate municipal debt securities due to: (i) the strength of the underlying collateral, substantially backed by FFELP, and (ii) the AAA credit rating of the securities held by us. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security (up to 33 years) to realize our investments recorded value. 54 Table of Contents Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. Commitments and Contingencies Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $55.3 million related to our India development center expansion program. During December 2008, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchased $50.0 million of our Class A common stock. This authorization expires in December 2009 and we have not purchased any shares in 2008 under this program. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2008, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 222,516 $ 55,435 $ 97,693 $ 59,090 $ 10,298 Fixed capital commitments(1) 55,312 55,312 Other purchase commitments(2) 57,475 44,296 13,179 Total $ 335,303 $ 155,043 $ 110,872 $ 59,090 $ 10,298 (1) Relates to India IT development center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. In connection with a 2008 acquisition, additional purchase price not to exceed $14.0 million, payable in 2010, is contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial and operating targets during an earn out period. We will fund such payment, if any, from operating cash flow. Contingent purchase price payments relating to acquisitions are recorded when the contingencies are resolved. The ultimate amount payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because the amount is dependent on future results of operations of the acquired business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not recorded a liability for this item on our balance sheet because the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. As of December 31, 2008, we had $6.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. 55 Table of Contents We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers computer system could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our application design, development and maintenance services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign exchange rates as approximately 79.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 are generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 29.6% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2008, are denominated in the Indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2008, we reported foreign currency losses of approximately $22.8 million, which are primarily attributed to the remeasurement of (i) U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and (ii) Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiaries. During December 2008, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2008, the notional value of these contracts is $82.0 million and are scheduled to mature during the first quarter of 2009. In January 2009, we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of $268.0 million. These contracts are scheduled to mature over the remainder of 2009. There were no other off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2008, 2007 and 2006 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services we offer has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other IT service providers, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. We have experienced wage 56 Table of Contents inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20.0% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 157 does not expand or require any new fair value measures; however, the application of this statement may change current practice. SFAS No. 157 does not apply to fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases. In February 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) decided that an entity need not apply this standard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until 2009. Accordingly, our adoption of this standard in 2008 was limited to financial assets and liabilities, which primarily affects the valuation of our investments and derivative contracts. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We do not believe the full adoption of SFAS No. 157 with respect to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 primarily include those measured at fair value in impairment testing and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157 3), which addresses the application of SFAS No. 157 for illiquid financial instruments. The adoption of FSP FAS 157 3 did not change our valuation methodology or have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159), which is effective for financial statements beginning January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to measure eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value, on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159 and have elected the fair value option for our UBS Right as detailed in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and 57 Table of Contents distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any noncontrolling interests in other entities. Accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133). SFAS No. 161 requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No. 133 and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. We will adopt SFAS No. 161 in 2009. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations and may use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. During December 2008, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2008, the notional value of these contracts is $82.0 million and are scheduled to mature during the first quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008 the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $0.6 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2008, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, 58 Table of Contents a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $8.0 million. In January 2009, we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts with a notional value of $268.0 million. These contracts are scheduled to mature over the remainder of 2009. There were no other off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2008, 2007 and 2006 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $924.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily in AAA/Aaa rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. As of December 31, 2008, our short term and long term investments totaled $189.2 million and included $5.9 million in short term and $133.5 million in long term of AAA rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $28.2 million of an auction rate related UBS Right discussed below. Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2008. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS to sell to UBS, at par value ($168.5 million), our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. We elected to measure the UBS Right under the fair value option of SFAS No. 159 and recorded pre tax income of $28.2 million, and a corresponding long term investment. At the same time, we transferred our investment in auction rate securities from available for sale securities to trading securities. As a result of this transfer, we recognized a pre tax loss on our consolidated statement of operations of $29.1 million reflecting the reversal of the unrealized loss previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.
