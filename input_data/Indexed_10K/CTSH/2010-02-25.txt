For additional information, refer to Note 12 (Stock Based Compensation Plans) to our consolidated financial statements. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2005, our consolidated statement of operations data includes the reduction of income tax expense (one time income tax benefit) of $12,411, $0.05 per basic earnings per share and $0.04 per diluted earnings per share related to the repatriation of $60,000 of Indian earnings pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. 42 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2009, our revenues increased to $3,278.7 million compared to $2,816.3 million in 2008. Net income increased to $535.0 million or $1.78 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.12 per diluted share during 2009. This is compared to $430.8 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.15 per diluted share during 2008. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2009 were as follows: strong performance within our Healthcare and Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics business segments, each of which had revenue growth equal to or greater than 25.0%; strong performance in North America where we experienced revenue growth of 16.4% in 2009 as compared to 2008; continued penetration of the European market where we experienced revenue growth of 12.1%, and success with our recent entry in the Asian markets where we grew by 65.9%, in 2009 as compared to 2008; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, including application maintenance, complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 589 active clients compared to approximately 565 as of December 31, 2008 and increased the number of strategic clients by 16 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 144. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 17.4% and 29.4%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2009 as compared to 19.4% and 30.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2008. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. Our revenue from European customers increased by 12.1% to approximately $606.8 million in 2009 compared to approximately $541.1 million in 2008. Our operation in the United Kingdom, or UK reported a 7.8% increase in revenue to approximately $353.5 million in 2009, as compared to approximately $328.0 million in 2008. This increase is primarily attributed to growth from existing and new customers in our Healthcare and Manufacturing /Retail/Logistics business segments and was offset by year over year unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates which negatively impacted revenue in 2009 by approximately $50.1 million. Revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately 18.9% to approximately $253.3 million in 2009 from approximately $213.1 million in 2008. We believe that Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region and the Asia Pacific region, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports state that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach almost $50 billion by the end of NASSCOMs fiscal year March 31, 2010. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 5.5% over the prior fiscal year. Additionally, the FY 2010 11 Outlook for these sectors expects revenue growth of 13% to 15%. According to the latest NASSCOM Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India report, global changes and new 43 Table of Contents megatrends within economic, demographic, business, social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of $175 billion by 2020. In 2009, our operating margin increased to 18.9% compared to 18.3% in 2008. Excluding stock based compensation costs of $44.8 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million, operating margin in 2009 was 20.3%. This was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of our revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings; (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities; (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For the year ending December 31, 2010, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 78,400, an increase of approximately 16,700 over the prior year. The increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2009. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 10.3% for 2009. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20% of our total operating expenses. Our current India real estate development program includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million through the end of the program on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. During 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million globally for capital expenditures. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $1,399.3 million and working capital of approximately $1,661.0 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2009, we repurchased $12.4 million of our Class A common stock under a stock repurchase program that expired in December 2009. Stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital. While several measures have indicated that the economy may be improving, the economic environment remains fragile. During 2010, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Stabilization of global economic conditions and the financial services sector; Normalization of customer IT budgets, which may result in spending by customers on discretionary projects, specifically application development projects. In addition, we expect a continued focus by 44 Table of Contents customers on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; Industry consolidation, which will drive demand for integration services; Secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes; and Foreign currency volatility. In response to this challenging macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings; Partner with our existing customers to see where we can provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Expand our BPO and infrastructure management practices, which are in high demand in this challenging business environment; Continue to aggressively increase our customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that can improve our overall service delivery capabilities; and Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed price contracts, are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first 45 Table of Contents becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial. Stock Based Compensation. Utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock, the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and the expected exercise proceeds for stock based awards subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax, if applicable. In addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively herein as Cognizant India, are export oriented companies which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park, or STPs, with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. In August 2009, the tax holidays for STPs were extended by one year and are currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2011. Thereafter, export profits from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.99% as of December 31, 2009) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2011, we expect that our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011. In addition, we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs. Development centers operating in SEZs are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. 46 Table of Contents Investments. Historically, our investments have been in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process, corporate notes and bonds, debt issuances by U.S. government agencies, bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria. We evaluate our available for sale investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our available for sale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. Determining the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity requires judgment, including determining the appropriate holding period and discount rate to be used in valuing such securities. We value our investment in auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates the following key inputs: (i) the underlying structure of each security; (ii) frequency and amounts of cash flows; (iii) expected holding period for the security; and (iv) discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security. In estimating the holding period, we considered the current developments in the auction rate market including: our ability to hold the securities for such period of time, recent calls of auction rate securities by issuers and the possible reestablishment of an active market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Based upon these factors, we used a holding period of five years for securities with a stated maturity beyond five years, which represents the period of time we anticipate will elapse before a liquidity event could occur. An increase or decrease in the holding period by two years would change the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $8.0 million. We derive the discount rate by considering observable interest rate yields for bonds supported by student loans and pricing of new bond issuances, and adding an illiquidity premium to such rates. The illiquidity premium was estimated by management considering current market conditions. As of December 31, 2009, we used a weighted average illiquidity premium of 290 basis points. This weighted average illiquidity premium has been impacted by overall issues within the credit and capital markets and related increases in volatility including uncertainty of the credit and money markets. An increase or decrease to the illiquidity premium of 100 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $6.0 million. Our valuation is also impacted by changes in market interest rates because the interest payments we receive on our auction rate securities vary based on a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. An increase or decrease in market interest rates of 25 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $5.0 million. We anticipate there will be ongoing developments in the credit markets and the market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Accordingly, our estimates of the expected holding period and illiquidity premium used in valuing such securities may change in the short term. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2009, our goodwill balance was $192.4 million. Long Lived Assets. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future 47 Table of Contents cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our development and delivery centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with reasonable assurance regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.

(2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $29,927, $25,185 and $18,710 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $758, $5,418 and $3,943 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. 48 Table of Contents The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stock based compensation expense, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation that is recurring and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense that was repealed during the third quarter of 2009, retroactive to April 1, 2009. Stock based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues 2007 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 618,490 18.9 % $ 516,670 18.3 % $ 381,522 17.9 % Add: stock based compensation expense 44,816 1.4 43,900 1.6 35,916 1.7 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 945 8,149 0.3 5,922 0.2 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 664,251 20.3 % $ 568,719 20.2 % $ 423,360 19.8 % The fringe benefit tax regulation in India obligated us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to 49 Table of Contents date of vest. There was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. During the third quarter of 2009, the Indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to April 1, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenue. Revenue increased by 16.4%, or approximately $462.4 million, from approximately $2,816.3 million during 2008 to approximately $3,278.7 million in 2009. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 increased by approximately $375.9 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2008 was approximately $86.5 million or approximately 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2009 by $365.9 million and $65.7 million, respectively, as compared to 2008. We had approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009 as compared to approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $122.6 million and $172.2 million, respectively, of the $462.4 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 10.2% and 21.9%, respectively, compared to 2008 and represented approximately 44.4% and 55.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2009. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 17.6% or $276.6 million from $1,572.8 million during 2008 to $1,849.4 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $267.1 million, inclusive of the depreciation of the Indian rupee, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel, and incentive based compensation, offset by continued improvements in operating efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 11.5% or $83.9 million, from $726.8 million during 2008, to $810.7 million during 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 25.8% in 2008 to 24.7% in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 19.7%, or $101.8 million, from approximately $516.7 million during 2008 to approximately $618.5 million during 2009, representing operating margins of approximately 18.9% of revenues in 2009 and 18.3% of revenues in 2008. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially 50 Table of Contents offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 255 basis points or 2.55 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 24 basis points or 0.24 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $45.8 million in 2009 and $52.0 million in 2008, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 20.3% and 20.2%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2009, these cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) $ 22,493 $ (22,818 ) $ 45,311 Gains (losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (20,821 ) (20,821 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 1,672 (22,818 ) 24,490 Interest income 15,895 22,188 (6,293 ) Other income (expense), net 894 (830 ) 1,724 Total other income (expense), net $ 18,461 $ (1,460 ) $ 19,921 The foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $22.5 million were primarily attributed to (i) U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and (ii) the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $20.8 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $400.0 million. The $6.3 million decrease in interest income was due to lower average short term interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in other income (expense), net of $1.7 million primarily relates to gains on redemptions of certain auction rate securities offset by the net change in fair value of our auction rate securities and the related UBS Right. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $84.4 million in 2008 to approximately $102.0 million in 2009. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.4% in 2008 to 16.0% in 2009. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the tax impact of foreign exchange forward contracts, as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our income which resulted in a greater percentage of our revenues falling under income tax holidays. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $430.8 million in 2008 to approximately $535.0 million in 2009, representing 15.3% and 16.3% of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2009 is primarily attributed to a higher operating margin and foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest income. 51 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenue. Revenue increased by 31.9%, or approximately $680.7 million, from approximately $2,135.6 million during 2007 to approximately $2,816.3 million in 2008. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 increased by approximately $550.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2008 was approximately $130.4 million or approximately 4.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2008 increased by $198.3 million as compared to 2007. We had approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008 as compared to approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $282.6 million and $183.7 million, respectively, of the $680.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 28.0% and 35.5%, respectively, compared to 2007 and represented approximately 46.9% and 53.1%, respectively, of total revenues in 2008. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 30.4%, or $366.8 million, from $1,206.0 million during 2007 to $1,572.8 million in 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $326.0 million, which is primarily attributed to the increase in the number of our technical personnel. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.6%, or $178.8 million, from $548.0 million during 2007 to $726.8 million during 2008, and increased slightly as a percentage of revenue from 25.7% in 2007 to 25.8% in 2008. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 35.4%, or $135.2 million, from approximately $381.5 million during 2007 to approximately $516.7 million during 2008, representing operating margins of approximately 18.3% of revenues in 2008 and 17.9% of revenues in 2007. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to increased revenues, achieving operating efficiencies including leverage on prior sales and marketing investments and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $52.0 million in 2008 and $41.8 million in 2007, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 20.2% and 19.8%, respectively. Other Income/(Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net decreased from $32.8 million of income in 2007 to $1.5 million of expense in 2008, or by $34.3 million, and consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. This $34.3 million decrease is attributed to a period over period decrease of $26.0 million in foreign currency exchange income attributed to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, Euro and Indian rupee, and a reduction of $7.4 million in interest income, from approximately $29.6 million in 2007 to $22.2 million in 2008. In 2008, foreign currency exchange losses were approximately $22.8 million, which are primarily attributed to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our 52 Table of Contents European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower average short term interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $64.2 million in 2007 to approximately $84.4 million in 2008. The effective income tax rate increased from 15.5% in 2007 to 16.4% in 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007 resulting from the settlement of and expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax provisions and, in 2008, a net return to provision adjustment of $2.4 million. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 15.9% for 2008 compared to 16.4% for 2007. This decrease was primarily due to our overall growth, which resulted in a greater percentage of Cognizant Indias revenues falling under the income tax holiday, growth in countries whose tax rates were lower than the United States and net reductions in statutory income tax rates, primarily in Europe. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $350.1 million in 2007 to approximately $430.8 million in 2008, representing 16.4% and 15.3% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2008 was primarily attributed to the decrease in interest income and the foreign currency losses in 2008, partially offset by a higher operating margin in 2008. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes entertainment, media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed in Note 14 as unallocated and are adjusted only against the total income from operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 589 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. 53 Table of Contents Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: 2009 2008 2009 2008 2007 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,406,629 $ 1,284,013 $ 1,001,420 $ 122,616 9.5 % $ 282,593 28.2 % Healthcare 860,427 688,224 504,504 172,203 25.0 183,720 36.4 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 564,917 443,236 320,116 121,681 27.5 123,120 38.5 Other 446,690 400,831 309,537 45,859 11.4 91,294 29.5 Total revenues $ 3,278,663 $ 2,816,304 $ 2,135,577 $ 462,359 16.4 % $ 680,727 31.9 % Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 503,689 $ 439,055 $ 355,696 $ 64,634 14.7 % $ 83,359 23.4 % Healthcare 331,007 270,790 199,791 60,217 22.2 70,999 35.5 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 184,636 136,609 108,480 48,027 35.2 28,129 25.9 Other 147,246 132,209 111,319 15,037 11.4 20,890 18.8 Total segment operating profit $ 1,166,578 $ 978,663 $ 775,286 $ 187,915 19.2 % $ 203,377 26.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 9.5%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $1,284.0 million during 2008 to approximately $1,406.6 million in 2009.

The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added since such date was approximately $108.7 million and approximately $13.9 million, respectively. Within the segment, revenue from our insurance customers increased approximately $76.3 million over the prior year. Overall, the full year 2009 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the global IT services delivery model. However, revenue from our financial services segment grew slower than the rest of the company primarily due to the crisis in the financial services sector during 2009. We believe this trend, to a lesser extent, may continue during 2010. Segment Operating Profit.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $1,399.3 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) acquisitions of businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; (v) stock repurchases; and (vi) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2009, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $1,661.0 million as compared to working capital of approximately $1,080.5 million as of December 31, 2008. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $672.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $429.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2009 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2009 and higher incentive based compensation accruals, which are paid subsequent to year end. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $383.0 million at December 31, 2007 to approximately $517.5 million at December 31, 2008 and to approximately $626.3 million at December 31, 2009. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $53.5 million at December 31, 2007 to approximately $62.2 at December 31, 2008 and to approximately $83.0 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2009 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2009, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 72 days as compared to 71 days as of December 31, 2008 and 67 days as of December 31, 2007. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2009 primarily related to net purchases of short term investments and increased payments for acquisitions offset by a decrease in capital expenditures to coincide with the change in demand driven by the overall economic conditions. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2008 primarily related to decreased payments for acquisitions and the net effect of the sale of a portion of our auction rate securities investments and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds into cash and cash equivalents during the year. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2009 related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans and lower common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The increase in 2008 related primarily to lower common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and lower proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2009, our short term and long term investments totaled $449.5 million and included $129.1 million in long term of AAA/A3 rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $22.0 million of an auction rate securities related UBS Right discussed below. 57 Table of Contents Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS AG, or UBS, to sell to UBS, at par value, our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. During 2009, approximately $17.3 million of the auction rate securities were redeemed at par value. The par value of the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2009 was $151.3 million. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. If a liquidity event does not occur prior to the exercise period under the UBS Right, we expect to obtain liquidity through the UBS Right. If UBS is unable to honor its obligations under the UBS Right, we believe we will be able to ultimately recover our investment in auction rate municipal debt securities due to: (i) the strength of the underlying collateral, substantially backed by FFELP, and (ii) the AAA credit rating of the securities held by us. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security (up to 32 years) to realize our investments recorded value. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. Commitments and Contingencies Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $35.9 million related to our India development center expansion program. As of December 31, 2009, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 228,581 $ 62,404 $ 101,515 $ 46,503 $ 18,159 Fixed capital commitments(1) 35,936 35,936 Other purchase commitments(2) 12,464 12,464 Total $ 276,981 $ 110,804 $ 101,515 $ 46,503 $ 18,159 (1) Relates to India development and delivery center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. 58 Table of Contents In connection with a 2008 acquisition, additional purchase price not to exceed $14.0 million, payable in 2010, is contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial and operating targets during an earn out period. We expect to fund such payment, if any, from operating cash flow. The ultimate amount payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because the amount is dependent on future results of operations of the acquired business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not recorded a liability for this item on our balance sheet because the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. As of December 31, 2009, we had $10.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customers confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 79.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 27.5% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2009, were denominated in the Indian rupee and were subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2009, we reported foreign currency exchange gains, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately $22.5 million, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of (i) U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and (ii) Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiaries. During December 2008 and throughout 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges to buy Indian rupees and sell U.S. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of 59 Table of Contents movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. During 2009, we reported income of $8.9 million on contracts that settled during the year. As of December 31, 2009, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $450.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 49.44 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2010 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $360.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 48.49 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2011. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. During 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2010, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $400.0 million and the related fair value was a liability of $20.8 million. During 2009, inclusive of the loss of $20.8 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $1.7 million. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2009, 2008 and 2007 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services we offer has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Historically, we have experienced wage inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20.0% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance which defines fair value, establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It is appropriate to apply fair value measurements whenever other sections of the authoritative guidance requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. This authoritative guidance does not expand or require any new fair value measures, however the application of this guidance may change current practice. We adopted this authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2008 and for non financial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of this authoritative guidance, which primarily affected the valuation of our investments and derivative contracts, did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued several amendments to the accounting and disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities. These amendments are intended to provide guidance to: Determine fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. Bring consistency to the timing of impairment recognition, and provide improved disclosures about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. The 60 Table of Contents measure of impairment in comprehensive income remains fair value. The amendment also requires increased and timelier disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. Disclose financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value. Prior to issuing this amendment, fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed once a year. The amendment now requires these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. We elected to early adopt these amendments effective March 31, 2009. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted this revised guidance, which applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this revised guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition; however, the impact of this revised guidance on our future consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate in the future. In March 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for as hedges. This guidance requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under this guidance and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted this guidance and have presented the required information in Note 11. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing principles and requirements for recognition and disclosure of subsequent events in the financial statements. Our adoption of this guidance on June 30, 2009 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities. Specifically, the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity, and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (the Codification). The Codification does not alter current U.S. GAAP, but rather integrates existing accounting standards with other authoritative guidance. Under the Codification, there is a single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities and it supersedes all other previously issued non SEC accounting and reporting guidance. The Codification is effective for financial statement periods ending after September 15, 2009. Our adoption of the Codification on July 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the 61 Table of Contents inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on managements best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. In October 2009, the FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in Part I, in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the notional value of these contracts was $810.0 million and $82.0 million, respectively. The outstanding contracts at December 31, 2009 are scheduled to mature each month during 2010 and 2011. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $19.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based 62 Table of Contents upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $80.0 million. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. During 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2010, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $400.0 million and the related fair value was a liability of $20.8 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $42.0 million. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2009, 2008 and 2007 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1,550.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily in AAA/Aaa/A3 or A1/P1 rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. As of December 31, 2009, our short term and long term investments totaled $449.5 million and included $129.1 million in long term of AAA/A3 rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $22.0 million of an auction rate related UBS Right discussed below. Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS to sell to UBS, at par value, our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. At December 31, 2009, we determined the fair value of the UBS Right to be $22.0 million. During 2009, approximately $17.3 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2009, our revenues increased to $3,278.7 million compared to $2,816.3 million in 2008. Net income increased to $535.0 million or $1.78 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.12 per diluted share during 2009. This is compared to $430.8 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense net of tax of $0.15 per diluted share during 2008. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2009 were as follows: strong performance within our Healthcare and Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics business segments, each of which had revenue growth equal to or greater than 25.0%; strong performance in North America where we experienced revenue growth of 16.4% in 2009 as compared to 2008; continued penetration of the European market where we experienced revenue growth of 12.1%, and success with our recent entry in the Asian markets where we grew by 65.9%, in 2009 as compared to 2008; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, including application maintenance, complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 589 active clients compared to approximately 565 as of December 31, 2008 and increased the number of strategic clients by 16 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 144. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 17.4% and 29.4%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2009 as compared to 19.4% and 30.0%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2008. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to continue to decline over time. Our revenue from European customers increased by 12.1% to approximately $606.8 million in 2009 compared to approximately $541.1 million in 2008. Our operation in the United Kingdom, or UK reported a 7.8% increase in revenue to approximately $353.5 million in 2009, as compared to approximately $328.0 million in 2008. This increase is primarily attributed to growth from existing and new customers in our Healthcare and Manufacturing /Retail/Logistics business segments and was offset by year over year unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rates which negatively impacted revenue in 2009 by approximately $50.1 million. Revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately 18.9% to approximately $253.3 million in 2009 from approximately $213.1 million in 2008. We believe that Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region and the Asia Pacific region, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. Recent NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports state that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to reach almost $50 billion by the end of NASSCOMs fiscal year March 31, 2010. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 5.5% over the prior fiscal year. Additionally, the FY 2010 11 Outlook for these sectors expects revenue growth of 13% to 15%. According to the latest NASSCOM Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India report, global changes and new 43 Table of Contents megatrends within economic, demographic, business, social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of $175 billion by 2020. In 2009, our operating margin increased to 18.9% compared to 18.3% in 2008. Excluding stock based compensation costs of $44.8 million and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million, operating margin in 2009 was 20.3%. This was slightly above our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of our revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: (i) hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; (ii) training our technical staff in a broader range of IT service offerings; (iii) strengthening our business analytic capabilities; (iv) strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; (v) continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and (vi) recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For the year ending December 31, 2010, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our historical targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 78,400, an increase of approximately 16,700 over the prior year. The increases in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, are the primary drivers of the increase in our operating expenses in 2009. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 10.3% for 2009. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced wage inflation in India, which may continue in the future; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20% of our total operating expenses. Our current India real estate development program includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million through the end of the program on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art IT development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones located in India. During 2010, we expect to spend approximately $180 million globally for capital expenditures. At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $1,399.3 million and working capital of approximately $1,661.0 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2009, we repurchased $12.4 million of our Class A common stock under a stock repurchase program that expired in December 2009. Stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital. While several measures have indicated that the economy may be improving, the economic environment remains fragile. During 2010, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Stabilization of global economic conditions and the financial services sector; Normalization of customer IT budgets, which may result in spending by customers on discretionary projects, specifically application development projects. In addition, we expect a continued focus by 44 Table of Contents customers on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; Industry consolidation, which will drive demand for integration services; Secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes; and Foreign currency volatility. In response to this challenging macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings; Partner with our existing customers to see where we can provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Expand our BPO and infrastructure management practices, which are in high demand in this challenging business environment; Continue to aggressively increase our customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that can improve our overall service delivery capabilities; and Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation arrangements, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed price contracts, are recognized as the service is performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first 45 Table of Contents becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for all periods presented were immaterial. Stock Based Compensation. Utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock, the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited and the expected exercise proceeds for stock based awards subject to the Indian fringe benefit tax, if applicable. In addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively herein as Cognizant India, are export oriented companies which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park, or STPs, with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. In August 2009, the tax holidays for STPs were extended by one year and are currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2011. Thereafter, export profits from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.99% as of December 31, 2009) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2011, we expect that our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011. In addition, we expect to continue to locate a portion of our new development centers in areas designated as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs. Development centers operating in SEZs are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. 46 Table of Contents Investments. Historically, our investments have been in municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process, corporate notes and bonds, debt issuances by U.S. government agencies, bank time deposits and commercial paper meeting certain criteria. We evaluate our available for sale investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value. An impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value of our available for sale securities exceeds the fair market value of the securities and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. Determining the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity requires judgment, including determining the appropriate holding period and discount rate to be used in valuing such securities. We value our investment in auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow analysis, which incorporates the following key inputs: (i) the underlying structure of each security; (ii) frequency and amounts of cash flows; (iii) expected holding period for the security; and (iv) discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security. In estimating the holding period, we considered the current developments in the auction rate market including: our ability to hold the securities for such period of time, recent calls of auction rate securities by issuers and the possible reestablishment of an active market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Based upon these factors, we used a holding period of five years for securities with a stated maturity beyond five years, which represents the period of time we anticipate will elapse before a liquidity event could occur. An increase or decrease in the holding period by two years would change the fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $8.0 million. We derive the discount rate by considering observable interest rate yields for bonds supported by student loans and pricing of new bond issuances, and adding an illiquidity premium to such rates. The illiquidity premium was estimated by management considering current market conditions. As of December 31, 2009, we used a weighted average illiquidity premium of 290 basis points. This weighted average illiquidity premium has been impacted by overall issues within the credit and capital markets and related increases in volatility including uncertainty of the credit and money markets. An increase or decrease to the illiquidity premium of 100 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $6.0 million. Our valuation is also impacted by changes in market interest rates because the interest payments we receive on our auction rate securities vary based on a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. An increase or decrease in market interest rates of 25 basis points would change the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately $5.0 million. We anticipate there will be ongoing developments in the credit markets and the market for the auction rate securities that we hold. Accordingly, our estimates of the expected holding period and illiquidity premium used in valuing such securities may change in the short term. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. As of December 31, 2009, our goodwill balance was $192.4 million. Long Lived Assets. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future 47 Table of Contents cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our development and delivery centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management and our independent auditor to provide us with reasonable assurance regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2009: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues 2007 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 Revenues $ 3,278,663 100.0 % $ 2,816,304 100.0 % $ 2,135,577 100.0 % $ 462,359 $ 680,727 Cost of revenues(1) 1,849,443 56.4 1,572,816 55.8 1,206,035 56.5 276,627 366,781 Selling, general and administrative(2) 721,359 22.0 652,021 23.2 494,102 23.1 69,338 157,919 Depreciation and amortization 89,371 2.7 74,797 2.7 53,918 2.5 14,574 20,879 Income from operations 618,490 18.9 % 516,670 18.3 % 381,522 17.9 % 101,820 135,148 Other income (expense), net 18,461 (1,460 ) 32,834 19,921 (34,294 ) Provision for income taxes 101,988 84,365 64,223 17,623 20,142 Net income $ 534,963 16.3 % $ 430,845 15.3 % $ 350,133 16.4 % $ 104,118 $ 80,712 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $14,889, $18,715 and $17,206 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $187, $2,731 and $1,979 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $29,927, $25,185 and $18,710 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $758, $5,418 and $3,943 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. 48 Table of Contents The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation costs and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stock based compensation expense, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation that is recurring and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense that was repealed during the third quarter of 2009, retroactive to April 1, 2009. Stock based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues 2007 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 618,490 18.9 % $ 516,670 18.3 % $ 381,522 17.9 % Add: stock based compensation expense 44,816 1.4 43,900 1.6 35,916 1.7 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 945 8,149 0.3 5,922 0.2 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 664,251 20.3 % $ 568,719 20.2 % $ 423,360 19.8 % The fringe benefit tax regulation in India obligated us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to 49 Table of Contents date of vest. There was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. During the third quarter of 2009, the Indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to April 1, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenue. Revenue increased by 16.4%, or approximately $462.4 million, from approximately $2,816.3 million during 2008 to approximately $3,278.7 million in 2009. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 increased by approximately $375.9 million and revenue from new customers added since December 31, 2008 was approximately $86.5 million or approximately 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2009 by $365.9 million and $65.7 million, respectively, as compared to 2008. We had approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009 as compared to approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $122.6 million and $172.2 million, respectively, of the $462.4 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 10.2% and 21.9%, respectively, compared to 2008 and represented approximately 44.4% and 55.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2009. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 17.6% or $276.6 million from $1,572.8 million during 2008 to $1,849.4 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $267.1 million, inclusive of the depreciation of the Indian rupee, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel, and incentive based compensation, offset by continued improvements in operating efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 11.5% or $83.9 million, from $726.8 million during 2008, to $810.7 million during 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 25.8% in 2008 to 24.7% in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 19.7%, or $101.8 million, from approximately $516.7 million during 2008 to approximately $618.5 million during 2009, representing operating margins of approximately 18.9% of revenues in 2009 and 18.3% of revenues in 2008. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially 50 Table of Contents offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 255 basis points or 2.55 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 24 basis points or 0.24 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $45.8 million in 2009 and $52.0 million in 2008, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 20.3% and 20.2%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2009, these cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains (losses) $ 22,493 $ (22,818 ) $ 45,311 Gains (losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (20,821 ) (20,821 ) Net foreign currency exchange gains (losses) 1,672 (22,818 ) 24,490 Interest income 15,895 22,188 (6,293 ) Other income (expense), net 894 (830 ) 1,724 Total other income (expense), net $ 18,461 $ (1,460 ) $ 19,921 The foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $22.5 million were primarily attributed to (i) U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and (ii) the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $20.8 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $400.0 million. The $6.3 million decrease in interest income was due to lower average short term interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in other income (expense), net of $1.7 million primarily relates to gains on redemptions of certain auction rate securities offset by the net change in fair value of our auction rate securities and the related UBS Right. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $84.4 million in 2008 to approximately $102.0 million in 2009. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.4% in 2008 to 16.0% in 2009. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the tax impact of foreign exchange forward contracts, as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our income which resulted in a greater percentage of our revenues falling under income tax holidays. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $430.8 million in 2008 to approximately $535.0 million in 2009, representing 15.3% and 16.3% of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2009 is primarily attributed to a higher operating margin and foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest income. 51 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Revenue. Revenue increased by 31.9%, or approximately $680.7 million, from approximately $2,135.6 million during 2007 to approximately $2,816.3 million in 2008. This increase is primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2007 increased by approximately $550.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2008 was approximately $130.4 million or approximately 4.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, revenue from European customers in 2008 increased by $198.3 million as compared to 2007. We had approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008 as compared to approximately 500 active clients as of December 31, 2007. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $282.6 million and $183.7 million, respectively, of the $680.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 28.0% and 35.5%, respectively, compared to 2007 and represented approximately 46.9% and 53.1%, respectively, of total revenues in 2008. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 30.4%, or $366.8 million, from $1,206.0 million during 2007 to $1,572.8 million in 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $326.0 million, which is primarily attributed to the increase in the number of our technical personnel. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.6%, or $178.8 million, from $548.0 million during 2007 to $726.8 million during 2008, and increased slightly as a percentage of revenue from 25.7% in 2007 to 25.8% in 2008. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth, partially offset by the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 35.4%, or $135.2 million, from approximately $381.5 million during 2007 to approximately $516.7 million during 2008, representing operating margins of approximately 18.3% of revenues in 2008 and 17.9% of revenues in 2007. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to increased revenues, achieving operating efficiencies including leverage on prior sales and marketing investments and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $52.0 million in 2008 and $41.8 million in 2007, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 20.2% and 19.8%, respectively. Other Income/(Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net decreased from $32.8 million of income in 2007 to $1.5 million of expense in 2008, or by $34.3 million, and consists primarily of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains or losses. This $34.3 million decrease is attributed to a period over period decrease of $26.0 million in foreign currency exchange income attributed to the remeasurement of certain balance sheet accounts for movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound, Euro and Indian rupee, and a reduction of $7.4 million in interest income, from approximately $29.6 million in 2007 to $22.2 million in 2008. In 2008, foreign currency exchange losses were approximately $22.8 million, which are primarily attributed to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our 52 Table of Contents European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The decrease in interest income is primarily due to lower average short term interest rates in 2008 compared to 2007. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $64.2 million in 2007 to approximately $84.4 million in 2008. The effective income tax rate increased from 15.5% in 2007 to 16.4% in 2008. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to tax benefits of approximately $3.6 million recognized in 2007 resulting from the settlement of and expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax provisions and, in 2008, a net return to provision adjustment of $2.4 million. Excluding discrete items, our effective tax rate was 15.9% for 2008 compared to 16.4% for 2007. This decrease was primarily due to our overall growth, which resulted in a greater percentage of Cognizant Indias revenues falling under the income tax holiday, growth in countries whose tax rates were lower than the United States and net reductions in statutory income tax rates, primarily in Europe. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $350.1 million in 2007 to approximately $430.8 million in 2008, representing 16.4% and 15.3% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2008 was primarily attributed to the decrease in interest income and the foreign currency losses in 2008, partially offset by a higher operating margin in 2008. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes entertainment, media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed in Note 14 as unallocated and are adjusted only against the total income from operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 589 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. 53 Table of Contents Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as follows: 2009 2008 2009 2008 2007 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,406,629 $ 1,284,013 $ 1,001,420 $ 122,616 9.5 % $ 282,593 28.2 % Healthcare 860,427 688,224 504,504 172,203 25.0 183,720 36.4 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 564,917 443,236 320,116 121,681 27.5 123,120 38.5 Other 446,690 400,831 309,537 45,859 11.4 91,294 29.5 Total revenues $ 3,278,663 $ 2,816,304 $ 2,135,577 $ 462,359 16.4 % $ 680,727 31.9 % Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 503,689 $ 439,055 $ 355,696 $ 64,634 14.7 % $ 83,359 23.4 % Healthcare 331,007 270,790 199,791 60,217 22.2 70,999 35.5 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 184,636 136,609 108,480 48,027 35.2 28,129 25.9 Other 147,246 132,209 111,319 15,037 11.4 20,890 18.8 Total segment operating profit $ 1,166,578 $ 978,663 $ 775,286 $ 187,915 19.2 % $ 203,377 26.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 9.5%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $1,284.0 million during 2008 to approximately $1,406.6 million in 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added since such date was approximately $108.7 million and approximately $13.9 million, respectively. Within the segment, revenue from our insurance customers increased approximately $76.3 million over the prior year. Overall, the full year 2009 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the global IT services delivery model. However, revenue from our financial services segment grew slower than the rest of the company primarily due to the crisis in the financial services sector during 2009. We believe this trend, to a lesser extent, may continue during 2010. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 14.7%, or approximately $64.6 million, from approximately $439.1 million during 2008 to approximately $503.7 million during 2009.

The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added since such date was approximately $157.9 million and approximately $14.3 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among both our life sciences and healthcare customers, where revenue during 54 Table of Contents 2009 increased by approximately $93.1 million $79.1 million, respectively. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the global IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 22.2%, or approximately $60.2 million, from approximately $270.8 million during 2008 to approximately $331.0 million during 2009. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, achieving operating efficiencies and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing and wage inflation, primarily in India. Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 27.5%, or approximately $121.7 million, from approximately $443.2 million during 2008 to approximately $564.9 million in 2009.

The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added since such date was approximately $16.8 million and approximately $29.1 million, respectively. Within the Other segment, growth was particularly strong among our entertainment, media and information services customers, where revenue during 2009 increased approximately $41.2 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the global IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 11.4%, or approximately $15.0 million, from approximately $132.2 million in 2008 to approximately $147.2 million in 2009. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues during the year. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 28.2%, or approximately $282.6 million, from approximately $1,001.4 million during 2007 to approximately $1,284.0 million in 2008.

Within the 55 Table of Contents segment, full year revenue from our banking customers increased approximately $202.1 million over the prior year. However, our quarterly sequential revenue decreased in the latter portion of 2008 due to the continuing crisis in the financial services sector. Overall, the full year 2008 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of the global IT services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 23.4%, or approximately $83.4 million, from approximately $355.7 million during 2007 to approximately $439.1 million during 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2009, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $1,399.3 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for (i) expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers; (ii) continued development of new service lines; (iii) acquisitions of businesses; (iv) formation of joint ventures; (v) stock repurchases; and (vi) general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2009, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $1,661.0 million as compared to working capital of approximately $1,080.5 million as of December 31, 2008. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $672.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $429.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $344.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2009 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2009 and higher incentive based compensation accruals, which are paid subsequent to year end. Trade accounts receivable increased from approximately $383.0 million at December 31, 2007 to approximately $517.5 million at December 31, 2008 and to approximately $626.3 million at December 31, 2009. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $53.5 million at December 31, 2007 to approximately $62.2 at December 31, 2008 and to approximately $83.0 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2009 was due primarily to increased revenues and a higher number of days of sales outstanding. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2009, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 72 days as compared to 71 days as of December 31, 2008 and 67 days as of December 31, 2007. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $277.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2009 primarily related to net purchases of short term investments and increased payments for acquisitions offset by a decrease in capital expenditures to coincide with the change in demand driven by the overall economic conditions. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2008 primarily related to decreased payments for acquisitions and the net effect of the sale of a portion of our auction rate securities investments and subsequent reinvestment of the proceeds into cash and cash equivalents during the year. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in 2009 related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans and lower common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The increase in 2008 related primarily to lower common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and lower proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans. As of December 31, 2009, our short term and long term investments totaled $449.5 million and included $129.1 million in long term of AAA/A3 rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $22.0 million of an auction rate securities related UBS Right discussed below. 57 Table of Contents Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS AG, or UBS, to sell to UBS, at par value, our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. During 2009, approximately $17.3 million of the auction rate securities were redeemed at par value. The par value of the auction rate securities held by us at December 31, 2009 was $151.3 million. Based on our expected operating cash flows, and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute current and planned operations and needs for at least the next 12 months. If a liquidity event does not occur prior to the exercise period under the UBS Right, we expect to obtain liquidity through the UBS Right. If UBS is unable to honor its obligations under the UBS Right, we believe we will be able to ultimately recover our investment in auction rate municipal debt securities due to: (i) the strength of the underlying collateral, substantially backed by FFELP, and (ii) the AAA credit rating of the securities held by us. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying security (up to 32 years) to realize our investments recorded value. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a 12 month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from India, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. Commitments and Contingencies Our current India real estate development program now includes planned construction of approximately 4.5 million square feet of new space. The expanded program, which commenced during the quarter ended March 31, 2007, includes the expenditure of approximately $330.0 million on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $35.9 million related to our India development center expansion program. As of December 31, 2009, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 228,581 $ 62,404 $ 101,515 $ 46,503 $ 18,159 Fixed capital commitments(1) 35,936 35,936 Other purchase commitments(2) 12,464 12,464 Total $ 276,981 $ 110,804 $ 101,515 $ 46,503 $ 18,159 (1) Relates to India development and delivery center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. 58 Table of Contents In connection with a 2008 acquisition, additional purchase price not to exceed $14.0 million, payable in 2010, is contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial and operating targets during an earn out period. We expect to fund such payment, if any, from operating cash flow. The ultimate amount payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because the amount is dependent on future results of operations of the acquired business. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have not recorded a liability for this item on our balance sheet because the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable. The contingent consideration, if paid, will be recorded as an additional element of the cost of the acquired company. As of December 31, 2009, we had $10.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customers confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 79.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 were generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 27.5% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2009, were denominated in the Indian rupee and were subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2009, we reported foreign currency exchange gains, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately $22.5 million, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of (i) U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and (ii) Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiaries. During December 2008 and throughout 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges to buy Indian rupees and sell U.S. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of 59 Table of Contents movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. During 2009, we reported income of $8.9 million on contracts that settled during the year. As of December 31, 2009, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $450.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 49.44 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2010 and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $360.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 48.49 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2011. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. During 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2010, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $400.0 million and the related fair value was a liability of $20.8 million. During 2009, inclusive of the loss of $20.8 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $1.7 million. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2009, 2008 and 2007 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform the services we offer has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover cost increases through increases in the prices that we charge for our services in the United States and elsewhere. Historically, we have experienced wage inflation in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as Indian wages represented less than 20.0% of our total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance which defines fair value, establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. It is appropriate to apply fair value measurements whenever other sections of the authoritative guidance requires or permits assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value. This authoritative guidance does not expand or require any new fair value measures, however the application of this guidance may change current practice. We adopted this authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2008 and for non financial assets and liabilities effective January 1, 2009. The adoption of this authoritative guidance, which primarily affected the valuation of our investments and derivative contracts, did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In April 2009, the FASB issued several amendments to the accounting and disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities. These amendments are intended to provide guidance to: Determine fair values when there is no active market or where the price inputs being used represent distressed sales. It reaffirms the need to use judgment to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive. Bring consistency to the timing of impairment recognition, and provide improved disclosures about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold. The 60 Table of Contents measure of impairment in comprehensive income remains fair value. The amendment also requires increased and timelier disclosures regarding expected cash flows, credit losses, and an aging of securities with unrealized losses. Disclose financial instruments that are not currently reflected on the balance sheet at fair value. Prior to issuing this amendment, fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed once a year. The amendment now requires these disclosures on a quarterly basis, providing qualitative and quantitative information about fair value estimates for all those financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value. We elected to early adopt these amendments effective March 31, 2009. The adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction (whether a full or partial acquisition); establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed; requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs; and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted this revised guidance, which applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The adoption of this revised guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition; however, the impact of this revised guidance on our future consolidated financial statements will depend upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate in the future. In March 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which applies to all derivative instruments and related hedged items accounted for as hedges. This guidance requires entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under this guidance and its related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entitys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted this guidance and have presented the required information in Note 11. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance establishing principles and requirements for recognition and disclosure of subsequent events in the financial statements. Our adoption of this guidance on June 30, 2009 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities. Specifically, the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity, and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (the Codification). The Codification does not alter current U.S. GAAP, but rather integrates existing accounting standards with other authoritative guidance. Under the Codification, there is a single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP for nongovernmental entities and it supersedes all other previously issued non SEC accounting and reporting guidance. The Codification is effective for financial statement periods ending after September 15, 2009. Our adoption of the Codification on July 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the 61 Table of Contents inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on managements best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. In October 2009, the FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in Part I, in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the notional value of these contracts was $810.0 million and $82.0 million, respectively. The outstanding contracts at December 31, 2009 are scheduled to mature each month during 2010 and 2011. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $19.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based 62 Table of Contents upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $80.0 million. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. During 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2010, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $400.0 million and the related fair value was a liability of $20.8 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $42.0 million. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2009, 2008 and 2007 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $1,550.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We limit our credit risk by investing primarily in AAA/Aaa/A3 or A1/P1 rated securities as rated by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch rating services and restricting amounts that can be invested with any single issuer. As of December 31, 2009, our short term and long term investments totaled $449.5 million and included $129.1 million in long term of AAA/A3 rated auction rate municipal debt securities that are collateralized by debt obligations supported by student loans, substantially backed by the FFELP. In addition, the remainder of our long term investments included $22.0 million of an auction rate related UBS Right discussed below. Since February 14, 2008, auctions failed for all the auction rate securities still in our portfolio as of December 31, 2009. We believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of the securities and we continue to earn and receive interest on the auction rate municipal debt securities at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indices. All of the auction rate municipal debt securities held by us are callable by the issuer at par. In November 2008, we accepted an offer from UBS to sell to UBS, at par value, our auction rate securities at any time during an exercise period from June 30, 2010 to July 2, 2012, which we refer to as the UBS Right. In accepting the UBS Right, we granted UBS the authority to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par value any time after the execution of the UBS Right through July 2, 2012. The offer is non transferable. At December 31, 2009, we determined the fair value of the UBS Right to be $22.0 million. During 2009, approximately $17.3 million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value.
