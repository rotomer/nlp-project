Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2010, our revenues increased to $4,592.4 million compared to $3,278.7 million in 2009. Net income increased to $733.5 million or $2.37 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.14 per diluted share during 2010. This is compared to net income of $535.0 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, net of tax, of $0.12 per diluted share during 2009. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2010 were as follows: strong performance across all business segments with revenue growth ranging from 36.8% for Healthcare to 50.4% for Manufacturing, Retail and Logisitics as compared to 2009; continued penetration of the European market, particularly in the UK where we experienced revenue growth of 58.2% as compared to 2009; increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, including application maintenance, complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing, or BPO, and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 712 active clients compared to approximately 589 as of December 31, 2009 and increased the number of strategic clients by 22 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 166. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 17.9% and 30.3%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2010 as compared to 17.4% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time. Our revenue from European customers increased by 41.0% to approximately $855.6 million in 2010 compared to approximately $606.8 million in 2009. Revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $43.0 million from approximately $253.3 million in 2009 to approximately $296.3 million in 2010 and revenue from the UK increased by approximately $205.8 million from approximately $353.5 million in 2009 to approximately $559.3 million in 2010. We believe that Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region as well as the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports indicate that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed $76 billion at the end of NASSCOMs fiscal year 2011. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 19% over the prior fiscal year. According to the latest NASSCOM Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India report, global changes and new megatrends within economic, demographic, business, social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of $175 billion by 2020. 42 Table of Contents In 2010, our operating margin decreased slightly to 18.8% compared to 18.9% in 2009. Excluding stock based compensation expense of approximately $57.0 million, operating margin in 2010 was 20.0%. This was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Operating margin was affected by the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, an increase in compensation costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and any related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings; strengthening our business analytic capabilities; strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For the year ending December 31, 2011, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 104,000, which is an increase of approximately 25,600 over the prior year. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2010. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 18.5% for 2010. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, in India which may continue in the future; however, historically, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. Our current India real estate development program includes planned construction of an additional 8.0 million square feet of new space. The expanded program includes the expenditure of approximately $500.0 million between 2011 and the end of 2014 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new company owned state of the art IT development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs, located in India. During 2011, we expect to spend approximately $285 million globally for capital expenditures. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,226.4 million and working capital of $2,587.5 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2010 and 2009, we repurchased $41.9 million and $12.4 million, respectively, of our Class A common stock under various stock repurchase programs. Stock repurchases under these programs were funded from working capital. While several measures have indicated that the economy may be improving, the global economic environment remains fragile. During 2011, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Stabilization of global economic conditions and the financial services sector; Normalization of customer IT budgets, which may result in spending by customers on discretionary projects, specifically application development projects; Continued focus by customers on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; 43 Table of Contents Secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes; Foreign currency volatility; and Increase in our effective income tax rate as a result of the expiration of tax holiday benefits related to our STP facilities in India. In response to this fragile macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings; Partner with our existing customers to provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Continue to increase our strategic customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that can improve our overall service delivery capabilities; Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure; and Continue to locate most of our new development center facilities in SEZs to take advantage of SEZ tax incentives. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of short and long term investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation awards and derivative financial investments, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed price contracts, are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the 44 Table of Contents estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial. Stock Based Compensation. Utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. In addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively herein as Cognizant India, are export oriented companies which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park, or STP, with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. In addition, we have constructed our newer development facilities in SEZs, which are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. We expect to continue to locate most of our new development centers in these areas. The tax holidays for STPs are currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2011. Thereafter, export profits from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.22% as of December 31, 2010) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2011, our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011. 45 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. This model utilizes various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, and credit risk factors. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Investments. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, foreign governments and supranational entities, asset backed securities, and bank time deposits. The asset backed securities include securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, and other receivables and are rated AAA/Aaa. The years of issuance of our asset backed securities fall in the 2001 to 2010 range. Historically, our investments have also included municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process. We utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio. To the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices on similar assets (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets, valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (Level 3). Valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 10 for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies. We periodically evaluate if unrealized losses, as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above, on individual securities classified as available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other than temporary. The analysis of other than temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions, including, but not limited to, the length of time an investments book value is greater than fair value, the severity of the investments decline, any credit deterioration of the investment, whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is generally recorded to earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. Based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill, there are no significant risks of impairment. As of December 31, 2010, our goodwill balance was $224.0 million. Long Lived Assets. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future 46 Table of Contents cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our development and delivery centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2010: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Revenues $ 4,592,389 100.0 % $ 3,278,663 100.0 % $ 2,816,304 100.0 % $ 1,313,726 $ 462,359 Cost of revenues(1)  2,654,569 57.8 1,849,443 56.4 1,572,816 55.8 805,126 276,627 Selling, general and administrative(2) 972,093 21.2 721,359 22.0 652,021 23.2 250,734 69,338 Depreciation and amortization 103,875 2.3 89,371 2.7 74,797 2.7 14,504 14,574 Income from operations 861,852 18.8 618,490 18.9 516,670 18.3 243,362 101,820 Other income (expense), net 16,728 18,461 (1,460 ) (1,733 ) 19,921 Provision for income taxes 145,040 101,988 84,365 43,052 17,623 Net income $ 733,540 16.0 % $ 534,963 16.3 % $ 430,845 15.3 % $ 198,577 $ 104,118 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $13,147, $14,889 and $18,715 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $187 and $2,731 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $43,837, $29,927 and $25,185 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $758 and $5,418 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax, which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009, retroactive to April 1, 2009, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stock based compensation expense, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of 48 Table of Contents other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax. Stock based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 861,852 18.8 % $ 618,490 18.9 % $ 516,670 18.3 % Add: stock based compensation expense 56,984 1.2 44,816 1.4 43,900 1.6 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 945 8,149 0.3 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 918,836 20.0 % $ 664,251 20.3 % $ 568,719 20.2 % The fringe benefit tax regulation in India obligated us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. During the third quarter of 2009, the Indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to April 1, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue. Revenue increased by 40.1%, or approximately $1,313.7 million, from approximately $3,278.7 million during 2009 to approximately $4,592.4 million in 2010. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs, increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects, and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 increased by approximately $1,193.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2010 was approximately $120.4 million or approximately 9.2% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2010 by $988.5 million and $248.8 million, respectively, as compared to 2009. We had approximately 712 active 49 Table of Contents clients as of December 31, 2010 as compared to approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $537.8 million and $316.7 million, respectively, of the $1,313.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 52.1% and 30.4%, respectively, compared to 2009 and represented approximately 48.3% and 51.7%, respectively, of total revenues in 2010. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues during 2010 and 2009. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 43.5% or $805.2 million from $1,849.4 million during 2009 to $2,654.6 million in 2010. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately $671.2 million, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel and incentive based compensation, as well as the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.7% or $265.2 million, from $810.7 million during 2009, to $1,075.9 million during 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 24.7% in 2009 to 23.4% in 2010. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 39.3%, or $243.4 million, from approximately $618.5 million during 2009 to approximately $861.9 million during 2010, representing operating margins of 18.8% of revenues in 2010 and 18.9% of revenues in 2009. The operating margin was impacted by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 157 basis points or 1.57 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $57.0 million and $44.8 million for 2010 and 2009 and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million in 2009, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 20.0% and 20.3%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2010, settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 91 basis points or 0.91 percentage points. 50 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains $ 11,220 $ 22,493 $ (11,273 ) (Losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (21,088 ) (20,821 ) (267 ) Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains (9,868 ) 1,672 (11,540 ) Interest income 25,793 15,895 9,898 Other, net 803 894 (91 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 16,728 $ 18,461 $ (1,733 ) The foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $11.2 million were primarily attributed to intercompany transactions between our European subsidiaries and Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $21.1 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2010. At December 31, 2010, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $234.0 million. The $9.9 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $102.0 million in 2009 to approximately $145.0 million in 2010. The effective income tax rate increased from 16.0% in 2009 to 16.5% in 2010. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to discrete tax items in 2010, a higher U.S. state effective income tax rate in 2010, as well as an increase in our taxable income in India resulting from an increase in non export profits that are taxable at the India statutory rate. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $535.0 million in 2009 to approximately $733.5 million in 2010, representing 16.3% and 16.0% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2010 is primarily attributed to an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses and a higher effective income tax rate. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenue. Revenue increased by 16.4%, or approximately $462.4 million, from approximately $2,816.3 million during 2008 to approximately $3,278.7 million in 2009. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 increased by approximately $375.9 million and revenue from new customers added during 2009 was approximately $86.5 million or approximately 18.7% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2009 by $365.9 million and $65.7 million, respectively, as compared to 2008. We had approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009 as compared to approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $122.6 million and $172.2 million, respectively, of the $462.4 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 10.2% and 21.9%, respectively, compared to 2008 and represented approximately 44.4% and 55.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2009. 51 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 17.6% or $276.6 million from $1,572.8 million during 2008 to $1,849.4 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $267.1 million, inclusive of the depreciation of the Indian rupee, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel, and incentive based compensation, offset by continued improvements in operating efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 11.5% or $83.9 million, from $726.8 million during 2008, to $810.7 million during 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 25.8% in 2008 to 24.7% in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 19.7%, or $101.8 million, from approximately $516.7 million during 2008 to approximately $618.5 million during 2009, representing operating margins of approximately 18.9% of revenues in 2009 and 18.3% of revenues in 2008. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 255 basis points or 2.55 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar would have had the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 24 basis points or 0.24 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $45.8 million in 2009 and $52.0 million in 2008, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 20.3% and 20.2%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2009, these cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. 52 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains $ 22,493 $ (22,818 ) $ 45,311 (Losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (20,821 ) (20,821 ) Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains 1,672 (22,818 ) 24,490 Interest income 15,895 22,188 (6,293 ) Other, net 894 (830 ) 1,724 Total other income (expense), net $ 18,461 $ (1,460 ) $ 19,921 In 2009, foreign currency exchange gains were approximately $22.5 million, which were primarily attributed to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $20.8 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $400.0 million. The $6.3 million decrease in interest income was due to lower average short term interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in other, net of $1.7 million primarily related to gains on redemptions of certain auction rate securities offset by the net change in fair value of our auction rate securities and the related UBS Right. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $84.4 million in 2008 to approximately $102.0 million in 2009. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.4% in 2008 to 16.0% in 2009. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the tax impact of foreign exchange forward contracts, as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our income which resulted in a greater percentage of our revenues falling under income tax holidays. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $430.8 million in 2008 to approximately $535.0 million in 2009, representing 15.3% and 16.3% of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2009 was primarily attributed to a higher operating margin and foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest income. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes entertainment, media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before 53 Table of Contents unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and are adjusted only against the total income from operations. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 712 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: 2010 2009 2010 2009 2008 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,944,450 $ 1,406,629 $ 1,284,013 $ 537,821 38.2 % $ 122,616 9.5 % Healthcare 1,177,113 860,427 688,224 316,686 36.8 172,203 25.0 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 849,643 564,917 443,236 284,726 50.4 121,681 27.5 Other 621,183 446,690 400,831 174,493 39.1 45,859 11.4 Total revenues $ 4,592,389 $ 3,278,663 $ 2,816,304 $ 1,313,726 40.1 % $ 462,359 16.4 % Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 668,595 $ 503,689 $ 439,055 $ 164,906 32.7 % $ 64,634 14.7 % Healthcare 436,879 331,007 270,790 105,872 32.0 60,217 22.2 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 283,676 184,636 136,609 99,040 53.6 48,027 35.2 Other 208,306 147,246 132,209 61,060 41.5 15,037 11.4 Total segment operating profit $ 1,597,456 $ 1,166,578 $ 978,663 $ 430,878 36.9 % $ 187,915 19.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Financial Services Segment Revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,226.4 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers; continued development of new service lines; possible acquisitions of related businesses; formation of joint ventures; stock repurchases; and general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2010, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $2,587.5 million as compared to working capital of approximately $1,661.0 million as of December 31, 2009. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $764.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $672.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $429.7 million for the year ended 57 Table of Contents December 31, 2008. The increase in 2010 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2010 and higher incentive based compensation accruals, which are paid subsequent to year end. This increase was offset by increases in certain accounts, including trade accounts receivable which, increased from approximately $517.5 million at December 31, 2008 to approximately $626.3 million at December 31, 2009 and to approximately $901.3 million at December 31, 2010. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $62.2 million at December 31, 2008 to approximately $83.0 at December 31, 2009 and to approximately $113.0 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2010 was due primarily to increased revenues. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2010, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 71 days as compared to 72 days as of December 31, 2009 and 71 days as of December 31, 2008. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $446.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures during the year partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions and a decrease in net purchases of investments. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2010 related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans partially offset by additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, our short term investments totaled $685.4 million. In the second quarter of 2010, our auction rate municipal debt securities were redeemed by the issuers or purchased by UBS reducing our outstanding balance to zero. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $56.6 million related to our India development center expansion program, which included expenditures for land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2010, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 327,759 $ 83,364 $ 136,123 $ 70,564 $ 37,708 Fixed capital commitments(1) 56,587 56,587 Other purchase commitments(2) 46,427 23,213 23,214 Total $ 430,773 $ 163,164 $ 159,337 $ 70,564 $ 37,708 58 Table of Contents (1) Relates to our India development and delivery center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. As of December 31, 2010, we had $23.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customers confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 78.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 33.2% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2010, are denominated in the Indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2010 and 2009, we reported foreign currency exchange gains, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately $11.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of intercompany balances between our European subsidiaries and Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiaries. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges to buy Indian rupees and sell U.S. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. During 2010 and 2009, we reported income of $41.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively, on 59 Table of Contents contracts that settled during each year. As of December 31, 2010, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $780.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 48.01 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2011, outstanding contracts with a notional value of $780.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 48.10 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2012, and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $600.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 50.07 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2013. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. During 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2010, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees during 2010. During 2010, we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2011. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.0 million and $400 million, respectively, and the related fair values were a liability of $7.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively. During 2010 and 2009, inclusive of losses of $21.1 million and $20.8 million, respectively, on these undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange (losses) and gains of approximately ($9.9) million and $1.7 million, respectively. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2010, 2009 and 2008 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. Historically, we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on managements best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. In October 2009, the FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards are required to be effective by no later than the first quarter of 2011 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted both of these standards effective January 1, 2010. Our adoption of these standards did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance requiring supplemental fair value disclosures and providing several clarifications regarding existing disclosure requirements. Specifically, the new guidance requires an 60 Table of Contents entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the new standard requires a gross presentation of the Level 3 rollforward, stating separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. The new guidance also provides clarification regarding the appropriate level of disaggregation of assets and liabilities for the purpose of fair value disclosures as well as the requirement to provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2010 and have presented the required information in Note 10 in our consolidated financial statements included herein. In December 2010, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring that Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test be performed for reporting units whose carrying value is zero or negative. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In December 2010, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying some of the disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. Specifically, the guidance states that, if comparative financial statements are presented, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. Additionally, the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. However, it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions.

We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in Part I, in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. 61 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the notional value of these contracts was $2,160.0 million and $810.0 million, respectively. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2010 are scheduled to mature each month during 2011, 2012, and 2013. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $32.3 million and $19.0 million, respectively. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2010, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $205.3 million. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2011, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees. At December 31, 2010, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.0 million and the related fair value was a liability of $7.3 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2010, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $23.8 million. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2010, 2009 and 2008 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2,226.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As of December 31, 2010, our short term investments totaled $685.4 million. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies, debt issuances by foreign governments and supranational entities, asset backed securities, and bank time deposits. 62 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2010, our revenues increased to $4,592.4 million compared to $3,278.7 million in 2009. Net income increased to $733.5 million or $2.37 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.14 per diluted share during 2010. This is compared to net income of $535.0 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, net of tax, of $0.12 per diluted share during 2009. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2010 were as follows: strong performance across all business segments with revenue growth ranging from 36.8% for Healthcare to 50.4% for Manufacturing, Retail and Logisitics as compared to 2009; continued penetration of the European market, particularly in the UK where we experienced revenue growth of 58.2% as compared to 2009; increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued increase in demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, including application maintenance, complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing, or BPO, and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 712 active clients compared to approximately 589 as of December 31, 2009 and increased the number of strategic clients by 22 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 166. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 17.9% and 30.3%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2010 as compared to 17.4% and 29.4%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time. Our revenue from European customers increased by 41.0% to approximately $855.6 million in 2010 compared to approximately $606.8 million in 2009. Revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $43.0 million from approximately $253.3 million in 2009 to approximately $296.3 million in 2010 and revenue from the UK increased by approximately $205.8 million from approximately $353.5 million in 2009 to approximately $559.3 million in 2010. We believe that Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region as well as the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports indicate that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed $76 billion at the end of NASSCOMs fiscal year 2011. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 19% over the prior fiscal year. According to the latest NASSCOM Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India report, global changes and new megatrends within economic, demographic, business, social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of $175 billion by 2020. 42 Table of Contents In 2010, our operating margin decreased slightly to 18.8% compared to 18.9% in 2009. Excluding stock based compensation expense of approximately $57.0 million, operating margin in 2010 was 20.0%. This was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Operating margin was affected by the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, an increase in compensation costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and any related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings; strengthening our business analytic capabilities; strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For the year ending December 31, 2011, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 104,000, which is an increase of approximately 25,600 over the prior year. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2010. Annualized turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 18.5% for 2010. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, in India which may continue in the future; however, historically, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. Our current India real estate development program includes planned construction of an additional 8.0 million square feet of new space. The expanded program includes the expenditure of approximately $500.0 million between 2011 and the end of 2014 on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new company owned state of the art IT development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs, located in India. During 2011, we expect to spend approximately $285 million globally for capital expenditures. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,226.4 million and working capital of $2,587.5 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2010 and 2009, we repurchased $41.9 million and $12.4 million, respectively, of our Class A common stock under various stock repurchase programs. Stock repurchases under these programs were funded from working capital. While several measures have indicated that the economy may be improving, the global economic environment remains fragile. During 2011, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Stabilization of global economic conditions and the financial services sector; Normalization of customer IT budgets, which may result in spending by customers on discretionary projects, specifically application development projects; Continued focus by customers on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; 43 Table of Contents Secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes; Foreign currency volatility; and Increase in our effective income tax rate as a result of the expiration of tax holiday benefits related to our STP facilities in India. In response to this fragile macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings; Partner with our existing customers to provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Continue to increase our strategic customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that can improve our overall service delivery capabilities; Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure; and Continue to locate most of our new development center facilities in SEZs to take advantage of SEZ tax incentives. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of short and long term investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation awards and derivative financial investments, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed price contracts, are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the 44 Table of Contents estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial. Stock Based Compensation. Utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. In addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, if any, involves judgment. As a global company, we are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can also affect the overall effective income tax rate. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. On an on going basis, we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we have considered future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we determine that we will be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred income tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively herein as Cognizant India, are export oriented companies which, under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, are entitled to claim tax holidays for a period of ten consecutive years for each Software Technology Park, or STP, with respect to export profits for each STP. Substantially all of the earnings of Cognizant India are attributable to export profits. The majority of our STPs in India are currently entitled to a 100% exemption from Indian income tax. In addition, we have constructed our newer development facilities in SEZs, which are entitled to certain income tax incentives for periods up to 15 years. We expect to continue to locate most of our new development centers in these areas. The tax holidays for STPs are currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2011. Thereafter, export profits from our existing STPs will be fully taxable at the Indian statutory rate (33.22% as of December 31, 2010) in effect at such time. If the tax holidays relating to our Indian STPs are not extended or new tax incentives are not introduced that would effectively extend the income tax holiday benefits beyond March 2011, our effective income tax rate will increase significantly beginning in calendar year 2011. 45 Table of Contents Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. This model utilizes various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, and credit risk factors. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Investments. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, foreign governments and supranational entities, asset backed securities, and bank time deposits. The asset backed securities include securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, and other receivables and are rated AAA/Aaa. The years of issuance of our asset backed securities fall in the 2001 to 2010 range. Historically, our investments have also included municipal debt securities with interest rates that reset through a Dutch auction process. We utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio. To the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices on similar assets (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets, valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (Level 3). Valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 10 for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies. We periodically evaluate if unrealized losses, as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above, on individual securities classified as available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other than temporary. The analysis of other than temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions, including, but not limited to, the length of time an investments book value is greater than fair value, the severity of the investments decline, any credit deterioration of the investment, whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is generally recorded to earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. Based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill, there are no significant risks of impairment. As of December 31, 2010, our goodwill balance was $224.0 million. Long Lived Assets. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future 46 Table of Contents cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our development and delivery centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 47 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2010: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2010 2009 Revenues $ 4,592,389 100.0 % $ 3,278,663 100.0 % $ 2,816,304 100.0 % $ 1,313,726 $ 462,359 Cost of revenues(1)  2,654,569 57.8 1,849,443 56.4 1,572,816 55.8 805,126 276,627 Selling, general and administrative(2) 972,093 21.2 721,359 22.0 652,021 23.2 250,734 69,338 Depreciation and amortization 103,875 2.3 89,371 2.7 74,797 2.7 14,504 14,574 Income from operations 861,852 18.8 618,490 18.9 516,670 18.3 243,362 101,820 Other income (expense), net 16,728 18,461 (1,460 ) (1,733 ) 19,921 Provision for income taxes 145,040 101,988 84,365 43,052 17,623 Net income $ 733,540 16.0 % $ 534,963 16.3 % $ 430,845 15.3 % $ 198,577 $ 104,118 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $13,147, $14,889 and $18,715 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $187 and $2,731 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $43,837, $29,927 and $25,185 for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $758 and $5,418 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax, which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009, retroactive to April 1, 2009, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stock based compensation expense, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of 48 Table of Contents other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations, excludes costs, namely, stock based compensation that is recurring and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax. Stock based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues 2008 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 861,852 18.8 % $ 618,490 18.9 % $ 516,670 18.3 % Add: stock based compensation expense 56,984 1.2 44,816 1.4 43,900 1.6 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 945 8,149 0.3 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 918,836 20.0 % $ 664,251 20.3 % $ 568,719 20.2 % The fringe benefit tax regulation in India obligated us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. During the third quarter of 2009, the Indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to April 1, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue. Revenue increased by 40.1%, or approximately $1,313.7 million, from approximately $3,278.7 million during 2009 to approximately $4,592.4 million in 2010. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs, increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects, and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 increased by approximately $1,193.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2010 was approximately $120.4 million or approximately 9.2% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2010 by $988.5 million and $248.8 million, respectively, as compared to 2009. We had approximately 712 active 49 Table of Contents clients as of December 31, 2010 as compared to approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $537.8 million and $316.7 million, respectively, of the $1,313.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 52.1% and 30.4%, respectively, compared to 2009 and represented approximately 48.3% and 51.7%, respectively, of total revenues in 2010. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues during 2010 and 2009. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 43.5% or $805.2 million from $1,849.4 million during 2009 to $2,654.6 million in 2010. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately $671.2 million, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel and incentive based compensation, as well as the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.7% or $265.2 million, from $810.7 million during 2009, to $1,075.9 million during 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 24.7% in 2009 to 23.4% in 2010. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 39.3%, or $243.4 million, from approximately $618.5 million during 2009 to approximately $861.9 million during 2010, representing operating margins of 18.8% of revenues in 2010 and 18.9% of revenues in 2009. The operating margin was impacted by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 157 basis points or 1.57 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $57.0 million and $44.8 million for 2010 and 2009 and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million in 2009, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 20.0% and 20.3%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2010, settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 91 basis points or 0.91 percentage points. 50 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains $ 11,220 $ 22,493 $ (11,273 ) (Losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (21,088 ) (20,821 ) (267 ) Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains (9,868 ) 1,672 (11,540 ) Interest income 25,793 15,895 9,898 Other, net 803 894 (91 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 16,728 $ 18,461 $ (1,733 ) The foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $11.2 million were primarily attributed to intercompany transactions between our European subsidiaries and Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $21.1 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2010. At December 31, 2010, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $234.0 million. The $9.9 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $102.0 million in 2009 to approximately $145.0 million in 2010. The effective income tax rate increased from 16.0% in 2009 to 16.5% in 2010. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to discrete tax items in 2010, a higher U.S. state effective income tax rate in 2010, as well as an increase in our taxable income in India resulting from an increase in non export profits that are taxable at the India statutory rate. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $535.0 million in 2009 to approximately $733.5 million in 2010, representing 16.3% and 16.0% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2010 is primarily attributed to an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses and a higher effective income tax rate. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Revenue. Revenue increased by 16.4%, or approximately $462.4 million, from approximately $2,816.3 million during 2008 to approximately $3,278.7 million in 2009. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 increased by approximately $375.9 million and revenue from new customers added during 2009 was approximately $86.5 million or approximately 18.7% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2009 by $365.9 million and $65.7 million, respectively, as compared to 2008. We had approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009 as compared to approximately 565 active clients as of December 31, 2008. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $122.6 million and $172.2 million, respectively, of the $462.4 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 10.2% and 21.9%, respectively, compared to 2008 and represented approximately 44.4% and 55.6%, respectively, of total revenues in 2009. 51 Table of Contents Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 17.6% or $276.6 million from $1,572.8 million during 2008 to $1,849.4 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits costs of approximately $267.1 million, inclusive of the depreciation of the Indian rupee, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel, and incentive based compensation, offset by continued improvements in operating efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense and related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 11.5% or $83.9 million, from $726.8 million during 2008, to $810.7 million during 2009, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 25.8% in 2008 to 24.7% in 2009. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, reductions in discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense and expenses related to the expansion of our infrastructure to support our revenue growth. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 19.7%, or $101.8 million, from approximately $516.7 million during 2008 to approximately $618.5 million during 2009, representing operating margins of approximately 18.9% of revenues in 2009 and 18.3% of revenues in 2008. The operating margin increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies as a result of revenue growth outpacing our headcount growth, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 255 basis points or 2.55 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar would have had the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 24 basis points or 0.24 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $45.8 million in 2009 and $52.0 million in 2008, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were 20.3% and 20.2%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain salary payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2009, these cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. 52 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2009 2008 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains $ 22,493 $ (22,818 ) $ 45,311 (Losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (20,821 ) (20,821 ) Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains 1,672 (22,818 ) 24,490 Interest income 15,895 22,188 (6,293 ) Other, net 894 (830 ) 1,724 Total other income (expense), net $ 18,461 $ (1,460 ) $ 19,921 In 2009, foreign currency exchange gains were approximately $22.5 million, which were primarily attributed to U.S. dollar denominated intercompany payables from our European subsidiaries to Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $20.8 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2009, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $400.0 million. The $6.3 million decrease in interest income was due to lower average short term interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase in other, net of $1.7 million primarily related to gains on redemptions of certain auction rate securities offset by the net change in fair value of our auction rate securities and the related UBS Right. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $84.4 million in 2008 to approximately $102.0 million in 2009. The effective income tax rate decreased from 16.4% in 2008 to 16.0% in 2009. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the tax impact of foreign exchange forward contracts, as well as a shift in the geographic mix of our income which resulted in a greater percentage of our revenues falling under income tax holidays. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $430.8 million in 2008 to approximately $535.0 million in 2009, representing 15.3% and 16.3% of revenues, respectively. The increase in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2009 was primarily attributed to a higher operating margin and foreign currency exchange gains partially offset by lower interest income. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes entertainment, media and information services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before 53 Table of Contents unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers. Certain expenses, such as general and administrative, and a portion of depreciation and amortization, are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management does not believe it is practical to allocate such costs to individual segments because they are not directly attributable to any specific segment. Further, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, these expenses are separately disclosed as unallocated and are adjusted only against the total income from operations. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 712 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows: 2010 2009 2010 2009 2008 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 1,944,450 $ 1,406,629 $ 1,284,013 $ 537,821 38.2 % $ 122,616 9.5 % Healthcare 1,177,113 860,427 688,224 316,686 36.8 172,203 25.0 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 849,643 564,917 443,236 284,726 50.4 121,681 27.5 Other 621,183 446,690 400,831 174,493 39.1 45,859 11.4 Total revenues $ 4,592,389 $ 3,278,663 $ 2,816,304 $ 1,313,726 40.1 % $ 462,359 16.4 % Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 668,595 $ 503,689 $ 439,055 $ 164,906 32.7 % $ 64,634 14.7 % Healthcare 436,879 331,007 270,790 105,872 32.0 60,217 22.2 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 283,676 184,636 136,609 99,040 53.6 48,027 35.2 Other 208,306 147,246 132,209 61,060 41.5 15,037 11.4 Total segment operating profit $ 1,597,456 $ 1,166,578 $ 978,663 $ 430,878 36.9 % $ 187,915 19.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 38.2%, or approximately $537.8 million, from approximately $1,406.6 million during 2009 to approximately $1,944.5 million in 2010. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 and customers added 54 Table of Contents during 2010 was approximately $508.1 million and approximately $29.7 million, respectively. Within the segment, revenue from our banking and insurance customers increased approximately $410.3 million and $127.5 million, respectively, over the prior year. Overall, the full year 2010 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model and increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 32.7%, or approximately $164.9 million, from approximately $503.7 million during 2009 to approximately $668.6 million during 2010.

The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model and increase in discretionary development projects. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 32.0%, or approximately $105.9 million, from approximately $331.0 million during 2009 to approximately $436.9 million during 2010. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing, an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 50.4%, or approximately $284.7 million, from approximately $564.9 million during 2009 to approximately $849.6 million in 2010.

Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 53.6%, or approximately $99.1 million, from approximately $184.6 million during 2009 to approximately $283.7 million during 2010. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues during the year and achieving operating efficiencies, including continued leverage of prior sales and marketing investments, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. 55 Table of Contents Other Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 39.1%, or approximately $174.5 million, from approximately $446.7 million in 2009 to approximately $621.2 million in 2010. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 and customers added during 2010 was approximately $149.6 million and approximately $24.9 million, respectively. Within the Other segment, growth was particularly strong among both our entertainment, media and information services customers and our telecommunication customers, where revenue during 2010 increased approximately $74.1 million and $56.6 million, respectively. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model and increase in discretionary development projects.

The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues during the year and achieving operating efficiencies, including continual leverage of prior sales and marketing investments, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 9.5%, or approximately $122.6 million, from approximately $1,284.0 million during 2008 to approximately $1,406.6 million in 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added during 2009 was approximately $108.7 million and approximately $13.9 million, respectively. Within the segment, revenue from our insurance customers increased approximately $76.3 million over the prior year. Overall, the full year 2009 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model. However, revenue from our financial services segment grew slower than the rest of the company primarily due to the crisis in the financial services sector during 2009. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 14.7%, or approximately $64.6 million, from approximately $439.1 million during 2008 to approximately $503.7 million during 2009. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies, including continued leverage of prior sales and marketing investments. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 25.0%, or approximately $172.2 million, from approximately $688.2 million during 2008 to approximately $860.4 million in 2009.

The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model. 56 Table of Contents Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 22.2%, or approximately $60.2 million, from approximately $270.8 million during 2008 to approximately $331.0 million during 2009. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, achieving operating efficiencies and the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, continued investment in sales and marketing and wage inflation, primarily in India. Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 27.5%, or approximately $121.7 million, from approximately $443.2 million during 2008 to approximately $564.9 million in 2009. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added during 2009 was approximately $92.5 million and approximately $29.2 million, respectively. Within the segment, growth was particularly strong among our retail and hospitality customers, where revenue during 2009 increased by approximately $92.3 million. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 35.2%, or approximately $48.0 million, from approximately $136.6 million during 2008 to approximately $184.6 million during 2009. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues, the impact of the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar and achieving operating efficiencies, including continued leverage of prior sales and marketing investments.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2008 and customers added during 2009 was approximately $16.8 million and approximately $29.1 million, respectively. Within the Other segment, growth was particularly strong among our entertainment media and information services customers, where revenue during 2009 increased approximately $41.2 million over the prior year. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 11.4%, or approximately $15.0 million, from approximately $132.2 million in 2008 to approximately $147.2 million in 2009. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues during the year. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,226.4 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers; continued development of new service lines; possible acquisitions of related businesses; formation of joint ventures; stock repurchases; and general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2010, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $2,587.5 million as compared to working capital of approximately $1,661.0 million as of December 31, 2009. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $764.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $672.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $429.7 million for the year ended 57 Table of Contents December 31, 2008. The increase in 2010 as compared to the prior year is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income in 2010 and higher incentive based compensation accruals, which are paid subsequent to year end. This increase was offset by increases in certain accounts, including trade accounts receivable which, increased from approximately $517.5 million at December 31, 2008 to approximately $626.3 million at December 31, 2009 and to approximately $901.3 million at December 31, 2010. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $62.2 million at December 31, 2008 to approximately $83.0 at December 31, 2009 and to approximately $113.0 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2010 was due primarily to increased revenues. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2010, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 71 days as compared to 72 days as of December 31, 2009 and 71 days as of December 31, 2008. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $446.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures during the year partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions and a decrease in net purchases of investments. Our financing activities provided net cash of approximately $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in 2010 related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans partially offset by additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, our short term investments totaled $685.4 million. In the second quarter of 2010, our auction rate municipal debt securities were redeemed by the issuers or purchased by UBS reducing our outstanding balance to zero. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $56.6 million related to our India development center expansion program, which included expenditures for land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2010, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 327,759 $ 83,364 $ 136,123 $ 70,564 $ 37,708 Fixed capital commitments(1) 56,587 56,587 Other purchase commitments(2) 46,427 23,213 23,214 Total $ 430,773 $ 163,164 $ 159,337 $ 70,564 $ 37,708 58 Table of Contents (1) Relates to our India development and delivery center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. As of December 31, 2010, we had $23.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customers confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 78.0% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 33.2% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2010, are denominated in the Indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2010 and 2009, we reported foreign currency exchange gains, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately $11.2 million and $22.5 million, respectively, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of intercompany balances between our European subsidiaries and Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to the Indian rupee in our Indian subsidiaries. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges to buy Indian rupees and sell U.S. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. During 2010 and 2009, we reported income of $41.6 million and $8.9 million, respectively, on 59 Table of Contents contracts that settled during each year. As of December 31, 2010, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $780.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 48.01 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2011, outstanding contracts with a notional value of $780.0 million and weighted average forward rate of 48.10 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2012, and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $600.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 50.07 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2013. We also use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. During 2009, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2010, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees during 2010. During 2010, we entered into additional foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2011. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.0 million and $400 million, respectively, and the related fair values were a liability of $7.3 million and $20.8 million, respectively. During 2010 and 2009, inclusive of losses of $21.1 million and $20.8 million, respectively, on these undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange (losses) and gains of approximately ($9.9) million and $1.7 million, respectively. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2010, 2009 and 2008 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. Historically, we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on managements best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. In October 2009, the FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards are required to be effective by no later than the first quarter of 2011 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted both of these standards effective January 1, 2010. Our adoption of these standards did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance requiring supplemental fair value disclosures and providing several clarifications regarding existing disclosure requirements. Specifically, the new guidance requires an 60 Table of Contents entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the new standard requires a gross presentation of the Level 3 rollforward, stating separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. The new guidance also provides clarification regarding the appropriate level of disaggregation of assets and liabilities for the purpose of fair value disclosures as well as the requirement to provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 measurements. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2010 and have presented the required information in Note 10 in our consolidated financial statements included herein. In December 2010, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring that Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test be performed for reporting units whose carrying value is zero or negative. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In December 2010, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying some of the disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. Specifically, the guidance states that, if comparative financial statements are presented, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. Additionally, the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This guidance will be effective January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. However, it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in Part I, in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. 61 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain salary payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses, including salaries. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the notional value of these contracts was $2,160.0 million and $810.0 million, respectively. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2010 are scheduled to mature each month during 2011, 2012, and 2013. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was $32.3 million and $19.0 million, respectively. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2010, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $205.3 million. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange rate gains or losses upon the remeasurement of the underlying Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts, scheduled to mature in 2011, to buy U.S. dollars and sell Indian rupees. At December 31, 2010, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.0 million and the related fair value was a liability of $7.3 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2010, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $23.8 million. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2010, 2009 and 2008 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2,226.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As of December 31, 2010, our short term investments totaled $685.4 million. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies, debt issuances by foreign governments and supranational entities, asset backed securities, and bank time deposits. 62 Table of Contents
