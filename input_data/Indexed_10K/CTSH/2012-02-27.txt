Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2011, our revenues increased to $6,121.2 million compared to $4,592.4 million in 2010. Net income increased to $883.6 million or $2.85 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.22 per diluted share during 2011. This is compared to net income of $733.5 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, net of tax, of $0.14 per diluted share during 2010. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2011 were as follows: strong performance across all business segments with revenue growth ranging from 26.1% for our Other segment to 40.9% for Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics as compared to 2010; continued penetration of the European market where we experienced revenue growth of 28.3% as compared to 2010; increased customer spending on discretionary development projects; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, including application maintenance, complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing, or BPO, and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 785 active clients compared to approximately 712 as of December 31, 2010 and increased the number of strategic clients by 25 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 191. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 16.3% and 27.7%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2011 as compared to 17.9% and 30.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time. Our revenue from European customers increased by 28.3% to approximately $1,097.5 million in 2011 compared to approximately $855.6 million in 2010. Revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $102.3 million from approximately $296.3 million in 2010 to approximately $398.6 million in 2011 and revenue from the UK increased by approximately $139.6 million from approximately $559.3 million in 2010 to approximately $698.9 million in 2011. In 2012, as a result of the ongoing uncertainty in the European economy, we expect Europe to grow at a slower rate than the rest of the company. We believe that Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region as well as the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports indicate that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed $87 billion at the end of NASSCOMs fiscal year 2012. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 15% over the prior fiscal year. According to the latest NASSCOM Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India report, global changes and new megatrends within economic, demographic, business, social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of $175 billion by 2020. 46 Table of Contents In 2011, our operating margin decreased slightly to 18.6% compared to 18.8% in 2010. Excluding stock based compensation expense of approximately $90.2 million, operating margin in 2011 was 20.0%. This was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Operating margin was affected by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including stock based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, including expanded sales and marketing activities partially offset by the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and any related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings; strengthening our business analytic capabilities; strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For the year ending December 31, 2012, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 137,700, which is an increase of approximately 33,700 over the prior year. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2011. Annual turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 13.2% for 2011. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, in India which may continue in the future; however, historically, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels, and achieving other operating efficiencies. Our current India real estate development program includes planned construction of an additional 10.5 million square feet of new space between 2011 and the end of 2015. The expanded program includes the expenditure of over $700.0 million during this period on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new company owned state of the art IT development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs, located in India. During 2012, including the Indian real estate development program, we expect to spend approximately $370 million globally for capital expenditures. At December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,432.3 million and working capital of $2,875.8 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2011 and 2010, we repurchased approximately $338.8 million and $41.9 million, respectively, of our Class A common stock under our existing stock repurchase program. Stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital. While several measures have indicated that the economy is stabilizing, we believe the global economic environment remains fragile. During 2012, barring any unforeseen events, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Continued focus by customers on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; Demand from our customers to help them achieve their dual mandate of simultaneously achieving cost savings while investing in innovation; Secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes; 47 Table of Contents Volatility in foreign currency rates; and Continued uncertainty in the world economy, particularly in Europe. In response to this fragile macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings; Partner with our existing customers to provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Continue to increase our strategic customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that may improve our overall service delivery capabilities, expand our geographic presence and or enable us to enter new areas of technology; Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure; and Continue to locate most of our new development center facilities in tax incentivized areas. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation awards and derivative financial investments, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed price contracts, are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial. 48 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation. Utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. In addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. We are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate and changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate. The consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on non recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest, which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Cognizant India, are primarily export oriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the Indian government for export activities. These benefits for export activities conducted within STPs expired on March 31, 2011. The income of our STPs is now subject to corporate income tax at the current rate of 32.4%. The expiration of the income tax holiday for STPs is the primary driver of the significant increase in our effective tax rate for 2011. We have constructed and expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in SEZs, which are entitled to certain income tax incentives for export activities for periods up to 15 years. Effective April 1, 2011, all Indian profits, including those generated within SEZs, are subject to the MAT, at the current rate of approximately 20.0%. Any MAT paid is creditable against future corporate income taxes, subject to limitations. Currently, we anticipate utilizing our existing MAT balances against future corporate income tax. However, our ability to fully do so will depend on possible changes to the Indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of Cognizant India. Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. This model utilizes various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, and credit risk factors. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 49 Table of Contents Investments. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits and U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, foreign governments and supranational entities and asset backed securities. The asset backed securities include securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, and other receivables and are rated AAA/Aaa. The years of issuance of our asset backed securities fall in the 2002 to 2011 range. We utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio. To the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices on similar assets (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets, valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (Level 3). Valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies. We periodically evaluate if unrealized losses, as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above, on individual securities classified as available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other than temporary. The analysis of other than temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions, including, but not limited to, the length of time an investments book value is greater than fair value, the severity of the investments decline, any credit deterioration of the investment, whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. Based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill, there are no significant risks of impairment. As of December 31, 2011, our goodwill balance was $288.8 million. Long Lived Assets and Intangibles. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our development and delivery centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration 50 Table of Contents programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2011: (Dollars in thousands) 2011 % ofRevenues 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 Revenues $ 6,121,156 100.0 $ 4,592,389 100.0 $ 3,278,663 100.0 $ 1,528,767 $ 1,313,726 Cost of revenues(1) 3,538,622 57.8 2,654,569 57.8 1,849,443 56.4 884,053 805,126 Selling, general and administrative(2) 1,328,665 21.7 972,093 21.2 721,359 22.0 356,572 250,734 Depreciation and amortization 117,401 1.9 103,875 2.3 89,371 2.7 13,526 14,504 Income from operations 1,136,468 18.6 861,852 18.8 618,490 18.9 274,616 243,362 Other income (expense), net 32,681 16,728 18,461 15,953 (1,733 ) Provision for income taxes 285,531 145,040 101,988 140,491 43,052 Net income $ 883,618 14.4 $ 733,540 16.0 $ 534,963 16.3 $ 150,078 $ 198,577 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $15,257, $13,147, and $14,889 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $187 for the year ended December 31, 2009, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $74,975, $43,837, and $29,927 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $758 for the year ended December 31, 2009, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax, which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009, retroactive to April 1, 51 Table of Contents 2009, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stock based compensation expense, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations excludes stock based compensation expense, which is recurring. Stock based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2011 % ofRevenues 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 1,136,468 18.6 $ 861,852 18.8 $ 618,490 18.9 Add: stock based compensation expense 90,232 1.4 56,984 1.2 44,816 1.4 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 945 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 1,226,700 20.0 $ 918,836 20.0 $ 664,251 20.3 The fringe benefit tax regulation in India obligated us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. During the third quarter of 2009, the Indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to April 1, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue. Revenue increased by 33.3%, or approximately $1,528.8 million, from approximately $4,592.4 million during 2010 to approximately $6,121.2 million in 2011. This increase was primarily attributed 52 Table of Contents to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and increased customer spending on discretionary development projects. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2010 increased by approximately $1,371.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2011 was approximately $157.5 million or approximately 10.3% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2011 by $1,220.2 million and $241.9 million, respectively, as compared to 2010. We had approximately 785 active clients as of December 31, 2011 as compared to approximately 712 active clients as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $574.0 million and $445.0 million, respectively, of the $1,528.8 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 40.7% and 26.4%, respectively, compared to 2010 and represented approximately 50.9% and 49.1%, respectively, of total revenues in 2011. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues during 2011 or 2010. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employees benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 33.3% or $884.0 million from $2,654.6 million during 2010 to $3,538.6 million in 2011. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately $821.8 million, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel necessary to support our revenue growth. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 34.4% or $370.1 million, from $1,076.0 million during 2010, to $1,446.1 million during 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenue from 23.4% in 2010 to 23.6% in 2011. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefit costs and investments to grow our business, including expanded sales and marketing activities. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 31.9%, or $274.6 million, from approximately $861.9 million during 2010 to approximately $1,136.5 million during 2011, representing operating margins of 18.6% of revenues in 2011 and 18.8% of revenues in 2010. The decrease in operating margin was attributed to an increase in compensation and benefit costs and investments to grow our business, including expanded sales and marketing activities. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 54 basis points or 0.54 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $90.2 million and $57.0 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 20.0% and 20.0%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2011, settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 31 basis points or 0.31 percentage points. 53 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange (losses) gains $ (32,400 ) $ 11,220 $ (43,620 ) Gains (losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments 23,621 (21,088 ) 44,709 Net foreign currency exchange (losses) (8,779 ) (9,868 ) 1,089 Interest income 39,249 25,793 13,456 Other, net 2,211 803 1,408 Total other income (expense), net $ 32,681 $ 16,728 $ 15,953 The foreign currency exchange losses of approximately $32.4 million were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $23.6 million of gains on foreign exchange forward contracts were primarily related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $234.2 million. The $13.5 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $145.0 million in 2010 to approximately $285.5 million in 2011. The effective income tax rate increased from 16.5% in 2010 to 24.4% in 2011. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the expiration of Indias STP tax holiday program in 2011. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $733.5 million in 2010 to approximately $883.6 million in 2011, representing 16.0% and 14.4% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2011 is primarily attributed to a higher effective income tax rate in 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue. Revenue increased by 40.1%, or approximately $1,313.7 million, from approximately $3,278.7 million during 2009 to approximately $4,592.4 million in 2010. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs, increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects, and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 increased by approximately $1,193.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2010 was approximately $120.4 million or approximately 9.2% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2010 by $988.5 million and $248.8 million, respectively, as compared to 2009. We had approximately 712 active clients as of December 31, 2010 as compared to approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009. In addition, during 2010 we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately 54 Table of Contents $537.8 million and $316.7 million, respectively, of the $1,313.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 52.1% and 30.4%, respectively, compared to 2009 and represented approximately 48.3% and 51.7%, respectively, of total revenues in 2010. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues during 2010 or 2009. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 43.5% or $805.2 million from $1,849.4 million during 2009 to $2,654.6 million in 2010. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately $671.2 million, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel and incentive based compensation, as well as the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.7% or $265.2 million, from $810.7 million during 2009, to $1,075.9 million during 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 24.7% in 2009 to 23.4% in 2010. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 39.3%, or $243.4 million, from approximately $618.5 million during 2009 to approximately $861.9 million during 2010, representing operating margins of 18.8% of revenues in 2010 and 18.9% of revenues in 2009. The operating margin was impacted by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 157 basis points or 1.57 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $57.0 million and $44.8 million for 2010 and 2009 and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million in 2009, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 20.0% and 20.3%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2010, settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 91 basis points or 0.91 percentage points. 55 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains $ 11,220 $ 22,493 $ (11,273 ) (Losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (21,088 ) (20,821 ) (267 ) Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains (9,868 ) 1,672 (11,540 ) Interest income 25,793 15,895 9,898 Other, net 803 894 (91 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 16,728 $ 18,461 $ (1,733 ) The foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $11.2 million were primarily attributed to intercompany balances between our European subsidiaries and Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $21.1 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2010. At December 31, 2010, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $234.0 million. The $9.9 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $102.0 million in 2009 to approximately $145.0 million in 2010. The effective income tax rate increased from 16.0% in 2009 to 16.5% in 2010. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to discrete tax items in 2010, a higher U.S. state effective income tax rate in 2010, as well as an increase in our taxable income in India resulting from an increase in non export profits that are taxable at the India statutory rate. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $535.0 million in 2009 to approximately $733.5 million in 2010, representing 16.3% and 16.0% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2010 is primarily attributed to an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses and a higher effective income tax rate. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes information, media and entertainment services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are 56 Table of Contents subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers. Certain selling, general and administrative expenses, excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target, a portion of depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax, and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 785 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, or 2009. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are as follows: 2011 2010 2011 2010 2009 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 2,518,422 $ 1,944,450 $ 1,406,629 $ 573,972 29.5 $ 537,821 38.2 Healthcare 1,622,157 1,177,113 860,427 445,044 37.8 316,686 36.8 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 1,197,472 849,643 564,917 347,829 40.9 284,726 50.4 Other 783,105 621,183 446,690 161,922 26.1 174,493 39.1 Total revenues $ 6,121,156 $ 4,592,389 $ 3,278,663 $ 1,528,767 33.3 $ 1,313,726 40.1 Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 872,267 $ 668,595 $ 503,689 $ 203,672 30.5 $ 164,906 32.7 Healthcare 625,052 436,879 331,007 188,173 43.1 105,872 32.0 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 440,416 283,676 184,636 156,740 55.3 99,040 53.6 Other 254,145 208,306 147,246 45,839 22.0 61,060 41.5 Total segment operating profit $ 2,191,880 $ 1,597,456 $ 1,166,578 $ 594,424 37.2 $ 430,878 36.9 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Financial Services Segment Revenue.

Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,432.3 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers; continued development of new service lines; possible acquisitions of related businesses; formation of joint ventures; stock repurchases; and general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $2,875.8 million as compared to working capital of approximately $2,587.5 million as of December 31, 2010. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $875.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $764.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $672.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in both years is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade 60 Table of Contents accounts receivable increased from approximately $626.3 million at December 31, 2009 to approximately $901.3 million at December 31, 2010 and to approximately $1,179.0 million at December 31, 2011. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $83.0 million at December 31, 2009 to approximately $113.0 at December 31, 2010 and to approximately $139.6 million at December 31, 2011.

At December 31, 2009, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 72 days as compared to 71 days as of December 31, 2010 and 73 days as of December 31, 2011. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $850.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $446.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2011 is related to an increase in net purchases of investments, an increase in capital expenditures during the year and increased payments for acquisitions. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 as compared to 2009 related to an increase in capital expenditures during the year partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions and a decrease in net purchases of investments. Our financing activities used net cash of approximately $255.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and provided net cash of approximately $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2011 is primarily related to additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The increase in net cash provided by the financing activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 was related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans partially offset by additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2011, a majority of our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Most of the amounts held outside of the United States could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, other than amounts representing pre 2002 undistributed Indian earnings for which we have already accrued U.S. taxes, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our U.S. operations. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2011, 2010, and 2009 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of, or requirements for, capital resources. 61 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $240.1 million related to our India development center expansion program, which included expenditures for land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2011, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 510,092 $ 104,985 $ 185,294 $ 138,565 $ 81,248 Fixed capital commitments(1) 240,134 240,134 Other purchase commitments(2) 23,714 23,714 Total $ 773,940 $ 368,833 $ 185,294 $ 138,565 $ 81,248 (1) Relates to our India development and delivery center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. As of December 31, 2011, we had $56.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customers confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 78.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 62 Table of Contents 33.2% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2011, are denominated in the Indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2011 and 2010, we reported foreign currency exchange (losses) and gains, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately ($32.4) million and $11.2 million, respectively, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily the Indian rupee. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses. These hedges to buy Indian rupees and sell U.S. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. During 2011 and 2010, we recorded income of $18.8 million and $41.6 million, respectively, on contracts that settled during each year. As of December 31, 2011, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $1,193.5 million and a weighted average forward rate of 49.1 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2012, outstanding contracts with a notional value of $1,080.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 50.4 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2013, outstanding contracts with a notional value of $810.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 52.7 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2014, and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $420.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 54.3 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2015. Our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2012 which are primarily used to hedge our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2011, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.2 million and the related fair value was an asset of $30.7 million. During 2011, inclusive of gains of $23.6 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange (losses) of approximately ($8.8) million. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. Historically, we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new guidance clarifying certain disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. Specifically, the guidance states that, if comparative financial statements are presented, the entity should 63 Table of Contents disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. Additionally, the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. However, it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis. In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance, which requires that comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements, thus eliminating the option of presenting the components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, the new guidance requires that the reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB deferred the new requirements related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The requirement to present comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements has not been deferred and will be effective on a retrospective basis for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. The adoption of this standard affects financial statement presentation only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. This standard allows, but does not require, an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The new standard gives an entity the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012 and will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures related to the nature of an entitys rights to offset and any related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard affects financial statement disclosures only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other 64 Table of Contents variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in Part I, in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the notional value of these contracts was $3,503.5 million and $2,160.0 million, respectively. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2011 are scheduled to mature each month during 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the net unrealized (loss) gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was ($385.6) million and $32.3 million, respectively. The change in the net unrealized gain (loss) position from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 was attributed to the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar in the latter part of 2011. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $291.1 million. Our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2012 which are primarily used to hedge our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2011, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.2 million and the related fair value was an asset of $30.7 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $18.6 million. 65 Table of Contents There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2011, 2010 and 2009 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2,432.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As of December 31, 2011, our short term investments totaled $1,121.4 million. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits and U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies, debt issuances by foreign governments and supranational entities and asset backed securities. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Summary In 2011, our revenues increased to $6,121.2 million compared to $4,592.4 million in 2010. Net income increased to $883.6 million or $2.85 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense, net of tax, equal to $0.22 per diluted share during 2011. This is compared to net income of $733.5 million, or $2.37 per diluted share, including stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, net of tax, of $0.14 per diluted share during 2010. The key drivers of our revenue growth in 2011 were as follows: strong performance across all business segments with revenue growth ranging from 26.1% for our Other segment to 40.9% for Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics as compared to 2010; continued penetration of the European market where we experienced revenue growth of 28.3% as compared to 2010; increased customer spending on discretionary development projects; expansion of our service offerings, which enabled us to cross sell new services to our customers and meet the rapidly growing demand for complex large scale outsourcing solutions; increased penetration at existing customers, including strategic customers; and continued expansion of the market for global delivery of IT services and business process outsourcing. We saw a continued demand from our customers for a broad range of IT solutions, including application maintenance, complex systems development engagements, testing, enterprise resource planning, or ERP, infrastructure management, business process outsourcing, or BPO, and business intelligence. We finished the year with approximately 785 active clients compared to approximately 712 as of December 31, 2010 and increased the number of strategic clients by 25 during the year bringing the total number of our strategic clients to 191. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Our top five and top ten customers accounted for 16.3% and 27.7%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2011 as compared to 17.9% and 30.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2010. As we continue to add new customers and increase our penetration at existing customers, we expect the percentage of revenues from our top five and top ten customers to decline over time. Our revenue from European customers increased by 28.3% to approximately $1,097.5 million in 2011 compared to approximately $855.6 million in 2010. Revenue from Europe, excluding the UK, increased by approximately $102.3 million from approximately $296.3 million in 2010 to approximately $398.6 million in 2011 and revenue from the UK increased by approximately $139.6 million from approximately $559.3 million in 2010 to approximately $698.9 million in 2011. In 2012, as a result of the ongoing uncertainty in the European economy, we expect Europe to grow at a slower rate than the rest of the company. We believe that Europe will continue to be an area of significant investment for us as we see this region as well as the Middle East and the Asia Pacific regions, particularly Japan, India, Australia and Singapore, as growth opportunities for the long term. Our revenue growth is also attributed to increasing market acceptance of, and strong demand for, offshore IT software and services and business process outsourcing. NASSCOM (Indias National Association of Software and Service Companies) reports indicate that Indias IT software and services and business process outsourcing sectors are expected to exceed $87 billion at the end of NASSCOMs fiscal year 2012. This is an expected growth rate of approximately 15% over the prior fiscal year. According to the latest NASSCOM Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India report, global changes and new megatrends within economic, demographic, business, social and environmental areas are set to expand the outsourcing industry by creating new dynamics and opportunities and are expected to result in export revenues of $175 billion by 2020. 46 Table of Contents In 2011, our operating margin decreased slightly to 18.6% compared to 18.8% in 2010. Excluding stock based compensation expense of approximately $90.2 million, operating margin in 2011 was 20.0%. This was in line with our historic targeted operating margin range, excluding stock based compensation costs and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of total revenues. Operating margin was affected by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including stock based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, including expanded sales and marketing activities partially offset by the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Historically, we have invested our profitability above the 19% to 20% operating margin level, which excludes stock based compensation and any related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, back into our business, which we believe is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings; strengthening our business analytic capabilities; strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; and recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees. In addition, this investment includes maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our customer requests to take on additional projects. For the year ending December 31, 2012, we expect to continue to invest amounts in excess of our targeted operating margin levels back into the business. We finished the year with total headcount of approximately 137,700, which is an increase of approximately 33,700 over the prior year. The increase in the number of our technical personnel and the related infrastructure costs, to meet the demand for our services, is the primary driver of the increase in our operating expenses in 2011. Annual turnover, including both voluntary and involuntary, was approximately 13.2% for 2011. The majority of our turnover occurs in India. As a result, annualized attrition rates on site at clients are below our global attrition rate. In addition, attrition is weighted towards the more junior members of our staff. We have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, in India which may continue in the future; however, historically, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels, and achieving other operating efficiencies. Our current India real estate development program includes planned construction of an additional 10.5 million square feet of new space between 2011 and the end of 2015. The expanded program includes the expenditure of over $700.0 million during this period on land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new company owned state of the art IT development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as Special Economic Zones, or SEZs, located in India. During 2012, including the Indian real estate development program, we expect to spend approximately $370 million globally for capital expenditures. At December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,432.3 million and working capital of $2,875.8 million. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. During 2011 and 2010, we repurchased approximately $338.8 million and $41.9 million, respectively, of our Class A common stock under our existing stock repurchase program. Stock repurchases under this program were funded from working capital. While several measures have indicated that the economy is stabilizing, we believe the global economic environment remains fragile. During 2012, barring any unforeseen events, we expect the following factors to affect our business and our operating results: Continued focus by customers on directing IT spending towards cost containment projects, such as application maintenance, infrastructure management and BPO; Demand from our customers to help them achieve their dual mandate of simultaneously achieving cost savings while investing in innovation; Secular changes driven by evolving technologies and regulatory changes; 47 Table of Contents Volatility in foreign currency rates; and Continued uncertainty in the world economy, particularly in Europe. In response to this fragile macroeconomic environment, we plan to: Continue to invest in our talent base and new service offerings; Partner with our existing customers to provide innovative solutions resulting in our garnering an increased portion of our customers overall IT spend; Continue our focus on growing our business in Europe, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region, where we believe there are opportunities to gain market share; Continue to increase our strategic customer base across all of our business segments; Opportunistically look for acquisitions that may improve our overall service delivery capabilities, expand our geographic presence and or enable us to enter new areas of technology; Continue operating focus and discipline to appropriately manage our cost structure; and Continue to locate most of our new development center facilities in tax incentivized areas. Critical Accounting Estimates and Risks Managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our accompanying consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities, including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on going basis, we evaluate our estimates. The most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain fixed bid contracts, the allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, valuation of investments, goodwill and other long lived assets, assumptions used in valuing stock based compensation awards and derivative financial investments, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting policies require a higher level of management judgments and estimates than others in preparing the consolidated financial statements: Revenue Recognition. Revenues related to our highly complex information technology application development contracts, which are predominantly fixed price contracts, are recognized as the services are performed using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Under this method, total contract revenue during the term of an agreement is recognized on the basis of the percentage that each contracts total labor cost to date bears to the total expected labor cost (cost to cost method). This method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made. Management reviews total expected labor costs on an ongoing basis. Revisions to our estimates may result in increases or decreases to revenues and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified. If our estimates indicate that a contract loss will be incurred, a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. Contract losses for the periods presented were immaterial. 48 Table of Contents Stock Based Compensation. Utilizing the fair value recognition provisions prescribed by the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised, the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. In addition, for performance stock units, we are required to estimate the most probable outcome of the performance conditions in order to determine the amount of stock compensation costs to be recorded over the vesting period. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, deferred income tax assets (and related valuation allowance, if any) and liabilities requires significant judgment. We are required to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate and changes in the geographic mix of income before taxes or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate. The consolidated provision for income taxes may also change period to period based on non recurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. Our provision for income taxes also includes the impact of provisions established for uncertain income tax positions, as well as the related net interest, which can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not differ from our recorded amounts. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact recorded to income tax expense in the period in which such determination was made. Our Indian subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Cognizant India, are primarily export oriented and are eligible for certain income tax holiday benefits granted by the Indian government for export activities. These benefits for export activities conducted within STPs expired on March 31, 2011. The income of our STPs is now subject to corporate income tax at the current rate of 32.4%. The expiration of the income tax holiday for STPs is the primary driver of the significant increase in our effective tax rate for 2011. We have constructed and expect to continue to locate most of our newer development facilities in SEZs, which are entitled to certain income tax incentives for export activities for periods up to 15 years. Effective April 1, 2011, all Indian profits, including those generated within SEZs, are subject to the MAT, at the current rate of approximately 20.0%. Any MAT paid is creditable against future corporate income taxes, subject to limitations. Currently, we anticipate utilizing our existing MAT balances against future corporate income tax. However, our ability to fully do so will depend on possible changes to the Indian tax laws as well as the future financial results of Cognizant India. Derivative Financial Instruments. Derivative financial instruments are accounted for in accordance with the authoritative guidance which requires that each derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Our derivative financial instruments consist of foreign exchange forward contracts. We estimate the fair value of each foreign exchange forward contract by using a present value of expected cash flows model. This model utilizes various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, and credit risk factors. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 49 Table of Contents Investments. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits and U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, foreign governments and supranational entities and asset backed securities. The asset backed securities include securities backed by auto loans, credit card receivables, and other receivables and are rated AAA/Aaa. The years of issuance of our asset backed securities fall in the 2002 to 2011 range. We utilize various inputs to determine the fair value of our investment portfolio. To the extent they exist, unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets in active markets (Level 1) or quoted prices on similar assets (Level 2) are utilized to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio. In the absence of quoted prices or liquid markets, valuation techniques would be used to determine fair value of any investments that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (Level 3). Valuation techniques are based on various assumptions, including, but not limited to timing and amounts of cash flows, discount rates, rate of return, and adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing investments using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a positive or negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our security valuation methodologies. We periodically evaluate if unrealized losses, as determined based on the security valuation methodologies discussed above, on individual securities classified as available for sale in the investment portfolio are considered to be other than temporary. The analysis of other than temporary impairment requires the use of various assumptions, including, but not limited to, the length of time an investments book value is greater than fair value, the severity of the investments decline, any credit deterioration of the investment, whether management intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is generally recorded to income and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the relative credit worthiness of each customer, historical collections experience and other information, including the aging of the receivables. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or as circumstances warrant. When determining the fair value of our reporting units, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows. Any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge. Based upon our most recent evaluation of goodwill, there are no significant risks of impairment. As of December 31, 2011, our goodwill balance was $288.8 million. Long Lived Assets and Intangibles. We review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In general, we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset. The measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset. If such assets were determined to be impaired, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks. The majority of our development and delivery centers, including a majority of our employees, are located in India. As a result, we may be subject to certain risks associated with international operations, including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and risks associated with the application and imposition of protective legislation and regulations relating to import and export or otherwise resulting from foreign policy or the variability of foreign economic or political conditions. Additional risks associated with international operations include difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights, limitations on immigration 50 Table of Contents programs, the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, potential geo political and other risks associated with terrorist activities and local and cross border conflicts, and potentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, quotas and other barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with our overall compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The inability of our management to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for future year ends could result in adverse consequences to us, including, but not limited to, a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data expressed for the three years ended December 31, 2011: (Dollars in thousands) 2011 % ofRevenues 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues Increase (Decrease) 2011 2010 Revenues $ 6,121,156 100.0 $ 4,592,389 100.0 $ 3,278,663 100.0 $ 1,528,767 $ 1,313,726 Cost of revenues(1) 3,538,622 57.8 2,654,569 57.8 1,849,443 56.4 884,053 805,126 Selling, general and administrative(2) 1,328,665 21.7 972,093 21.2 721,359 22.0 356,572 250,734 Depreciation and amortization 117,401 1.9 103,875 2.3 89,371 2.7 13,526 14,504 Income from operations 1,136,468 18.6 861,852 18.8 618,490 18.9 274,616 243,362 Other income (expense), net 32,681 16,728 18,461 15,953 (1,733 ) Provision for income taxes 285,531 145,040 101,988 140,491 43,052 Net income $ 883,618 14.4 $ 733,540 16.0 $ 534,963 16.3 $ 150,078 $ 198,577 (1) Includes stock based compensation expense of $15,257, $13,147, and $14,889 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $187 for the year ended December 31, 2009, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. (2) Includes stock based compensation expense of $74,975, $43,837, and $29,927 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $758 for the year ended December 31, 2009, and is exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense. The following table includes non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, a measure defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a non GAAP financial measure. This non GAAP financial measure is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, this non GAAP measure, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations of our GAAP financial statements to such non GAAP measure should be carefully evaluated. We seek to manage the company to a targeted operating margin, excluding stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, of 19% to 20% of revenues. Accordingly, we believe that non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax, which was repealed during the third quarter of 2009, retroactive to April 1, 51 Table of Contents 2009, is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate our financial performance. For our internal management reporting and budgeting purposes, we use financial statements that do not include stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense for financial and operational decision making, to evaluate period to period comparisons and for making comparisons of our operating results to that of our competitors. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use to account for stock based compensation expense, we believe that providing a non GAAP financial measure that excludes stock based compensation expense and applicable stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of other companies. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of non GAAP income from operations when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP income from operations can provide useful supplemental information to our management and to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. A limitation of using non GAAP income from operations versus income from operations reported in accordance with GAAP is that non GAAP income from operations excludes stock based compensation expense, which is recurring. Stock based compensation expense will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. In addition, other companies may calculate non GAAP financial measures differently than us, thereby limiting the usefulness of this non GAAP financial measure as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non GAAP income from operations and evaluating such non GAAP financial measures with financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of income from operations as reported and non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense, is as follows for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2011 % ofRevenues 2010 % ofRevenues 2009 % ofRevenues Income from operations, as reported $ 1,136,468 18.6 $ 861,852 18.8 $ 618,490 18.9 Add: stock based compensation expense 90,232 1.4 56,984 1.2 44,816 1.4 Add: stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense 945 Non GAAP income from operations, excluding stock based compensation expense and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense $ 1,226,700 20.0 $ 918,836 20.0 $ 664,251 20.3 The fringe benefit tax regulation in India obligated us to pay, upon exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award, a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to date of vest. There was no cash cost to us as we recovered the cost of the Indian fringe benefit tax from the employees proceeds from the award. Under U.S. GAAP, the stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related recovery of such tax from our employee is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award. During the third quarter of 2009, the Indian government repealed the fringe benefit tax retroactive to April 1, 2009. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue. Revenue increased by 33.3%, or approximately $1,528.8 million, from approximately $4,592.4 million during 2010 to approximately $6,121.2 million in 2011. This increase was primarily attributed 52 Table of Contents to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs and increased customer spending on discretionary development projects. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2010 increased by approximately $1,371.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2011 was approximately $157.5 million or approximately 10.3% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2011 by $1,220.2 million and $241.9 million, respectively, as compared to 2010. We had approximately 785 active clients as of December 31, 2011 as compared to approximately 712 active clients as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately $574.0 million and $445.0 million, respectively, of the $1,528.8 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 40.7% and 26.4%, respectively, compared to 2010 and represented approximately 50.9% and 49.1%, respectively, of total revenues in 2011. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues during 2011 or 2010. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employees benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 33.3% or $884.0 million from $2,654.6 million during 2010 to $3,538.6 million in 2011. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately $821.8 million, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel necessary to support our revenue growth. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 34.4% or $370.1 million, from $1,076.0 million during 2010, to $1,446.1 million during 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenue from 23.4% in 2010 to 23.6% in 2011. The increase as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to increases in compensation and benefit costs and investments to grow our business, including expanded sales and marketing activities. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 31.9%, or $274.6 million, from approximately $861.9 million during 2010 to approximately $1,136.5 million during 2011, representing operating margins of 18.6% of revenues in 2011 and 18.8% of revenues in 2010. The decrease in operating margin was attributed to an increase in compensation and benefit costs and investments to grow our business, including expanded sales and marketing activities. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar positively impacted our operating margin by approximately 54 basis points or 0.54 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $90.2 million and $57.0 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were 20.0% and 20.0%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2011, settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 31 basis points or 0.31 percentage points. 53 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange (losses) gains $ (32,400 ) $ 11,220 $ (43,620 ) Gains (losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments 23,621 (21,088 ) 44,709 Net foreign currency exchange (losses) (8,779 ) (9,868 ) 1,089 Interest income 39,249 25,793 13,456 Other, net 2,211 803 1,408 Total other income (expense), net $ 32,681 $ 16,728 $ 15,953 The foreign currency exchange losses of approximately $32.4 million were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $23.6 million of gains on foreign exchange forward contracts were primarily related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the notional value of our undesignated hedges was $234.2 million. The $13.5 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $145.0 million in 2010 to approximately $285.5 million in 2011. The effective income tax rate increased from 16.5% in 2010 to 24.4% in 2011. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to the expiration of Indias STP tax holiday program in 2011. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $733.5 million in 2010 to approximately $883.6 million in 2011, representing 16.0% and 14.4% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2011 is primarily attributed to a higher effective income tax rate in 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Revenue. Revenue increased by 40.1%, or approximately $1,313.7 million, from approximately $3,278.7 million during 2009 to approximately $4,592.4 million in 2010. This increase was primarily attributed to greater acceptance of the global delivery model among an increasing number of industries, continued interest in using the global delivery model as a means to reduce overall IT costs, increased customer spending on post acquisition integration engagements and discretionary development projects, and greater penetration in the European market. Revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 increased by approximately $1,193.3 million and revenue from new customers added during 2010 was approximately $120.4 million or approximately 9.2% of the year over year revenue increase and 2.6% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, revenue from our North American and European customers increased in 2010 by $988.5 million and $248.8 million, respectively, as compared to 2009. We had approximately 712 active clients as of December 31, 2010 as compared to approximately 589 active clients as of December 31, 2009. In addition, during 2010 we experienced strong demand across all of our business segments for an increasingly broad range of services. Our Financial Services and Healthcare business segments accounted for approximately 54 Table of Contents $537.8 million and $316.7 million, respectively, of the $1,313.7 million increase in revenue. Additionally, our IT consulting and technology services and IT outsourcing revenues increased by approximately 52.1% and 30.4%, respectively, compared to 2009 and represented approximately 48.3% and 51.7%, respectively, of total revenues in 2010. No customer accounted for sales in excess of 10% of revenues during 2010 or 2009. Cost of Revenues (Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization Expense). Our cost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, benefits, immigration and project related travel for technical personnel, subcontracting and sales commissions related to revenues. Our cost of revenues increased by approximately 43.5% or $805.2 million from $1,849.4 million during 2009 to $2,654.6 million in 2010. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits costs of approximately $671.2 million, resulting from the increase in the number of our technical personnel and incentive based compensation, as well as the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, incentive based compensation, stock based compensation expense, payroll taxes, employee benefits, travel, promotion, communications, management, finance, administrative and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including depreciation and amortization, increased by approximately 32.7% or $265.2 million, from $810.7 million during 2009, to $1,075.9 million during 2010, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from 24.7% in 2009 to 23.4% in 2010. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to economies of scale driven by increased revenues that resulted from our expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization, partially offset by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Income from Operations. Income from operations increased approximately 39.3%, or $243.4 million, from approximately $618.5 million during 2009 to approximately $861.9 million during 2010, representing operating margins of 18.8% of revenues in 2010 and 18.9% of revenues in 2009. The operating margin was impacted by an increase in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation costs, and investments to grow our business, partially offset by expanded sales and marketing activities in the current and prior years that allowed us to leverage our cost structure over a larger organization. Excluding the impact of applicable designated cash flow hedges, the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our operating margin by approximately 157 basis points or 1.57 percentage points. Each additional 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will have the effect of moving our operating margin by approximately 27 basis points or 0.27 percentage points. Excluding stock based compensation expense of $57.0 million and $44.8 million for 2010 and 2009 and stock based Indian fringe benefit tax expense of $0.9 million in 2009, operating margins for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were 20.0% and 20.3%, respectively. We entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These hedges are intended to mitigate the volatility of the changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Indian rupee. During 2010, settlement of certain cash flow hedges favorably impacted our operating margin by approximately 91 basis points or 0.91 percentage points. 55 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net. Total other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) and interest income. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, Total other income (expense), net: (Dollars in thousands) 2010 2009 Increase/(Decrease) Foreign currency exchange gains $ 11,220 $ 22,493 $ (11,273 ) (Losses) on foreign exchange forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments (21,088 ) (20,821 ) (267 ) Net foreign currency exchange (losses) gains (9,868 ) 1,672 (11,540 ) Interest income 25,793 15,895 9,898 Other, net 803 894 (91 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 16,728 $ 18,461 $ (1,733 ) The foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $11.2 million were primarily attributed to intercompany balances between our European subsidiaries and Cognizant India for services performed by Cognizant India on behalf of our European customers and the remeasurement of the Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. The $21.1 million of losses on foreign exchange forward contracts were related to the change in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts entered into to offset foreign currency exposure to Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets and the realized losses related to the settlement of certain foreign exchange forward contracts in 2010. At December 31, 2010, the notional value of these undesignated hedges was $234.0 million. The $9.9 million increase in interest income was primarily attributed to higher invested balances. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased from approximately $102.0 million in 2009 to approximately $145.0 million in 2010. The effective income tax rate increased from 16.0% in 2009 to 16.5% in 2010. The increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributed to discrete tax items in 2010, a higher U.S. state effective income tax rate in 2010, as well as an increase in our taxable income in India resulting from an increase in non export profits that are taxable at the India statutory rate. Net Income. Net income increased from approximately $535.0 million in 2009 to approximately $733.5 million in 2010, representing 16.3% and 16.0% of revenues, respectively. The decrease in net income as a percentage of revenues in 2010 is primarily attributed to an increase in net foreign currency exchange losses and a higher effective income tax rate. Results by Business Segment Our reportable segments are: Financial Services, which includes customers providing banking / transaction processing, capital markets and insurance services; Healthcare, which includes healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences customers; Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, which includes manufacturers, retailers, travel and other hospitality customers, as well as customers providing logistics services; and Other, which is an aggregation of industry operating segments which, individually, are less than 10.0% of consolidated revenues and segment operating profit. The Other segment includes information, media and entertainment services, communications, and high technology operating segments. Our sales managers, account executives, account managers and project teams are aligned in accordance with the specific industries they serve. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates Cognizants performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as income from operations before unallocated costs. Generally, operating expenses for each operating segment have similar characteristics and are 56 Table of Contents subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on industries served by our operating groups may affect revenue and operating expenses to differing degrees. Expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling and delivery costs as well as a per seat charge for use of the development and delivery centers. Certain selling, general and administrative expenses, excess or shortfall of incentive compensation for delivery personnel as compared to target, a portion of depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense and the related stock based Indian fringe benefit tax, and the impact of the settlements of our cash flow hedges are not allocated to individual segments in internal management reports used by the chief operating decision maker. Accordingly, such expenses are excluded from segment operating profit. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 785 active customers. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, or 2009. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. Revenues from external customers and segment operating profit, before unallocated expenses, for the Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, and Other segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are as follows: 2011 2010 2011 2010 2009 Increase % Increase % (Dollars in thousands) Revenues: Financial Services $ 2,518,422 $ 1,944,450 $ 1,406,629 $ 573,972 29.5 $ 537,821 38.2 Healthcare 1,622,157 1,177,113 860,427 445,044 37.8 316,686 36.8 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 1,197,472 849,643 564,917 347,829 40.9 284,726 50.4 Other 783,105 621,183 446,690 161,922 26.1 174,493 39.1 Total revenues $ 6,121,156 $ 4,592,389 $ 3,278,663 $ 1,528,767 33.3 $ 1,313,726 40.1 Segment Operating Profit: Financial Services $ 872,267 $ 668,595 $ 503,689 $ 203,672 30.5 $ 164,906 32.7 Healthcare 625,052 436,879 331,007 188,173 43.1 105,872 32.0 Manufacturing/Retail/ Logistics 440,416 283,676 184,636 156,740 55.3 99,040 53.6 Other 254,145 208,306 147,246 45,839 22.0 61,060 41.5 Total segment operating profit $ 2,191,880 $ 1,597,456 $ 1,166,578 $ 594,424 37.2 $ 430,878 36.9 Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Financial Services Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 29.5%, or approximately $573.9 million, from approximately $1,944.5 million during 2010 to approximately $2,518.4 million in 2011. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2010 and customers added during 2011 was approximately $531.3 million and approximately $42.6 million, respectively. Within the segment, revenue from our banking and insurance customers increased approximately $395.7 million and $178.2 57 Table of Contents million, respectively, over the prior year. Overall, the full year 2011 increase in the segment can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model and increased customer spending on discretionary development projects. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased by 30.5%, or approximately $203.7 million, from approximately $668.6 million during 2010 to approximately $872.3 million during 2011. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues during the year. Healthcare Segment Revenue. Revenue increased by 37.8%, or approximately $445.0 million, from approximately $1,177.1 million during 2010 to approximately $1,622.2 million in 2011. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers.

The increase in revenue was primarily driven by continued expansion of existing customer relationships as well as revenue contributed by new customers. The increase in revenue from customers existing as of December 31, 2009 and customers added during 2010 was approximately $149.6 million and approximately $24.9 million, respectively. Within the Other segment, growth was particularly strong among both our information, media and entertainment services customers and our telecommunication customers, where revenue during 2010 increased approximately $74.1 million and $56.6 million, respectively. The increase can also be attributed to leveraging sales and marketing investments in this business segment as well as greater acceptance of our global services delivery model and increase in discretionary development projects. Segment Operating Profit. Segment operating profit increased 41.5%, or approximately $61.1 million, from approximately $147.2 million in 2009 to approximately $208.3 million in 2010. The increase in segment operating profit was attributable primarily to increased revenues during the year and achieving operating efficiencies, including continual leverage of prior sales and marketing investments, partially offset by additional headcount to support our revenue growth, an increase in compensation and benefit costs and the impact of the appreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of $2,432.3 million. We have used, and plan to use, such cash for expansion of existing operations, including our offshore development and delivery centers; continued development of new service lines; possible acquisitions of related businesses; formation of joint ventures; stock repurchases; and general corporate purposes, including working capital. As of December 31, 2011, we had no third party debt and had working capital of approximately $2,875.8 million as compared to working capital of approximately $2,587.5 million as of December 31, 2010. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any near term liquidity issues. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $875.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $764.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $672.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in both years is primarily attributed to the increase in our net income. Trade 60 Table of Contents accounts receivable increased from approximately $626.3 million at December 31, 2009 to approximately $901.3 million at December 31, 2010 and to approximately $1,179.0 million at December 31, 2011. Unbilled accounts receivable increased from approximately $83.0 million at December 31, 2009 to approximately $113.0 at December 31, 2010 and to approximately $139.6 million at December 31, 2011. The increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables during 2011 was due primarily to increased revenues. We monitor turnover, aging and the collection of accounts receivable through the use of management reports that are prepared on a customer basis and evaluated by our finance staff. At December 31, 2009, our days sales outstanding, including unbilled receivables, was approximately 72 days as compared to 71 days as of December 31, 2010 and 73 days as of December 31, 2011. Our investing activities used net cash of approximately $850.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, $446.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $394.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2011 is related to an increase in net purchases of investments, an increase in capital expenditures during the year and increased payments for acquisitions. The increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2010 as compared to 2009 related to an increase in capital expenditures during the year partially offset by decreased payments for acquisitions and a decrease in net purchases of investments. Our financing activities used net cash of approximately $255.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and provided net cash of approximately $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 and $76.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net cash used in financing activities in 2011 is primarily related to additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. The increase in net cash provided by the financing activities in 2010 as compared to 2009 was related to additional proceeds and excess tax benefits from issuances under our stock based compensation plans partially offset by additional repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2011, a majority of our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Most of the amounts held outside of the United States could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, other than amounts representing pre 2002 undistributed Indian earnings for which we have already accrued U.S. taxes, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these amounts to fund our U.S. operations. Our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans, to make acquisitions and form joint ventures and to meet our long term capital requirements beyond a twelve month period will depend on many factors, including the rate, if any, at which our cash flow increases, our ability and willingness to accomplish acquisitions and joint ventures with capital stock, our continued intent not to repatriate foreign earnings, and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. We expect our operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the next twelve months. There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2011, 2010, and 2009 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of, or requirements for, capital resources. 61 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies As of December 31, 2011, we had outstanding fixed capital commitments of approximately $240.1 million related to our India development center expansion program, which included expenditures for land acquisition, facilities construction and furnishings to build new state of the art development and delivery centers in regions primarily designated as SEZs located in India. As of December 31, 2011, we had the following obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments due by period Total Less than1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than5 years (in thousands) Operating leases $ 510,092 $ 104,985 $ 185,294 $ 138,565 $ 81,248 Fixed capital commitments(1) 240,134 240,134 Other purchase commitments(2) 23,714 23,714 Total $ 773,940 $ 368,833 $ 185,294 $ 138,565 $ 81,248 (1) Relates to our India development and delivery center expansion program. (2) Other purchase commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. As of December 31, 2011, we had $56.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with certain tax positions on our domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized on our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. The resolution or settlement of these tax positions with the relevant taxing authorities is at various stages and therefore we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters. We are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such claims and legal actions, if decided adversely, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our quarterly or annual operating results, cash flows, or consolidated financial position. Additionally, many of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our customers business and provide benefits that are difficult to quantify. Any failure in a customers systems or our failure to meet our contractual obligations to our clients, including any breach involving a customers confidential information or sensitive data, or our obligations under applicable laws or regulations could result in a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of our responsibility for such failure. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors, mistakes, or omissions in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts will be enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors or omissions, there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and annual operating results, financial position and cash flows. Foreign Currency Risk Overall, we believe that we have limited revenue risk resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rates as approximately 78.5% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were generated from customers located in North America. However, a portion of our costs in India, representing approximately 62 Table of Contents 33.2% of our global operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2011, are denominated in the Indian rupee and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations. In addition, a portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2011 and 2010, we reported foreign currency exchange (losses) and gains, exclusive of hedging gains or losses, of approximately ($32.4) million and $11.2 million, respectively, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of Indian rupee net monetary assets on Cognizant Indias books to the U.S. dollar functional currency. On an ongoing basis, we manage a portion of this risk by limiting our net monetary asset exposure to certain currencies in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily the Indian rupee. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses. These hedges to buy Indian rupees and sell U.S. dollars are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. During 2011 and 2010, we recorded income of $18.8 million and $41.6 million, respectively, on contracts that settled during each year. As of December 31, 2011, we have outstanding contracts with a notional value of $1,193.5 million and a weighted average forward rate of 49.1 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2012, outstanding contracts with a notional value of $1,080.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 50.4 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2013, outstanding contracts with a notional value of $810.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 52.7 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2014, and outstanding contracts with a notional value of $420.0 million and a weighted average forward rate of 54.3 rupees to the U.S. dollar scheduled to mature in 2015. Our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2012 which are primarily used to hedge our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2011, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.2 million and the related fair value was an asset of $30.7 million. During 2011, inclusive of gains of $23.6 million on these undesignated balance sheet hedges, we reported net foreign currency exchange (losses) of approximately ($8.8) million. Effects of Inflation Our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits for our programming staff and other professionals. Competition in India, the United States and Europe for professionals with advanced technical skills necessary to perform our services offered has caused wages to increase at a rate greater than the general rate of inflation. As with other service providers in our industry, we must adequately anticipate wage increases, particularly on our fixed price contracts. Historically, we have experienced increases in compensation and benefit costs, including incentive based compensation, in India; however, this has not had a material impact on our results of operations as we have been able to absorb such cost increases through price increases or cost management strategies such as managing discretionary costs, mix of professional staff and utilization levels and achieving other operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset such cost increases in the future. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new guidance clarifying certain disclosure requirements related to business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. Specifically, the guidance states that, if comparative financial statements are presented, the entity should 63 Table of Contents disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. Additionally, the new standard expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required by the authoritative guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2011. Our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. However, it may result in additional disclosures in the event that we enter into a business combination that is material either on an individual or aggregate basis. In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance, which requires that comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements, thus eliminating the option of presenting the components of comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. In addition, the new guidance requires that the reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements. In December 2011, the FASB deferred the new requirements related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The requirement to present comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements has not been deferred and will be effective on a retrospective basis for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012. The adoption of this standard affects financial statement presentation only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. This standard allows, but does not require, an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The new standard gives an entity the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This new standard will be effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2012 and will not have a material effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosures related to the nature of an entitys rights to offset and any related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed and the related net exposure. The new guidance will be effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The adoption of this standard affects financial statement disclosures only and will have no effect on our financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Forward Looking Statements The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K that are not historical facts are forward looking statements (within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that involve risks and uncertainties. Such forward looking statements may be identified by, among other things, the use of forward looking terminology such as believes, expects, may, could, would, plan, intend, estimate, predict, potential, continue, should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other 64 Table of Contents variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. From time to time, we or our representatives have made or may make forward looking statements, orally or in writing. Such forward looking statements may be included in various filings made by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or press releases or oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our authorized executive officers. These forward looking statements, such as statements regarding anticipated future revenues or operating margins, contract percentage completions, earnings, capital expenditures and other statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, involve predictions. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. There are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. These factors include those set forth in Part I, in the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to appreciation or depreciation in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures. We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. Cognizant India converts U.S. dollar receipts from intercompany billings to Indian rupees to fund local expenses. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the notional value of these contracts was $3,503.5 million and $2,160.0 million, respectively. The outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2011 are scheduled to mature each month during 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the net unrealized (loss) gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts was ($385.6) million and $32.3 million, respectively. The change in the net unrealized gain (loss) position from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 was attributed to the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar in the latter part of 2011. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $291.1 million. Our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk for transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. We also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are intended to offset the foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement of these net monetary assets. We entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts scheduled to mature in 2012 which are primarily used to hedge our Indian rupee denominated net monetary assets. At December 31, 2011, the notional value of the outstanding contracts was $234.2 million and the related fair value was an asset of $30.7 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011, which estimates the fair value of the contracts based upon market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $18.6 million. 65 Table of Contents There were no off balance sheet transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons in 2011, 2010 and 2009 that would have affected our liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. We do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $2,432.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments most of which are impacted almost immediately by changes in short term interest rates. We typically invest in highly rated securities and our policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investment policy requires investments to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We may sell our investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. As of December 31, 2011, our short term investments totaled $1,121.4 million. Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of time deposits and U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds, municipal bonds, debt issuances by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies, debt issuances by foreign governments and supranational entities and asset backed securities.
