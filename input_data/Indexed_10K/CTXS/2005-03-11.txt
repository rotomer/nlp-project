ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We design, develop and market access infrastructure software, services and appliances. We market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors and our websites. We also promote our products through relationships with a wide variety of industry participants, including Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). Acquisitions Net6 On December 8, 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Net6, Inc. or Net6, a leader in providing secure access gateways. The acquisition extends our ability to provide easy and secure access to virtually any resource, both data and voice, on demand. The results of operations of Net6 are included in our results of operations beginning after December 8, 2004 as part of our Americas geographic segment. The consideration for this transaction was approximately $49.2 million paid in cash. In addition to the purchase price, there were direct transaction costs associated with the acquisition of approximately $1.7 million. The sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments. Expertcity On February 27, 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Expertcity.com, Inc. or Expertcity, a market leader in Web based desktop access as well as a leader in Web based training and customer assistance products. The results of operations of Expertcity are included in our results of operations beginning after February 27, 2004. The consideration for this transaction was approximately $241.4 million, comprised of approximately $112.6 million in cash, approximately 5.9 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $124.4 million and direct transaction costs of approximately $4.4 million. These amounts include additional common stock earned by Expertcity upon the achievement of certain revenue and other financial milestones during 2004 pursuant to the merger agreement, which will be issued during 2005. The fair value of the common stock earned as additional purchase price consideration was recorded as goodwill on the date earned. The sources of funds for consideration paid in this transaction consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock. There is no further contingent consideration related to the transaction. Purchase Accounting for Our Acquisitions Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to Expertcitys and Net6s respective net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values. Independent valuation specialists assisted us in determining the fair values of a significant portion of the net assets associated with these transactions. The allocation of the purchase price is summarized below (in thousands): Expertcity Net6 PurchasePriceAllocation Asset Life PurchasePriceAllocation Asset Life Current assets $ 26,085 $ 2,107 Property and equipment 1,998 Various 204 Various In process research and development 18,700 400 Intangible assets 50,800 3 7 years 20,300 3 7 years Goodwill 165,758 Indefinite 33,506 Indefinite Assets acquired 263,341 56,517 Current liabilities 13,617 2,836 Deferred tax liability 8,292 2,812 Total liabilities assumed 21,909 5,648 Net assets acquired, including direct transaction costs $ 241,432 $ 50,869 15 Table of Contents Net assets acquired from Expertcity consisted mainly of cash and investments, accounts receivable, deferred revenues and other current liabilities. Net liabilities acquired from Net6 consisted mainly of cash, accounts receivable, deferred revenues and other current and long term liabilities. Intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition are comprised of core and product technologies, trade names, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Intangible assets acquired in the Net6 acquisition are comprised of core and product technologies, customer relationships and covenants not to compete. The goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. The valuation of the trade names for Expertcity was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue stream that was expected from the services using the trade name. The pre tax royalty rate was applied to the product revenue and discounted to a present value. The valuation of core and product technology was based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with Expertcitys and Net6s existing products. The value of customer relationships was determined based on Expertcitys and Net6s estimated future discounted cash flows of the relationships in place after considering historical attrition rates. We expensed purchased inprocess research and development of approximately $18.7 million related to the Expertcity acquisition and $0.4 million related to the Net6 acquisition immediately upon the closing of the mergers. For more information regarding the in process research and development acquired from Expertcity, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors, and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion. Revenue Recognition. The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices, both of which are subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical collection experience and economic market conditions. We sell most of our MetaFrame Access Suite products bundled with an initial subscription for software license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may also elect to purchase technical support, product training or consulting services. We allocate revenue to software license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective 16 Table of Contents evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is allocated to the delivered software product using the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the software licenses are delivered. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on VSOE, we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined. We must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for software license updates. In the normal course of business, we do not permit product returns, but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. Price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products. We establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by product, the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent upon future events, including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments. We continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves. Our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns. If actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns, we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user. Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately $2.3 million at December 31, 2004 and $3.0 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease in allowances for estimated product returns is a reflection of the decrease in stock rotation experience primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors resulting from an increase in enterprise customer license arrangements, which are typically delivered electronically. We have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there were no reserves required for price protection at December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003. We also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives, at the time the sale is recorded. If market conditions were to decline, we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered. Core and Product Technology Assets. We review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology. We have acquired our core and product technology assets primarily from our Net6, Expertcity and Sequoia acquisitions as well as under other third party agreements. The core and product technology assets acquired in our Net6 acquisition will extend our ability to provide easy and secure access through our MetaFrame Access Suite of products. The core and product technology assets acquired in our Expertcity acquisition form the basis of our Citrix Online division and the assets acquired in our Sequoia acquisition, as well as under other third party agreements, form the basis for our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager product. The recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize these products. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased Sequoia and other technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our MetaFrame Secure Access Manager. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased Expertcity technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with our Citrix Online services. Our revenues are forecasted based on historical sales, data received from rate projections on our subscribing customer base and estimates from our sales channels and end customer sales force. Our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of MetaFrame Secure Access Manager and our Citrix Online products. Actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts. As of December 31, 2004, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value. If these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers, and there is no alternative future use for this technology, we could determine that some or all of their remaining $36.3 million carrying value is impaired. In the event of impairment, we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 17 Table of Contents On December 8, 2004, we acquired Net6, which resulted in additional core and product technology of $13.3 million, net of amortization, at December 31, 2004. For more information concerning our acquisition of Net6, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions. Goodwill. At December 31, 2004, we had $361.5 million in goodwill primarily related to our acquisitions of Net6, Expertcity and Sequoia. The goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. We operate in a single market consisting of the design, development, marketing and support of access infrastructure software, hardware and services for enterprise applications. Our revenues are derived from sales in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions and from our Citrix Online division. These three geographic regions and the Citrix Online division constitute our reportable segments. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments. We evaluate goodwill along these segments, which represent our reporting units. Substantially all of our goodwill at December 31, 2004 was associated with our Americas and Citrix Online reportable segments. On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard or SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, our goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we ceased amortizing goodwill with a net book value at January 1, 2002 of $152.4 million, including $10.1 million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets. Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. We use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill at the date of adoption and annually as required. There were no impairment charges recorded as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 or annual impairment tests. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future, which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Current and Deferred Tax Assets. We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2004, the Company has $40.8 million in net deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income, gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2004, we determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Stock based Compensation Disclosures Our stock option program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. The number and frequency of stock option grants are based on competitive practices, our operating results, the number of options available for grant under our shareholder approved plans, and other factors. All employees are eligible to participate in the stock option program. 18 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2004, we had six stock based compensation plans, including plans assumed in acquisitions. We typically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the shares at the date of grant. As discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we apply the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board or APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our plans except for 51,546 options assumed as part of the Net6 acquisition, which were accounted for in with FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25) because they had an exercise price below market value. No stock based compensation cost has been reflected in net income except for the amounts related to the 51,546 options assumed as part of the Net6 acquisition. The impact of our fixed stock plans and our stock purchase plan on our consolidated financial statements from the use of options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution. The following table (in thousands, except option price) provides information as of December 31, 2004 about the securities authorized for issuance to our employees and directors under our fixed stock compensation plans, consisting of our Amended and Restated 1995 Stock Plan, the Third Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Amended and Restated 1995 Non Employee Director Option Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 2000 Director and Officer Stock Option and Incentive Plan: (A) (B) (C) Plan Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights Weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (A)) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 36,876 $ 25.23 42,872 Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders* 52 3.86 Total 36,928 $ 25.20 42,872 * Consists of the Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Incentive Plan of Net6 Inc. and the Amended and Restated 2003 Stock Incentive Plan of Net6 Inc., each of which we assumed in our acquisition of Net6.

Net Revenues. Our operations consist of the design, development, marketing and support of access infrastructure software and services that enable effective and efficient enterprise wide deployment and management of applications and information. Net revenues include the following categories: Software Licenses, Software License Updates, Services, and Other. Software Licenses primarily represents fees related to the licensing of our MetaFrame Access Suite products. These revenues are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights. The MetaFrame Presentation Server product accounted for approximately 93.3% of our Software License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004, 97.6% of our Software License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 97.7% of our Software License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002. Software License Updates consists of fees related to our Subscription Advantage program (our terminology for post contract support) that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription. Services consist primarily of technical support services and Web based desktop access services revenue recognized ratably over the contract term, revenue from product training and certification, and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our software products, which are recognized as the services are provided. In May 1997, we entered into a five year joint license, development and marketing agreement with the Microsoft Corporation or the Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002. Other revenues in 2002 represents the royalty fees recognized in connection with the Microsoft Development Agreement. Net revenues increased $152.5 million during 2004 compared to 2003. Software License revenue decreased $4.6 million during 2004 primarily due to a weakness in our packaged product sales which are typically purchased by medium and small sized businesses. Software License Updates revenue increased $102.8 million during 2004 primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewal rates related to our Subscription Advantage program. Services revenue increased 22 Table of Contents $54.4 million during 2004 primarily due to the addition of the Citrix Online division resulting from our February 2004 Expertcity acquisition. We currently expect Subscription Advantage to continue to be of strategic importance to our business in 2005 because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream. In January 2004, we launched our Advisor Rewards Program which gives sales incentives to resellers for the sale of certain license types. In the third quarter of 2004, we extended our Advisor Rewards Program to a broader range of license types, which we anticipate will continue to stimulate demand for our MetaFrame products from smaller customers and projects. Revenues associated with our Advisor Rewards Program is partially offset by the associated incentives to our resellers. Net revenues increased $61.2 million during 2003 compared to 2002. Software License revenue increased $11.3 million during 2003 primarily due to an increase in Software Licenses, revenue from the sale of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, under enterprise customer license arrangements. Also, the increase over 2002 was partially due to weakness during 2002 in packaged product sales to our distributors and resellers, associated with a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors and overall weakness in IT spending during 2002. Software License Updates revenue increased $63.1 million during 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to the continued acceptance of our renewable Subscription Advantage program. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Other revenue of $14.1 million during 2003 associated with the expiration of the Microsoft Development Agreement in May 2002. Deferred revenues, primarily related to Citrix Subscription Advantage and Services revenues, increased approximately $60.1 million compared to December 31, 2003. The significant increase was due primarily to increased renewals of Citrix Subscription Advantage, and the services sold by our Citrix Online division, which were acquired from Expertcity. We expect deferred revenue to increase in 2005 due primarily to currently expected increases in both annual contract adoptions for Citrix Online services and Subscription Advantage renewals. International and Segment Revenues. International revenues (sales outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 53.2% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, 54.6% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, and 53.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002. An analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below: Year Ended December 31, RevenueGrowth2003 to 2004 RevenueGrowth2002 to 2003 2004 2003 2002 Americas(1) $ 335,436 $ 291,470 $ 255,438 15.1 % 14.1 % EMEA(2) 293,690 243,890 209,520 20.4 16.4 Asia Pacific 67,930 53,265 48,408 27.5 10.0 Citrix Online division 44,101 100.0 Other(3) 14,082 (100.0 ) Consolidated net revenues $ 741,157 $ 588,625 $ 527,448 25.9 11.6 (1) Our Americas segment is comprised of the United States, Canada and Latin America. (2) Defined as Europe, Middle East and Africa. (3) Represents royalty fees in connection with the Microsoft Development Agreement, which expired in May 2002. With respect to our segment revenues, the increase in net revenues during 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all geographic segments, particularly Europe. The increase in net revenues during 2003 as compared to 2002 was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all geographic segments. For additional information on international revenues, please refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the compensation costs and other personnel related costs of providing services and amortization of core and product technology, as well as costs of product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials and shipping expense service capacity costs and royalties. Cost of software licenses revenues decreased $9.7 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due primarily to a decrease in royalties due to the expiration of certain 23 Table of Contents license agreements. Cost of services revenues increased $10.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the addition of our Citrix Online division resulting from the February 2004 Expertcity acquisition. Amortization of core and product technology decreased $4.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the reclassification of certain intangible tax assets related to a 2001 acquisition from a product technology intangible asset to goodwill resulting in an approximately $7.2 million reduction in amortization expense partially offset due to an increase in amortization expense related to core and product technology intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition. Cost of revenues for software licenses revenues, cost of services revenues and amortization of core and product technology for 2003 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2002. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 96.4% for 2004, 94.7% for 2003 and 94.3% for 2002. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to the decrease in cost of revenues as discussed above. We currently anticipate that in the next twelve months, gross margin as a percentage of net revenues will remain relatively unchanged as compared with current levels. Gross margin, however, will fluctuate from time to time based on a number of factors attributable to the cost of revenues as discussed above. Operating Expenses. As further discussed below, during 2002 we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 10% (approximately 200 employees) and consolidated certain functions from our Salt Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland facilities into our Fort Lauderdale, Florida facility. As a result of such actions, we incurred expenses of approximately $10.9 million, primarily for severance and related facility expenses, of which approximately $7.0 million were included in research and development expenses, $2.8 million were included in sales, marketing and support expenses and $1.1 million were included in general and administrative expenses. Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of this policy, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year. Since the U.S. dollar was generally weak in 2004, we currently expect that operating expenses will be higher in 2005 but further dollar weakness in 2005 will not have a further material adverse impact on our operating expenses until 2006. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock based Compensation, we currently account for share based payments to employees using the APB Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards. SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. A prospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123R for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. We are currently in the process of determining the effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows that will result from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs. We expense substantially all development costs included in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products as incurred except for certain core technologies with alternative future use. Research and development expenses increased approximately $21.9 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs, as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. During 2005, we expect research and development expenses to increase as we continue to make investments in our business and hire personnel to achieve our product development goals. 24 Table of Contents Research and development expenses decreased approximately $4.5 million during 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily due to severance, relocation and reduced headcount costs and related facility charges associated with the consolidation of our Salt Lake City, Utah and Columbia, Maryland development teams into our remaining engineering facilities in Fort Lauderdale, Florida during 2002. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs for external consultants and developers. Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses. Sales, marketing and support expenses increased approximately $84.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel and related personnel costs and increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals and an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. In addition, there was an increase in marketing program costs resulting from our worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and from the marketing of services related to our Citrix Online division, which were introduced in the first quarter of 2004. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the allocation of certain revenue generating services expenses from operating expense to cost of services revenues. During 2005, we currently expect sales, marketing and support expenses to increase as we continue to make investments in our business to achieve our strategic goals. Sales, marketing and support expenses increased approximately $17.4 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals. In addition and to a lesser extent, the increase in marketing program costs resulted primarily from our launch of a worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and increases in product training costs and reseller commissions associated with the increase in our software license updates. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $20.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in external consulting and services associated with regulatory compliance requirements and information systems, an increase in headcount and related personnel costs as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $3.3 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 due primarily to a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from asset maturities and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements during 2002 and a decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation resulting from the achievement of our financial targets and an increase in insurance costs. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets. Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $5.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition. As of December 31, 2004, we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of $29.4 million. Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively unchanged in 2003 compared to 2002. Amortization expense totaled $6.2 million during 2004, $0.3 million during 2003 and $0.5 million in 2002. We currently expect amortization expense to increase during 2005 as a result of our acquisitions. For more information regarding the Net6 and Expertcity acquisitions see, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. In Process Research and Development. During 2004, we acquired Expertcity and Net6 and an aggregate of approximately $19.1 million of the respective purchase prices were allocated to in process research and development, or IPR&D. The amounts allocated to IPR&D had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and were written off at the date of the acquisitions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method. There were no write offs of IPR&D during 2003 and 2002. For more information regarding the acquisitions, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Our efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of design and development that may be required to support the release of the technologies into updated versions of existing service offerings and potentially new product and service offerings by our Citrix Online division. We currently expect that we will successfully develop new products or services utilizing the acquired in process technology, but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of future product or service offerings will be achieved. Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, changes in 25 Table of Contents technology, changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon product plans. Failure to complete the development of projects in their entirety, or in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The fair value assigned to IPR&D was based on valuations prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by independent appraisers. All fair values were determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a projects sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return, which ranged from 17% to 25%. The rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR&D. Interest Income. Interest income decreased approximately $6.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to lower levels of cash and investments held in 2004 that resulted from the maturity of AAA zero coupon corporate securities of $195.4 million in March 2004, the payment of approximately $355.7 million for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures in March 2004 and our payment of approximately $161.8 million in cash for our Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions. Interest income decreased approximately $9.8 million during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to decreases in interest rates. For more information see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Liquidity and Capital Resources and notes 3 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $13.9 million during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures on March 22, 2004. Interest expense remained relatively unchanged during 2003 compared to 2002 and primarily represented non cash interest accretion on our convertible subordinated debentures. For more information see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Write off of Deferred Debt Issuance Costs. In 2004, we incurred a charge of approximately $7.2 million for our remaining prepaid issuance costs as a result of the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures. For more information on our convertible subordinated debentures see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains (losses), other than temporary declines in the value of our equity investments and realized gains (losses) on the sale of available for sale investments. Other income (expense), net remained relatively constant during 2004 compared to 2003. The $6.9 million increase in other income (expense), net during 2003 compared to 2002 was due primarily to a decline in remeasurement and foreign currency transaction losses, as well as, realized gains on the sale of certain of our available for sale investments in 2003. Income Taxes. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA includes a deduction for 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. We may elect to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in 2005. We have started an evaluation of the repatriation provision; however, we do not expect to be able to complete this evaluation until after Congress or the Treasury Department provides guidance concerning key elements of the provision. We expect to complete our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of the anticipated guidance. Based on the provisions of the AJCA, the range of possible amounts that we are eligible to repatriate under this provision is between zero and $500 million. As such, the related potential range of income tax is between zero and $52 million. We maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates. Other than through the one time repatriation provision within the AJCA, we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, since 2000 we have not provided for deferred taxes on foreign earnings. In 2004, our effective tax rate decreased to 20% from 21% in 2003, primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a lower rate. In 2003, our effective tax rate increased to 21% from 17% in 2002 primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a higher rate. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate throughout 2005 based on a number of factors including variations in estimated taxable 26 Table of Contents income in our geographic locations, repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the AJCA, completed and potential acquisitions, and changes in statutory tax rates, among others. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2004, we generated positive operating cash flows of $265.3 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $131.5 million, adjusted for, among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of $20.9 million, non cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $33.6 million, the write off of in process research and development associated with the Net6 and Expertcity acquisitions of $19.1 million, the write off of deferred debt issuance costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of $7.2 million, provision for product returns of $6.7 million, the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs of $4.3 million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $42.5 million. Our investing activities provided $39.3 million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of our available for sale and held to maturity investments of $221.3 million partially offset by cash paid for the Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $140.8 million, the expenditure of $24.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment and cash paid for licensing agreements and core technology of $16.8 million. Our financing activities used cash of $414.1 million related to $355.7 million of cash paid for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and $121.9 million of cash paid under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $63.5 million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans. During 2003, we generated positive operating cash flows of $255.4 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $126.9 million, adjusted for, among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of $10.3 million, non cash charges, including depreciation and amortization expenses of $34.3 million, the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of $18.2 million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $60.9 million, primarily resulting in an increase in deferred revenue due to the success of our Subscription Advantage program. Our investing activities used cash of $89.3 million consisting primarily of purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of $75.3 million and the expenditure of $11.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment. Our financing activities used cash of $65.5 million related primarily to the expenditure of $124.6 million for the stock repurchase program, partially offset by the proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans of $58.4 million. Cash and Investments As of December 31, 2004, we had $417.1 million in cash and investments compared to $751.8 million at December 31, 2003. Additionally, at December 31, 2004, we had $149.1 million of restricted cash equivalents and investments, see Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments below. The $334.7 million decrease in cash and investments as compared to December 31, 2003, was due primarily to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and expenditures related to our Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions partially offset by positive cash flow from operations and stock option exercises. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs. Our short and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Convertible Subordinated Debentures and notes 3 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Included in short term investments in 2003 were $192.5 million in AAA rated zero coupon corporate securities classified as held to maturity investments that matured on March 22, 2004. At December 31, 2004, we had no investments classified as held to maturity. Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments As of December 31, 2004, we had $149.1 million in restricted cash equivalents and investments. Approximately $62.8 million in investment securities and cash equivalents were pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease and approximately $86.3 million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for certain of our credit default contracts and interest rate swaps. The $2.6 million increase in restricted cash and investments compared to December 31, 2003 is primarily due to an increase in the liability position of the interest rate swaps associated with the contracts being 27 Table of Contents collateralized. Restricted cash at December 31, 2004 is comprised of cash equivalents, short term and long term investments. We maintain the ability to manage the composition of the restricted cash equivalents and investments within certain limits to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes. For further information regarding our synthetic lease, credit default contracts and interest rate swaps, see notes 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Accounts Receivable, Net At December 31, 2004, we had approximately $108.4 million in accounts receivable, net of allowances. The increase of $20.9 million in accounts receivable as compared to 2003 was primarily due to an increase in sales, particularly in the last month of the year. Our allowance for returns is $2.3 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease of $0.7 million is comprised of $7.4 million in credits issued for stock balancing rights during 2004 partially offset by $6.7 million of provisions for returns recorded during 2004. The overall decrease in our allowance for returns is primarily due to a reduction in packaged product inventory held by our distributors. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is $2.6 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $3.4 million at December 31, 2003. The decrease of $0.7 million is comprised of $2.7 million of uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries, partially offset by $1.1 million of provisions for doubtful accounts recorded during the year and $0.9 million of provisions for doubtful accounts associated with accounts receivable acquired in our Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions. From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and medium sized businesses. If the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, no distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable. For more information regarding significant customers see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Convertible Subordinated Debentures In March 1999, we sold $850 million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures, or the Debentures, due March 22, 2019, in a private placement. The Debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $291.9 million, net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of approximately $9.6 million. In October 2000, the Board of Directors approved a program authorizing us to repurchase up to $25 million of the Debentures in open market purchases. Additionally, in April 2002, the Board of Directors granted additional authority of $100 million to us to repurchase Debentures through private transactions, bringing the total repurchase authority to $125 million. The Board of Directors authorization to repurchase the Debentures allowed us to repurchase Debentures when market conditions were favorable. As of December 31, 2003, 76,000 units of our Debentures representing $76.0 million in principal amount at maturity, had been repurchased under these programs for $29.9 million. On March 22, 2004, we redeemed all of the outstanding Debentures for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $355.7 million. We used the proceeds from our held to maturity investments that matured on March 22, 2004 and cash on hand to fund the redemption. At the date of redemption, we incurred a charge for the associated deferred debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2 million. Stock Repurchase Program As of December 31, 2004, our board of directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of $800 million. In February 2005, the Companys board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $200 million, increasing the total authority to $1 billion. The objective of our stock repurchase program is to manage actual and anticipated dilution and to improve shareholders return. At December 31, 2004, approximately $42.0 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock. We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, from time to time, we have entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower our average cost to acquire shares. These programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to a counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the period of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement. Delivery of stock under certain programs may be dependent on market conditions. Prior to June 2003, we sold 28 Table of Contents put warrants that entitled the holder of each warrant to sell to us, generally by physical delivery, one share of our common stock at a specified price. At December 31, 2004 there were no put warrants outstanding. We expended an aggregate of $121.9 million and $123.9 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively, net of premiums received, under all stock repurchase transactions. During 2004, we took delivery of a total of 4,458,740 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $18.77; and during 2003, we took delivery of a total of 8,859,381 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $15.86. Some of these shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs. Since inception of our stock repurchase programs, the average cost of shares acquired was $16.55 per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of $19.83 per share. In addition, a significant portion of the funds used to repurchase stock was funded by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. We remain committed to our ongoing stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, we have remaining prepaid notional amounts of approximately $53.1 million under our stock repurchase agreements. As the total shares to be received for the open repurchase agreements at December 31, 2004 is not determinable until the contracts mature in 2005, the above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares to be received subject to the agreements. Historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2005. We believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives. We could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Contractual Obligations We have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements (in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 4 5Years More than5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 106,243 $ 20,813 $ 29,524 $ 17,407 $ 38,499 Synthetic lease obligations 11,563 2,252 5,290 4,021 Total contractual obligations (1) $ 117,806 $ 23,065 $ 34,814 $ 21,428 $ 38,499 (1) Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellation without payment provisions exist. As of December 31, 2004, we did not have any individually material long term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, purchase obligations, or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement During 2002, we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately $61.0 million for our corporate headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us. The synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes. We do 29 Table of Contents not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Consequently, payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements. We do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources. For information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see Contractual Obligations. The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years. Upon approval by the lessor, we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods. The lease payments vary based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin. At any time during the lease term, we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice, we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. Upon at least 180 days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term, we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party. If we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately $51.9 million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor. On a periodic basis, we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment. If an evaluation were to indicate that the fair value of the property were to decline below $51.9 million, we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted balance of approximately $62.8 million as collateral, which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We maintain the ability to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes. Additionally, we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance, collateralized investments and equity investments, of $100.0 million, as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately $316.7 million in cash and investments in excess of this required level. The synthetic lease includes non financial covenants, including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised), which replaced FIN No. 46. FIN No. 46 (revised) was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor, the leased facility or the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with FIN No. 46 (revised). Accordingly, there was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds, we could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt in a future period. Commitments Capital expenditures were $24.4 million during 2004, $11.1 million during 2003 and $19.1 million during 2002. During 2004, capital expenditures were primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities and leasehold improvements. The increase of $13.3 million in capital expenditures during 2004 compared to 2003 is due to expenditures in 2004 for purchases of computer equipment related to existing and new research and development projects and leasehold improvements on renovations to currently occupied buildings. In the normal course of business, we enter into commitments related to capital expenditures, however, we currently have no material contractual commitments for capital expenditures over the next 12 months. During 2002 and 2001, we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices, including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to 2025 with a total remaining obligation at December 31, 2004 of approximately $22.5 million, of which $3.0 million was accrued for as of December 31, 2004, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our 30 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. In calculating this accrual, we made estimates, based on market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities. We periodically re evaluate our estimates; and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher. Certain Factors Which May Affect Future Results Our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and could in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors. From time to time, information provided by us or statements made by our employees contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements contained in this Form 10 K, and in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10 K, that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to statements concerning new products, product development and offerings, Subscription Advantage, product and price competition, Citrix Online division, competition and strategy, product price and inventory, contingent consideration payments, deferred revenues, economic and market conditions, revenue recognition, profits, growth of revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses, sales, marketing and support expenses, research and development expenses valuations of investments and derivative instruments, technology relationships, reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings, gross margins, amortization expense and intangible assets, interest income, interest expense, impairment charges, anticipated operating and capital expenditure requirements, cash inflows, contractual obligations in process research and development, advertising campaigns, tax rates, leasing and subleasing activities, acquisitions, stock repurchases, investment transactions, liquidity, litigation matters, intellectual property matters, distribution channels, stock price, Advisor Rewards Program, third party licenses and potential debt or equity financings constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the Section 27 of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees. Our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied and could in the future vary significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this Form 10 K, in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10 K or presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. Such factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our long sales cycle for enterprise wide sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period. In recent quarters, a growing number of our large and medium sized customers have decided to implement our enterprise customer license arrangements on a department or enterprise wide basis. Our long sales cycle for these large scale deployments makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur, and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis. We have a long sales cycle for these enterprise wide sales because: our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large scale deployment of our product to potential and existing customers prior to sale; our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services; our customers are typically large and medium size organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure; and before making a purchase, our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations, and this process can be lengthy. The continued long sales cycle for these large scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur. Delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period. 31 Table of Contents We face intense competition, which could result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins. We compete in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. For example, our ability to market the Citrix MetaFrame product line, and its individual products including: Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server, Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager, Citrix MetaFrame Conferencing Manager and Citrix MetaFrame Password Manager, and other future product offerings could be affected by Microsofts licensing and pricing scheme for client devices, servers and applications. Further, the announcement of the release, and the actual release, of new Windows based server operating systems or products incorporating similar features to our products could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future product and service offerings. In addition, alternative products for secure, remote access in the Internet software and hardware markets directly and indirectly compete with our current Citrix MetaFrame product line and our Web based desk top access products and services, including GoToAssist, GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting and anticipated future product and service offerings. Existing or new products and services that extend Internet software and hardware to provide Web based information and application access or interactive computing can materially impact our ability to sell our products and services in this market. Our current competitors in this market include Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Webex Communications, Inc., Symantec Corporation, and other makers of secure remote access solutions. As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including companies with significant market presence in the computer hardware, software and networking industries could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Sales of products within our MetaFrame product line constitute a substantial majority of our revenue. We anticipate that sales of products within our MetaFrame product line and related enhancements will constitute a substantial majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Our ability to continue to generate revenue from our MetaFrame product line will depend on market acceptance of Windows Server Operating Systems and or UNIX Operating Systems. Declines in demand for our MetaFrame products could occur as a result of: new competitive product releases and updates to existing products; price competition; technological change; decreasing or stagnant information technology spending levels; general economic conditions; or lack of success of entities with which we have a strategic or technology relationship. If our customers do not continue to purchase our MetaFrame products as a result of these or other factors, our revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 32 Table of Contents If we do not develop new products and services or enhancements to our existing products and services, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The markets for our products and services are characterized by: rapid technological change; evolving industry standards; fluctuations in customer demand; changes in customer requirements; and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. Our future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services that our customers choose to buy. If we are unable to keep pace with technological developments and customer demands by introducing new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our future success could be hindered by: delays in our introduction of new products and services; delays in market acceptance of new products and services or new releases of our current products and services; and our, or a competitors, announcement of new product or service enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing product and service offerings. For example, we cannot guarantee that our access infrastructure software will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a strategic or technology relationship, customers and prospective customers necessary to generate significant revenue. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others. If we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products and services or new releases of our current products and services, those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business could be adversely impacted by the failure to renew our agreements with Microsoft for source code access. In December 2004, we entered into a five year technology collaboration and licensing agreement with Microsoft Corporation or Microsoft. The arrangement includes a new technology initiative for closer collaboration on terminal server functionality in future server operating systems, continued access to source code for key components of Microsofts current and future server operating systems, and a patent cross licensing agreement. This technology collaboration and licensing agreement replaces the agreement we signed with Microsoft in May 2002, that provided us access to Microsoft Windows Server source code for current and future Microsoft server operating systems, including access to Windows Server 2003 and terminal services source code. There can be no assurances that our current agreements with Microsoft will be extended or renewed by Microsoft after their respective expirations. In addition, Microsoft could terminate the current agreements before the expiration of the term for breach or upon a change in our control. The early termination or the failure to renew certain terms of these agreements with Microsoft in a manner favorable to us could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements. Our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market. The demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business related computer hardware and software, which fluctuates based on numerous factors, including capital spending levels, the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions. Fluctuations in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the past, adverse economic conditions decreased demand for our products and negatively impacted our financial results. 33 Table of Contents Future economic projections for the IT sector are uncertain. If an uncertain IT spending environment persists, it could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The anticipated benefits to us of acquiring Expertcity may not be realized. We acquired Expertcity, now known as Citrix Online in February 2004, with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including, among other things, enhanced revenue and profits, greater market presence and development, and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base. We expect that the acquisition will enhance our position in the access infrastructure market through the combination of our technologies, products, services, distribution channels and customer contacts with those of Citrix Online, and will enable us to broaden our customer base to include individuals, professionals and small office/home office customers as well as extend our presence in the enterprise access infrastructure market. We may not fully realize some of these benefits and the acquisition may result in the deterioration or loss of significant business. For example, if our business or Citrix Onlines business fails to meet the demands of the marketplace, customer acceptance of the products and services of the combined companies could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Costs incurred and potential liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition also could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Achieving the expected benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the integration of Citrix Onlines and our businesses in a timely and efficient manner. The challenges involved in this integration include difficulties integrating Citrix Onlines operations, technologies and products as well as coordinating the efforts of Citrix Onlines sales organization with our larger and more widely dispersed sales organization. Although the integration of the two businesses is ongoing, it is still complex, time consuming and expensive, disruptive to our business and may result in the loss of customers or key employees or the diversion of the attention of management which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at the time of an acquisition. Our growth is dependent upon market growth, our ability to enhance existing products and services, and our ability to introduce new products and services on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services through acquisitions of other companies, product lines and or technologies. Acquisitions, including those of high technology companies, are inherently risky. We cannot assure anyone that our previous acquisitions or any future acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals either for that acquisition or for us generally. The risks we commonly encounter are: difficulties integrating the operations, technologies, and products of the acquired companies; undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third partys code in products of the acquired companies; the risk of diverting managements attention from normal daily operations of the business; potential difficulties in completing products associated with purchased in process research and development; risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions; the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company, which could unexpectedly dilute our earnings. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot guarantee that the combined company resulting from any acquisition can continue to support the growth achieved by 34 Table of Contents the companies separately. We must also focus on our ability to manage and integrate any acquisition. Our failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies could adversely affect our business and operating results. If we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets, including technology purchased in acquisitions, are impaired, we would be required to take a charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, such as product and core technology, related to our acquisition of Sequoia Software Corporation in 2001 and Expertcity and Net6 in 2004. We do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. However, we do amortize certain product and core technologies, trademarks, patents and other intangibles. We periodically evaluate our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment. As of December 31, 2004 we had $361.5 million of goodwill. We review for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future, which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2004, we had $87.2 million, net, of unamortized identified intangibles with estimable useful lives, of which $5.6 million consists of core technology we purchased in the acquisition of Sequoia, $22.1 million relates to product and core technology purchased in the Expertcity acquisition, $13.3 million relates to product and core technology purchased in the Net6 acquisition and $16.8 million represents core technology purchased under third party licenses. We have commercialized and currently market the Sequoia and other licensed technology through our secure access infrastructure software, which includes Citrix MetaFrame Secure Access Manager and Citrix MetaFrame Password Manager. We currently market the technologies acquired in the Expertcity and Net6 acquisitions through our Citrix Online and Citrix Gateway divisions. However, our channel distributors and entities with which we have technology relationships, customers or prospective customers may not purchase or widely accept our new line of products and services. If we fail to complete the development of our anticipated future product offerings, if we fail to complete them in a timely manner, or if we are unsuccessful in selling these new products and services, we could determine that the value of the purchased technology is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings. We could also incur additional charges in later periods to reflect costs associated with completing those projects that could not be completed in a timely manner. If the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired product and core technologies are less than the projections we used to initially value product and core technologies when we acquired it, such intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired. If we determine that any of our intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We recorded approximately $216.6 million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of Expertcity and $53.8 million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of Net6. If the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired intangible assets are less than the projections we used to initially value these intangible assets when we acquired them, then these intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired. If we determine that any of the goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of Expertcity or Net6 are impaired, then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a related charge to earnings. If we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets, or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future, our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected. If we fail to manage our operations and grow revenue or fail to continue to effectively control expenses, our future operating results could be adversely affected. Historically, the scope of our operations, the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations and our revenue have grown rapidly. In addition, we have acquired both domestic and international companies. This growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could continue to place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. To manage our growth, if any, effectively, we need to continue to implement and improve additional management and financial systems and controls. We may not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost effective way. Our future operating results could also depend on our ability to manage: 35 Table of Contents our expanding product line; our marketing and sales organizations; and our client support organization as installations of our products increase. In addition, to the extent our revenue grows, if at all, we believe that our cost of revenues and certain operating expenses could also increase. We believe that we could incur additional costs and royalties as we develop, license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products and services. These added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating expenses. However, we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred. In addition, we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments or issue additional shares of our common stock to fund these additional costs. We attribute most of our growth during recent years to the introduction of the MetaFrame software for Windows operating systems in mid 1998. We cannot assure you that the access infrastructure software market, in which we operate, will grow. We cannot assure you that the release of our access infrastructure software suite of products or other new products will increase our revenue growth rate. We cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter. If we experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter, we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response. Any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter. Also, due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth, our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years. We could change our licensing programs, which could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue. We continually re evaluate our licensing programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions, to market our current and future products and services. We could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances, for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period. Changes to our licensing programs, including the timing of the release of enhancements, discounts and other factors, could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. As our international sales and operations grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the United States. During 2004, we derived approximately 53% of our revenues from sales outside the United States. Our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations. To successfully expand international sales, we must establish additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international operations. These risks include: compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements; variability of foreign economic, political and labor conditions; changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by United States export laws; longer accounts receivable payment cycles; potentially adverse tax consequences; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; and 36 Table of Contents burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws. as we generate cash flow in non U.S. jurisdictions, if necessary, we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner. Our results of operations are also subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impacts on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of this practice, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher or lower in the current year depending on the weakness or strength of the dollar in the prior year. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk. Because the dollar was generally weak in 2004, operating expenses are higher in 2005, but further dollar weakness in 2005 will not have an additional material impact on our operating expenses until 2006. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and address these risks. We cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results. Our proprietary rights could offer only limited protection. Our products could infringe third party intellectual property rights, which could result in material costs. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary rights. The loss of any material trade secret, trademark, trade name, patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business. Despite our precautions, it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, we may not remain competitive. Any patents owned by us could be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope we seek, if at all, and if issued, may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. In addition, our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by: Differences in International Law; Enforceability of Licenses. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and Canada. For example, we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged products under shrink wrap or click to accept license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically, all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our products. Third Party Infringement Claims. As we expand our product lines, the number of products and competitors in our industry segments increase and the functionality of these products overlap, we could become increasingly subject to infringement claims and claims to the unauthorized use of a third partys code in our products. Companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because of developments in the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents. As a result, we could receive more patent infringement claims. Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, could result in costly litigation; injunctive relief or require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of those third parties. Licenses may not be available on reasonable terms, on terms compatible with the protection of our proprietary rights, or at all. In addition, attention to these claims could divert our managements time and attention from developing our business. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to risks associated with our strategic and technology relationships. Our business depends on strategic and technology relationships. We cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in the future. In addition to our relationship with Microsoft, we rely on strategic or technology relationships with such companies as SAP, International Business Machines Corporation, Hewlett Packard Company, Dell Inc. and others. We depend on the entities with which we have strategic or technology relationships to successfully test our products, to 37 Table of Contents incorporate our technology into their products and to market and sell those products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current strategic and technology relationships or to develop additional strategic and technology relationships. If any entities in which we have a strategic or technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology into their products or to market or sell those products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we lose access to third party licenses, releases of our products could be delayed. We believe that we will continue to rely, in part, on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products. Third party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including: undetected errors or unauthorized use of another persons code in the third partys software; disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable; and infringement actions brought by third party licensees; termination or expiration of the license. If we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third party licenses, it could delay the release of our products. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The market for our Web based training and customer assistance products is volatile, and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our Citrix Online division will be harmed. The market for our Web based training and customer assistance products is new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success with our Citrix Online division will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises, large and small, to increase their use of application services in general and for GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting and GoToAssist, in particular. Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to application services. Furthermore, some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use application services because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities, among other things, of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If enterprises do not perceive the benefits of application services, then the market for these services may not further develop at all, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our Citrix Online division. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain and further penetrate large enterprise customers. We must retain and continue to expand our ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting services. Our inability to attract and retain large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles, which could negatively impact our revenues. By granting special pricing, such as bundled pricing or discounts, to these large customers, we may have to defer recognition of some portion of the revenue from such sales. This deferral could reduce our revenues and operating profits for a given reporting period. Additionally, as we attempt to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers, we may need to increase corporate branding and marketing activities, which could increase our operating expenses. These efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits. Our success may depend on our ability to attract and retain small sized customers. In order to successfully attract new customer segments to our MetaFrame products and expand our existing relationships with enterprise customers, we must reach and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers. We have begun a marketing initiative to reach these customers that includes extending our Advisor Rewards program to include a broader range of license types. We cannot guarantee that our small sized customer marketing 38 Table of Contents initiative will be successful. Our failure to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, as we attempt to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers, we may need to increase corporate branding and broaden our marketing activities, which could increase our operating expenses. These efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and diversify our distribution channels. We currently intend to continue to expand our distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products. In addition, an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our base of channel relationships by adding more channel members with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers. This will require additional resources, as we will need to expand our internal sales and service coverage of these customers. If we fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our distribution channels, our business could be adversely affected. In addition to this diversification of our base, we will need to maintain a healthy mix of channel members who cater to smaller customers. We may need to add and remove distribution members to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our products, which could increase our operating expenses. Through our accessPARTNER network, Citrix Authorized Learning Centers and other programs, we are currently investing, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources to develop these channels, which could reduce our profits. We rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control. We rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our products. We do not control our distributors and resellers. Additionally, our distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products and could also represent other lines of products. Some of our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged products for resale to smaller end users. If distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products, our business could be adversely affected. Further, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors. The financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations. Any significant delays or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our products could contain errors that could delay the release of new products and may not be detected until after our products are shipped. Despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers, our products, especially new products or releases, could contain errors. In some cases, these errors may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been made. Errors in our products could delay the development or release of new products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products. Additionally, our products depend on third party products, which could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless. Because our products are often used in mission critical applications, errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers. Our synthetic lease is an off balance sheet arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition and results. In April 2002, we entered into a seven year synthetic lease with a lessor for our headquarters office buildings in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, so we do not include the property or the associated lease debt on our consolidated balance sheet. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised), which was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We have determined that we were not required to consolidate the lessor entity, the leased facility or the related debt upon adopting of FIN No. 46 (revised). Accordingly, there was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of our property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds, we could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt at that time. 39 Table of Contents If we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a minimum residual value of approximately $51.9 million to the lessor. Therefore, if the fair value of the property declines below $51.9 million, our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our Citrix Online division customers data, our services may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our service. Use of our GoToMyPC, GoToMeeting or GoToAssist services involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our online customers data, our reputation will be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If any compromises of security were to occur, it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the Web for commerce and communications. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations. The Internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses, software programs that disable or impair computers, have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the Internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers, which could disrupt our network or make it inaccessible to our Citrix Online division customers. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers for our Citrix Online division, which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our Citrix Online division. Evolving regulation of the Web may adversely affect our Citrix Online division. As Web commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our online customers ability to use and share data and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with these customers. In addition, taxation of services provided over the Web or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Web may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Web use or restricting information exchange over the Web could result in a decline in the use of the Web and the viability of Web based services, which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our Citrix Online division. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, we may not be able to fund our operations and fulfill our future obligations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and product development, including the payment of cash consideration in acquisitions and the payment of our other obligations, depends on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to liquidate our investments, repatriate cash and investments held in our overseas subsidiaries, sell assets or raise equity or debt financings when needed or desirable. An inability to fund our operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further information, please refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. If we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected. Our success depends, in large part, upon the services of a number of key employees. Except for certain key employees of acquired businesses, we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel. Any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The effective management of our growth, if any, could depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical, managerial, finance and marketing personnel. If any of those employees leave, we will need to attract and retain replacements for them. We also need to add key personnel in the future. 40 Table of Contents The market for these qualified employees is competitive. We could find it difficult to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in sufficient numbers. Furthermore, we may hire key personnel in connection with our future acquisitions; however, any of these employees will be able to terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. If we cannot retain and add the necessary staff and resources for these acquired businesses, our ability to develop acquired products, markets and customers could be adversely affected. Also, we may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products, product enhancements and technologies. If we cannot add the necessary staff and resources, our ability to develop future enhancements and features to our existing or future products could be delayed. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to obtain approval from our shareholders of new stock plans could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees. Several of our stock plans terminate in 2005. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has recommend to our shareholders the approval of new stock plans for the issuance of stock options and other forms of equity based compensation to our employees, officers and directors. We may not be able to secure approval for these new stock plans from our shareholders. If we do not get such approvals, we will be forced to curtail our stock option issuances, which will adversely impact our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates. If stock balancing returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves, our operating results could be adversely affected. We provide most of our distributors with stock balancing return rights, which generally permit our distributors to return products to us by the forty fifth day of a fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. We also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors. Price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a specified time period. To cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments, we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans. However, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments. If we inadequately forecast reserves, our operating results could be adversely affected. Our stock price could be volatile, and you could lose the value of your investment. Our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly to date. The trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Your investment in our stock could lose value. Some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include: actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results; analyst reports or recommendations; changes in interest rates; and other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general, The Nasdaq National Market and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic political and social conditions. General economic and market conditions, and other factors outside our control including terrorist and military actions, could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments. Any further downturn in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business. These conditions make it difficult for us, and our customers, to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an economic downturn could result in an impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments. Impairment in the value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management. As 41 Table of Contents of December 31, 2004, we had $479.9 million of short and long term investments, including restricted investments, with various issuers and financial institutions. In many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments. Fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the value of our investments, and we could lose some of our investment portfolio. A total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For further information on these investments, please refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. The analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events, gains or losses. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk, we utilize derivative financial instruments. The counter parties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2004. Actual results could differ materially. Discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Exposure to Exchange Rates A substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies, including Euros, British pounds sterling, Swiss francs, Australian dollars and Japanese yen. To reduce exposure to reduction in U.S. dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures. Our hedging program significantly reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of $39.0 million and $37.2 million, respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of $165.0 million and $160.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, these contracts had an aggregate fair value of $8.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2004 market rates the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by $13.3 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2004 market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by $13.3 million. Foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction. This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of these forward foreign exchange contracts. Exposure to Interest Rates We have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities. In order to better manage our exposure to interest rate risk, we are a party to 19 interest rate swap agreements. The swap agreements, with an aggregate notional amount of $182.4 million convert the fixed rate return on certain of our available for sale securities, to a floating rate. The aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2004 was an asset of $1.1 million. Based upon a hypothetical 1% increase in the market interest rate as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these aggregated assets would have increased by approximately $4.2 million. Based on a hypothetical 1% decrease in the market interest rate as of December 31, 2004, the fair value of these aggregated liabilities would have increased by approximately $4.2 million. The underlying assets would experience offsetting gains and losses. We also maintain available for sale and held to maturity investments in debt securities, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer, or type of instrument. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged. The securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income. If market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2004 and 2003 levels, the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. This sensitivity analysis on our available for sale portfolio excludes the underlying investments to our 19 interest rate swaps 43 Table of Contents discussed above, as the interest rate risk related to those investments has been effectively hedged. For more information see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our interest rate swap agreements and available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. In April 2002, we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately $61.0 million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters. Payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate (LIBOR plus a margin). Based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at December 31, 2004, a 100 basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition to interest rate exposure, if the fair value of our headquarters building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida were to significantly decline, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
