ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We design, develop and market technology solutions that enable on demand access to information and applications. We market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors, our websites and original equipment manufacturers. Acquisitions 2005 Acquisitions During 2005, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies, NetScaler, Inc. and Teros, Inc., or the 2005 Acquisitions, for a total of $172.6 million in cash, approximately 6.6 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $154.8 million and estimated direct transaction costs of $6.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, there were outstanding commitments for the issuance of shares of our common stock related to the purchase consideration for the 2005 Acquisitions of approximately $0.3 million, which was recorded as an accrued expense in our consolidated balance sheet. We also assumed approximately $20.6 million in unvested stock based compensation upon the closing of the transaction that was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation, or FIN, No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 2) and was recorded as deferred compensation in our consolidated balance sheet. The assumed awards had an excess of fair value over intrinsic value of approximately $0.5 million, which is reflected in the total consideration for the transactions. The 2005 Acquisitions are intended to further extend our leadership in application delivery solutions. The results of operations of the acquired companies are included as part of our results beginning after their dates of acquisition and revenues from the acquired products are included in our Product License revenue and Technical Services revenue in our consolidated statements of income. The sources of funds for consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments, borrowings on our senior revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, and shares of our authorized common stock. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our Credit Facility. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price for each of the 2005 Acquisitions was allocated to the acquired companys net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of each 2005 Acquisition. The allocation of the total purchase price is summarized below (in thousands): Purchase PriceAllocation Asset Life Current assets $ 22,931 Property and equipment 2,352 Various In process research and development 7,000 Intangible assets 76,018 3 6 years Goodwill 234,704 Indefinite Other assets 13,650 Total assets acquired 356,655 Current liabilities 21,144 Long term liabilities 1,167 Total liabilities assumed 22,311 Net assets acquired, including direct transaction costs $ 334,344 Current assets and current liabilities acquired in connection with the 2005 Acquisitions consisted mainly of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenues and other accrued expenses. Other assets consisted primarily of deferred tax assets and long term deposits. Long term liabilities assumed as part of the 2005 Acquisitions consisted primarily of the long term portion of deferred revenues and deferred tax liabilities. In connection with the purchase price allocation, we have estimated the fair value of the support, maintenance, product delivery and training obligations we assumed from the 2005 Acquisitions. The estimated fair value of these obligations was determined by utilizing a cost build up approach plus a normal profit margin. We did not include any costs associated with selling efforts, research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs as they were not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of the respective acquisitions. 26 Table of Contents Intangible assets acquired in the 2005 Acquisitions are comprised of core technologies, customer relationships, trade name and covenants not to compete. The valuation of product technology was based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the 2005 Acquisitions existing products. The value of customer relationships was determined based on the 2005 Acquisitions estimated future discounted cash flows of the relationships in place after considering historical and expected buying patterns of customers, expected cash flows from current customers, the duration of support contracts and the application of charges of other contributory assets. The valuation of the trade name for the 2005 Acquisitions was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue stream that was expected from the products using the trade name. The pre tax royalty rate was applied to the product revenue and discounted to a present value. The value of the covenants not to compete was determined by using a discounted income approach that considered the value of the agreements in place adjusted for competition, among other things. The goodwill recorded in relation to the 2005 Acquisitions was assigned to the Americas segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. 2004 Acquisitions During 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies Net6, Inc, a leader in providing secure access gateways and Expertcity.com, Inc., a leader in Web based desktop access as well as a leader in Web based meeting and customer assistance services, together, the 2004 Acquisitions. The consideration for the 2004 Acquisitions was approximately $291.0 million comprised of approximately $161.8 million in cash, $6.1 million of direct transaction costs and approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $124.8 million. The common stock valued at $124.8 million included $118.0 million related to the initial purchase price and the remaining balance is primarily related to additional common stock earned by the former stockholders of Expertcity.com, Inc. upon the achievement of certain revenue and other financial milestones during 2004 pursuant to the applicable merger agreement, which was issued in March 2005. The fair value of the common stock earned as additional purchase price consideration was recorded as goodwill on the date earned. In connection with the 2004 Acquisitions, we allocated $195.1 million to goodwill, $38.7 million to core and product technology and $32.4 million to other intangible assets. We assigned $31.7 million of the goodwill to our Americas segment and $163.4 million of the goodwill to our Online Services division. The sources of funds for consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock. There is no additional contingent consideration related to these acquisitions. In process Research and Development We expensed purchased in process research and development, or IPR&D, of approximately $7.0 million related to the 2005 Acquisitions and $19.1 million related to the 2004 Acquisitions immediately upon the closing of the acquisitions. For more information regarding the IPR&D acquired from acquisitions, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors, and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other significant accounting policies, primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below, are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements. The notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion. 27 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices, both of which are subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical collection experience and economic market conditions. If market conditions decline, or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate, we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable, and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments. We sell our Access Suite products bundled with an initial subscription for license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may also elect to purchase technical support, product training or consulting services. We allocate revenue to license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is allocated to the delivered product using the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the licenses are delivered. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on VSOE, we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined. We must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for license updates. In the normal course of business, we do not permit product returns, but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights. In accordance with the provisions of our warranties, we also provide end users of our products the right to replacement products, as applicable. Stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. Price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products. We establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by product, the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent upon future events, including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments. We continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves. Our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns. If actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns, we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user. Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately $2.3 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. We have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there were no reserves required for price protection at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. We also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives, at the time the sale is recorded. If market conditions were to decline, we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered. Core and Product Technology Assets. We review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology. We have acquired our core and product technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements. The recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology. Our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products. Actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts. As of December 31, 2005, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value. If these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors, and there is no alternative future use for the technology, we could determine that some or all of their remaining $81.7 million carrying value is impaired. In the event of impairment, we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Goodwill. At December 31, 2005, we had $592.0 million in goodwill primarily related to our 2005 Acquisitions, 2004 Acquisitions and our acquisition of Sequoia Software Corporation. The goodwill recorded in relation to these 28 Table of Contents acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. We operate in a single market consisting of the design, development, marketing and support of access infrastructure software, hardware and services. Our revenues are derived from sales in the Americas region, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, or EMEA region, and the Asia Pacific region and from our Online Services division. These three geographic regions and the Online Services division constitute our reportable segments. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments. We evaluate goodwill along these segments, which represent our reporting units. Substantially all of our goodwill at December 31, 2005 was associated with our Americas and Online Services reportable segments. Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. We use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we completed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of December 31, 2005. There were no impairment charges recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy, product portfolio or reportable segments, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future, which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Current and Deferred Tax Assets. We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2005, the Company has approximately $75.6 million in net deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income, gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2005, we determined that a valuation allowance of approximately $1.3 million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Stock based Compensation Disclosures Our stock based compensation program is a broad based, long term retention program that is intended to attract and reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee interest. The number and frequency of our stock based awards are based on competitive practices, our operating results, the number of shares available for grant under our shareholder approved plans and other factors. All employees are eligible to participate in our stock based compensation program. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, defines a fair value method of accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity instruments. Under the fair value method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is usually the vesting period. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123, companies are not required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock based transactions. Companies are permitted to account for such transactions under Accounting Principles Board, or APB, Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, but are required to disclose in a note to the consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if a company had applied the methods prescribed by SFAS No. 123. As of December 31, 2005, we had two stock based compensation plans under which we granted stock options and shares of non vested stock. In addition, we assumed stock based employee compensation plans in our 2004 and 2005 29 Table of Contents Acquisitions, but no additional awards will be granted under these assumed plans. We are currently granting stock based awards from our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Our Board of Directors has provided that no new awards will be granted under our other plans; however, awards previously granted under these plans and still outstanding will continue to be subject to all the terms and conditions of such plans, as applicable. We typically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees and non employee directors with an exercise price equal to or above the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we apply the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for our plans except for certain unvested awards assumed as part of our acquisitions, which were accounted for in accordance with FIN No. 44. Stock based compensation cost has been reflected in net income for the amounts related to the awards assumed as part of 2005 and 2004 Acquisitions, which had an exercise price below market value on the date of grant and non vested stock based awards granted as part of an overall retention program related to our 2005 Acquisitions. The impact of our fixed stock based compensation plans and our stock purchase plan on our consolidated financial statements from the use of options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards. SFAS No. 123R is effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005 (January 1, 2006 for us). As of the effective date, we will be required to expense all awards granted, modified, cancelled or repurchased as well as the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered, based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123R for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R that remain unvested on the effective date; or the modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits companies to restate either all prior periods presented or all prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures. We plan to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. We believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 123Rs fair value method will have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations. We currently estimate that our 2006 expense related to the fair value of options outstanding, as of December 31, 2005, will approximate the amount of SFAS No. 123 expense that we reported for 2005 as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The full impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our reported results of operations in 2006 will depend on the levels of share based payments granted during 2006 as well as changes in our stock price and the assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of our stock awards. Had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, we believe that the impact of the adoption of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required under SFAS No. 95. Accordingly, this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend, among other things, on when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $38.3 million in 2005, $20.9 million in 2004 and $10.3 million in 2003. In addition, upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we will also be required to reverse the deferred compensation currently recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. The reversal of the deferred compensation will be offset by a decrease in our additional paid in capital and will have no impact on our total stockholders equity. The following table provides information about stock based awards granted in 2005 and 2004 for employees, non employee directors and for certain executive officers. The stock based award data for listed officers relates to our Named Executive Officers. The Named Executive Officers for the year ended December 31, 2005, consist of our chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers who earned total annual salary and bonus in excess of $100,000 in 2005. For further information on our 2005 Named Executive Officers, see our 2006 proxy statement that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission not later than 120 days after the close of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. For 2004, the Named Executive Officers consist of our chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers who earned total annual salary and bonus in excess of $100,000 in 2004. The 2004 Named Executive Officers are identified in our 2005 Proxy Statement dated April 1, 2005.

Revenues. Our operations consist of the design, development, marketing and support of access products and services that enable on demand access to information and applications for our customers, which include individual consumers and professionals, small businesses and enterprises. Net revenues include the following categories: Product Licenses, License Updates, Online Services and Technical Services. Product Licenses primarily represents fees related to the licensing of our Access Suite products, Citrix NetScaler products and our Citrix Access Gateway products. These revenues are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights. In addition, we offer incentive programs to our channel distributors and value added resellers to stimulate demand for our products. Revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our channel distributors and value added resellers. Our Presentation Server product accounted for approximately 84.6% of our Product License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005, 93.3% of our Product License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 97.6% of our Product License revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in our Presentation Server product as a percent of our Product License revenue when comparing the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004 is due to an increase in sales of our Citrix NetScaler products, our Access Suite and our Citrix Access Gateway products. During 2006, we expect our Presentation Server product to continue to decrease as a percent of our Product License revenue due to expected increases in sales of our Citrix NetScaler products, our Access Suite and our Citrix Access Gateway products. License Updates consist of fees related to our Subscription Advantage program that are 33 Table of Contents recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription. Online Services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term. Technical Services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term, as well as, revenues from product training and certification, and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products, which is recognized as the services are provided. Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Revenues: Product licenses $ 409,435 $ 369,826 $ 374,403 $ 39,609 $ (4,577 ) License updates 331,102 271,547 168,793 59,555 102,754 Online services 99,097 44,101 54,996 44,101 Technical services 69,088 55,683 45,429 13,405 10,254 Total net revenues $ 908,722 $ 741,157 $ 588,625 $ 167,565 $ 152,532 Net revenues increased $167.6 million during 2005 compared to 2004. Product License revenue increased $39.6 million during 2005 primarily due to increased sales of our new Citrix NetScaler products acquired in our 2005 Acquisitions, increased sales of our Access Suite and increased sales of our Citrix Access Gateway products, acquired in our 2004 Acquisitions. License Updates revenue increased $59.6 million during 2005 primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewals related to our Subscription Advantage program. Online Services revenue increased $55.0 million during 2005 primarily due to continued acceptance of new and existing products of our Online Services division. Technical Services revenue increased $13.4 million during 2005 primarily due to increased sales of consulting services related to implementation of our products and, to a lesser extent, services related to our new Citrix NetScaler products. During 2006, we currently expect Product License revenue to increase due to an expected increase in revenue from sales of our Citrix NetScaler products and our Citrix Access Gateway products. We also currently expect modest revenue growth from our Access Suite products in 2006. In addition, we anticipate that Subscription Advantage will continue to be of strategic importance to our business in 2006 because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream. Online Services revenues are also currently expected to increase in 2006. Net revenues increased $152.5 million during 2004 compared to 2003. Product License revenue decreased $4.6 million during 2004 primarily due to a weakness in our packaged product sales which are typically purchased by medium and small sized businesses. License Updates revenue increased $102.8 million during 2004 primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewal rates related to our Subscription Advantage program. Online Services revenue increased $44.1 million during 2004 primarily due to the addition of the Online Services division resulting from our February 2004 Expertcity acquisition. Technical services revenue increased $10.2 million during 2004 primarily due to increased sales of consulting services related to implementation of our products. Deferred revenues are primarily comprised of License Updates revenue from our Subscription Advantage product, Online Services revenues from annual service agreements for our Online Services division and Technical Services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts. Deferred revenues increased approximately $60.9 million compared to December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased renewals of Subscription Advantage, and increased sales of our online service agreements and, to a lesser extent, sales of services related to our new Citrix NetScaler Products. We expect deferred revenue to increase in 2006 due primarily to expected increases in both annual contract adoptions for Online Services divisions products and increased Subscription Advantage renewals. International and Segment Revenues. International revenues (sales outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 50.0% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, 53.2% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, and 54.6% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease in international revenue as a percent of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 is primarily due to increased sales performance in the United States and increased sales performance and growth in our Online Services division, which is comprised primarily of domestic revenues. 34 Table of Contents An analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below: Year Ended December 31, RevenueGrowth2004 to 2005 RevenueGrowth2003 to 2004 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Americas (1) $ 397,233 $ 335,436 $ 291,470 18.4 % 15.1 % EMEA (2) 334,900 293,690 243,890 14.0 20.4 Asia Pacific 77,492 67,930 53,265 14.1 27.5 Online Services division 99,097 44,101 124.7 * Consolidated net revenues $ 908,722 $ 741,157 $ 588,625 22.6 25.9 (1) Our Americas segment is comprised of the United States, Canada and Latin America. (2) Defined as Europe, Middle East and Africa. * Not meaningful. With respect to our segment revenues, the increase in net revenues during 2005 as compared to 2004 was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments. Revenues from our Online Services division increased $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to growth resulting from continued acceptance of new and existing products in our Online Services division and, to a lesser extent, the full year impact in 2005 of our Expertcity acquisition. The increase in net revenues during 2004 as compared to 2003 was due primarily to the factors mentioned above across all geographic segments. For additional information on our acquisitions, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and for more information on our international revenues, please refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Cost of Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Cost of product license revenues $ 14,404 $ 3,824 $ 13,555 $ 10,580 $ (9,731 ) Cost of services revenues 26,794 16,472 6,481 10,322 9,991 Amortization of core and product technology 16,766 6,127 11,036 10,639 (4,909 ) Total cost of revenues $ 57,964 $ 26,423 $ 31,072 $ 31,541 $ (4,649 ) Cost of product license revenues consists primarily of hardware, product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials, shipping expense, server capacity costs and royalties. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of compensation and other personnel related costs of providing technical support, consulting, as well as our online services. Also included in cost of revenues is amortization of core and product technology. Cost of product licenses revenues increased $10.6 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due primarily to sales of our Citrix NetScaler products, and sales of our Citrix Access Gateway products both of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other software products. Cost of services revenues increased $10.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased sales in our Online Services division due to continued acceptance of our new and existing online products and, to a lesser extent, due to increased sales of consulting and technical support services related to our Access Suite products and sales of services related to our new Citrix NetScaler products. Amortization of core and product technology increased $10.6 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to amortization related to core and product technology acquired in acquisitions. The increase in amortization of core and product technology was partially offset by other core and product technology assets becoming fully amortized during the year. For more information regarding the acquisitions, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that in 2006, Cost of product license revenues will increase as compared to current levels as we currently expect sales of our Citrix NetScaler products and Citrix Access Gateway products to increase. Our Citrix NetScaler products and Citrix Access Gateway products have a higher cost of revenues than our software license products due to their hardware component. In addition, in 2006, we expect our cost of services revenues to increase due to increased sales of our online services products and an increase in technical support costs as we increase our customer base, have more frequent product releases and more complex products. Our reported total cost of revenues is also expected to increase due to increased compensation expense related to our adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 35 Table of Contents Cost of product licenses revenues decreased $9.7 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due primarily to a decrease in royalties due to the expiration of certain license agreements. Cost of services revenues increased $10.0 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the addition of our Online Services division resulting from the February 2004 Expertcity acquisition. Amortization of core and product technology decreased $4.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the reclassification of certain intangible tax assets related to a 2001 acquisition from a product technology intangible asset to goodwill resulting in an approximately $7.2 million reduction in amortization expense partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related to core and product technology intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition. Gross Margin. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 93.6% for 2005, 96.4% for 2004 and 94.7% for 2003. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to the increase in cost of revenues as discussed above. We currently expect our gross margin to decrease slightly in 2006 due to the factors discussed above under Cost of Revenues. Operating Expenses Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. As a result of this practice, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher in the current year if the dollar was weak in the prior year. If the dollar is strong in the current year, most of the benefits will be reflected in our operating costs. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk. Because the dollar was weak in 2004, operating expenses were generally higher in 2005, although there is some moderating impact due to a stronger dollar since April 2005. Research and Development Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Research and development $ 108,687 $ 86,357 $ 64,443 $ 22,330 $ 21,914 Research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs. We expensed substantially all development costs included in the research and development of our products and new functionality added to our existing products as incurred except for certain core technologies with alternative future uses. Research and development expenses increased approximately $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to an increase in staffing and related personnel costs due to the Net6 and the 2005 Acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, due to increased staffing and personnel costs related to our Access Suite of products. We currently expect research and development expenses to increase moderately in 2006 due to the full year impact of our 2005 Acquisitions, due to continued investments in our business including the hiring of personnel, and additional compensation expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Research and development expenses increased approximately $21.9 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to increased headcount and related personnel costs, as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to our Expertcity acquisition. Sales, Marketing and Support Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Sales, marketing and support $ 393,420 $ 337,566 $ 252,749 $ 55,854 $ 84,817 Sales, marketing and support expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs, including sales commissions, and the costs of marketing programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales, marketing and support expenses increased approximately $55.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily due to an increase in headcount and the associated increase in salaries, commissions and other variable compensation and employee related expenses, as well as an increase in staffing and related personnel costs due to the 2005 Acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, the full year impact of our 36 Table of Contents 2004 Acquisitions. Additionally, we increased our utilization of personnel for revenue generating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, which is reflected as cost of service revenues rather than sales, marketing and support expenses. In 2006, we currently expect sales, marketing and support expenses to increase moderately due to the full year impact of our 2005 Acquisitions, increased compensation costs as we continue to make investments in our business and hire personnel, as well as, additional compensation costs related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Sales, marketing and support expenses increased approximately $84.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003, primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel and related personnel costs and increases in commissions and other variable compensation costs due to the achievement of targeted sales goals and an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. In addition, there was an increase in marketing program costs resulting from our worldwide brand awareness and advertising campaign and from the marketing of services related to our Online Services division, which were introduced in the first quarter of 2004. These increases were partially offset by an increase in the allocation of certain revenue generating services expenses from operating expense to cost of services revenues. General and Administrative Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) General and administrative $ 125,538 $ 106,516 $ 85,672 $ 19,022 $ 20,844 General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of personnel related related costs and expenses related to outside consultants assisting with regulatory compliance and information systems, as well as, auditing and legal fees. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase in headcount, associated salaries and employee related expenses, an increase in staffing and employee related expenses due to the 2005 Acquisitions and, to a lesser extent the full year impact of our 2004 Acquisitions. We currently expect general and administrative expenses to increase in 2006 primarily due to the full year impact of our 2005 Acquisitions and due to additional compensation costs related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $20.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in external consulting and services associated with regulatory compliance requirements and information systems, an increase in headcount and related personnel costs as well as an increase in staffing and associated personnel costs related to the Expertcity acquisition. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Amortization of other intangible assets $ 11,622 $ 6,204 $ 300 $ 5,418 $ 5,904 Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $5.4 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to certain acquired finite lived intangible assets. As of December 31, 2005, we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of $55.6 million. Amortization of other intangible assets increased approximately $5.9 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the Expertcity acquisition. We currently expect amortization expense to increase during 2006 as a result of our acquisitions. For more information regarding our acquisitions see, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. In Process Research and Development Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) In process research and development $ 7,000 $ 19,100 $ $ (12,100 ) $ 19,100 37 Table of Contents In 2005, $7.0 million of the purchase price paid for our 2005 Acquisitions was allocated to IPR&D, and in 2004, $19.1 million of the purchase price paid for our 2004 Acquisitions was allocated to IPR&D. The amounts allocated to IPR&D in our acquisitions had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and were written off at the date of the acquisitions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method. For more information regarding the acquisitions, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Our efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of design and development that may be required to support the release of the technologies into updated versions of existing service offerings and potentially new product and service offerings related to our Citrix NetScaler products, Citrix Access Gateway products and our Online services. We currently expect that we will successfully develop new products or services utilizing the acquired in process technology, but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of future product or service offerings will be achieved. Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, changes in technology, changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon product plans. Failure to complete the development of projects in their entirety, or in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The fair value assigned to IPR&D was based on valuations prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by independent appraisers. All fair values were determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a projects sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return, which ranged from 17% to 25%. The rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR&D. Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest income $ 23,614 $ 14,274 $ 21,120 $ 9,340 $ (6,846 ) Interest income increased approximately $9.3 million during 2005 as compared to 2004 due to higher interest rates earned on overall higher average cash, cash equivalent and investment balances that resulted primarily from cash from operations, increased proceeds received from employee stock based compensation plans, partially offset by increased spending on stock repurchases and acquisitions. Interest income decreased approximately $6.8 million during 2004 as compared to 2003 due to lower levels of cash and investments held in 2004 that resulted from the maturity of AAA zero coupon corporate securities of $195.4 million in March 2004, the payment of approximately $355.7 million for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures in March 2004 and our payment of approximately $161.8 million in cash for our 2004 Acquisitions. For more information see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Notes 3, 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Interest expense $ 2,229 $ 4,367 $ 18,280 $ (2,138 ) $ (13,913 ) Interest expense decreased approximately $2.1 million during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures on March 22, 2004. This decrease was partially offset by interest expense incurred in 2005 related to amounts drawn during the year on our Credit Facility and our term loan facility, or the Term Loan. Interest expense decreased $13.9 million during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures on March 22, 2004. For more information see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Write off of Deferred Debt Issuance Costs Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Write off of deferred debt issuance costs $ $ 7,219 $ $ (7,219 ) $ 7,219 In 2004, we incurred a charge of approximately $7.2 million for our remaining prepaid issuance costs as a result of the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures. For more information on our convertible subordinated debentures see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Other (Expense) Income, Net Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2004Compared to2003 2005 2004 2003 (In thousands) Other (expense) income, net $ (368 ) $ 2,754 $ 3,458 $ (3,122 ) $ (704 ) Other (expense) income, net is primarily comprised of remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains (losses), other than temporary declines in the value of our equity investments and realized gains (losses) on the sale of available for sale investments. The $3.1 million decrease in other (expense) income, net during 2005 compared to 2004 was due primarily to losses on the remeasurement of our foreign currency transactions partially offset by realized gains on the sale of certain of our investments. Other (expense) income, net remained relatively constant during 2004 compared to 2003. Income Taxes On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act, or the AJCA, was signed into law. The AJCA provided for an 85% dividends received deduction on dividend distributions of foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, if certain conditions are met. During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we completed our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision of the AJCA and our Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors approved our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRP, under the AJCA. During 2005, we repatriated approximately $503.0 million of certain foreign earnings, of which $500.0 million qualified for the 85% dividends received deduction. During 2005, we recorded an estimated tax provision of approximately $24.4 million related to the repatriation. Additionally, during 2005, we recorded the reversal of approximately $8.8 million for income taxes on certain foreign earnings for which a deferred tax liability had been previously recorded. We maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates. Other than through the one time repatriation provision within the AJCA completed during 2005, we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, since 2000 we have not provided for deferred taxes on foreign earnings. In 2005, our effective tax rate increased to 26% from 20% in 2004, primarily due to the tax impact of the dividend repatriated under the AJCA. In 2004, our effective tax rate decreased to 20% from 21% in 2003, primarily due to an increase in annual taxable income in our geographic locations that are taxed at a lower rate. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate throughout 2006 based on a number of factors including variations in estimated taxable income in our geographic locations, completed and potential acquisitions, changes in statutory tax rates and the tax effects of SFAS No. 123R, among others. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2005, we generated positive operating cash flows of $293.1 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $166.3 million, adjusted for, among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of $38.3 million, non cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $50.4 million, the write off of in process research and development associated with the 2005 Acquisitions of $7.0 million, provision for product returns of $6.0 million, amortization of deferred stock based compensation of $4.3 million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $34.6 million partially offset by a deferred income tax benefit of $14.3 million. Our investing activities provided $160.3 million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of our available for sale investments of $355.0 million partially offset by cash paid for the 2005 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $168.3 million and the expenditure of $26.4 39 Table of Contents million for the purchase of property and equipment. Our financing activities used cash of $42.9 million related to $174.4 million of cash paid under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $101.6 million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and $29.9 million in net proceeds from our Credit Facility and Term Loan, net of financing fees. During 2004, we generated positive operating cash flows of $265.3 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $131.5 million, adjusted for, among other things, tax benefits from the exercise of non statutory stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options of $20.9 million, non cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $33.6 million, the write off of in process research and development associated with our 2004 Acquisitions of $19.1 million, the write off of deferred debt issuance costs on our convertible subordinated debentures of $7.2 million, provision for product returns of $6.7 million, the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of financing costs of $4.3 million and an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $42.5 million. Our investing activities provided $39.3 million of cash consisting primarily of the net proceeds, after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of our available for sale and held to maturity investments of $221.3 million partially offset by cash paid for the 2004 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $140.8 million, the expenditure of $24.4 million for the purchase of property and equipment and cash paid for licensing agreements and core technology of $16.8 million. Our financing activities used cash of $414.1 million related to $355.7 million of cash paid for the redemption of our convertible subordinated debentures and $121.9 million of cash paid under our stock repurchase programs partially offset by $63.5 million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans. Cash and Investments Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2005 2004 (In thousands) Cash and investments $ 554,221 $ 417,115 $ 137,106 As of December 31, 2005, we had $554.2 million in cash and investments compared to $417.1 million at December 31, 2004. Additionally, at December 31, 2005, we had $63.7 million of restricted cash equivalents and investments, see Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments below. The $137.1 million increase in cash and investments as compared to December 31, 2004, is primarily due to the release of restricted cash as collateral due to the termination of our credit default contracts, an increase in proceeds received from exercises of instruments under our employee stock based compensation plans and net proceeds received from our Term Loan of $29.9 million partially offset by an increase in cash paid under our stock repurchase programs and an increase in cash spent for our 2005 Acquisitions. In addition, in 2004, we redeemed our convertible subordinated debentures which reduced our average cash balances held in 2004. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs. Our short and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Convertible Subordinated Debentures and Notes 3 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2005 2004 (In thousands) Restricted cash equivalents and investments $ 63,728 $ 149,051 $ (85,323 ) As of December 31, 2005, we had $63.7 million in restricted cash equivalents and investments compared to $149.1 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in restricted cash and investments is primarily due to the termination of our credit default contracts and the release of the previously restricted collateral related to those contracts. As of December 31, 2005, restricted cash equivalents and investments are primarily comprised of approximately $62.8 million in investment securities and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease arrangement. As of December 31, 2004 restricted cash was primarily comprised of approximately $86.3 million in investment securities that were pledged as collateral for certain of our credit default contracts and interest rate swap agreements and amounts related to our synthetic lease of approximately $62.8 million. We maintain the ability to manage the composition of the restricted cash equivalents and investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes. For further information regarding our synthetic lease, credit default contracts and interest rate swaps, see Notes 10 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. 40 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable, Net Year Ended December 31, 2005Compared to2004 2005 2004 (In thousands) Accounts receivable $ 146,397 $ 113,315 $ 33,082 Allowance for returns (2,332 ) (2,273 ) (59 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts (2,050 ) (2,643 ) 593 Accounts receivable, net $ 142,015 $ 108,399 $ 33,616 At December 31, 2005, we had approximately $142.0 million in accounts receivable, net of allowances. The $33.6 million increase in accounts receivable as compared to 2004 was primarily due to an increase in sales, particularly in the last month of the year and increases related to the 2005 Acquisitions. Our allowance for returns was $2.3 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. The activity in our allowance for returns was comprised of $6.6 million in credits issued for stock balancing rights during 2005 offset by $6.6 million of provisions for returns recorded during 2005. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.1 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $2.6 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease of $0.5 million was comprised of $1.4 million of uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries, partially offset by $0.7 million of provisions for doubtful accounts associated with accounts receivable acquired in our 2005 Acquisitions and an additional $0.1 million of provisions for doubtful accounts recorded during the year. From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and medium sized businesses. If the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, no distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable. For more information regarding significant customers see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Credit Facility and Term Loan Effective on August 9, 2005, we entered into a Credit Facility, with a group of financial institutions, or the Lenders. The Credit Facility provides for a five year revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to continued covenant compliance. A portion of the revolving line of credit (i) in the aggregate amount of $25.0 million may be available for issuances of letters of credit and (ii) in the aggregate amount of $15.0 million may be available for swing line loans. The Credit Facility currently bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate or LIBOR plus 0.5% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.5% to 1.25% above LIBOR based on the level of our total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% based on the aggregate amount available under the Credit Facility and the level of our total debt and adjusted EBITDA. During the third quarter of 2005, we borrowed and repaid $75 million on the Credit Facility. The amount borrowed was used to partially fund the cash portion of the purchase price of our 2005 Acquisitions. For more information related to the 2005 Acquisitions and our long term debt, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Acquisitions and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Notes 3 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2005, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility. Effective on August 9, 2005, our subsidiary entered into the Term Loan, with the Lenders. The Term Loan provides for an eighteen month single draw term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million. The Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.5% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.5% to 1.25% above LIBOR based on the level of our total debt and adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% based on the aggregate amount of the Term Loan and the level of our subsidiarys total debt and adjusted EBITDA. We used the proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to partially fund the repatriation of certain of our foreign earnings in connection with the AJCA. For more information related to our long term debt and the AJCA, see Notes 8 and 11 of our consolidated financial statements and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations. During 2005, we repaid $69.0 million of the amount outstanding on the Term Loan. As of December 31, 2005, $31.0 million is outstanding under the Term Loan. In February 2006, we paid in full all amounts outstanding under the Term Loan. The Lenders are entitled to accelerate repayment of outstanding loans under the Credit Facility, if any, upon the occurrence of any various events of default, which include, among other events, as applicable, failure to pay when due any principal, interest or other amounts in respect of the loans, our breach of any representations and warranties (subject, in some cases, to various grace periods) or violations of any covenants under the loan documents, default under any of our other significant indebtedness, if any, a bankruptcy or insolvency event with respect to us, the rendering of a material judgment against us, material adverse developments with respect to our ERISA plans or certain changes in our control. 41 Table of Contents Under the Credit Facility, we must comply with various financial and non financial covenants. The financial covenants consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The primary non financial covenants limit our ability to pay dividends (other than pursuant to the DRP), conduct certain mergers or acquisitions, make certain investments and loans, incur future indebtedness or liens, alter our capital structure and sell stock or assets. Convertible Subordinated Debentures In March 1999, we sold $850 million principal amount at maturity of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures, or the Debentures, due March 22, 2019, in a private placement. The Debentures were priced with a yield to maturity of 5.25% and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $291.9 million, net of original issue discount and net of debt issuance costs of approximately $9.6 million. On March 22, 2004, we redeemed the outstanding Debentures for an aggregate redemption price of approximately $355.7 million. We used the proceeds from our held to maturity investments that matured on March 22, 2004 and cash on hand to fund the redemption. At the date of redemption, we incurred a charge for the associated deferred debt issuance costs of approximately $7.2 million. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of $1.0 billion, of which $200.0 million was authorized in February 2006 and $200.0 million was authorized in February 2005, the objective of which is to improve shareholders return. At December 31, 2005, approximately $67.6 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock. We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, we enter into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares. These programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counter party financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during and or at the end of the agreement or depending on market conditions, the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement. We expended an aggregate of $174.3 million during 2005 and $121.9 million during 2004, net of premiums received, under all stock repurchase transactions. During 2005, we took delivery of a total of 7,356,617 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $23.51 and during 2004, we took delivery of a total of 4,458,740 shares of outstanding common stock with an average per share price of $18.77. Some of these shares were received pursuant to prepaid programs. Since inception of our stock repurchase program, the average cost of shares acquired was $17.40 per share compared to an average close price during open trading windows of $20.58 per share. In addition, a significant portion of the funds used to repurchase stock was funded by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. We remain committed to our ongoing stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2005, we have remaining prepaid notional amounts of approximately $54.5 million under our stock repurchase agreements. As the total shares to be received for the open repurchase agreements at December 31, 2005 is not determinable until the contracts mature in 2006, the above price per share amounts exclude the remaining shares to be received subject to the agreements. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Contractual Obligations We have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (in thousands): 42 Table of Contents Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 81,545 $ 19,560 $ 23,660 $ 12,506 $ 25,819 Synthetic lease obligations 10,542 3,142 6,417 983 Term loan (1) 31,000 31,000 Interest payments on term loan (1) 1,592 1,433 159 Total contractual obligations (2) $ 124,679 $ 24,135 $ 61,236 $ 13,489 $ 25,819 (1) The Term Loan was paid in full in February 2006 and we incurred approximately $0.2 million in interest payments related to the Term Loan in 2006. (2) Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellation without payment provisions exist. As of December 31, 2005, we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations, purchase obligations, or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement During 2002, we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately $61.0 million for our corporate headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us. The synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes. We do not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Consequently, payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements. We do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources. For information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see Contractual Obligations. The initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years. Upon approval by the lessor, we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods. The lease payments vary based on LIBOR, plus a margin. At any time during the lease term, we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice, we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. Upon at least 180 days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term, we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party. If we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term, we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately $51.9 million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor. On a periodic basis, we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment. If an evaluation were to indicate that the fair value of the property were to decline below $51.9 million, we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted cash, cash equivalent or investment balance of approximately $62.8 million as collateral, which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We maintain the ability to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes. Additionally, we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance of $100.0 million, excluding our collateralized investments, equity investments and outstanding debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $422.9 million in cash and investments in excess of this required level. The synthetic lease includes non financial covenants, including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation, or FIN, No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN No. 46 (revised), which replaced FIN No. 46. FIN No. 46 (revised) was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003 and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. We determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor, the leased facility or 43 Table of Contents the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with FIN No. 46 (revised). Accordingly, there was no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows from adoption. However, if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds, we could be required to consolidate the entity, the leased facility and the debt in a future period. Commitments Capital expenditures were $26.4 million during 2005, $24.4 million during 2004 and $11.1 million during 2003. During 2005, capital expenditures were primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities, software purchases related to improving our internal infrastructure and leasehold improvements. Over the next 12 months, we currently expect capital expenditures to increase due to the planned implementation of certain systems to streamline business operations and enhance management reporting capabilities. During 2002 and 2001, we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices, including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements. Lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to 2025 with a total remaining obligation at December 31, 2005 of approximately $18.9 million, of which $1.8 million was accrued for as of December 31, 2005, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. In calculating this accrual, we made estimates, based on market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities. We periodically re evaluate our estimates; and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated, the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher. Historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2006. We believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives. We could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions. 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. The analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events, gains or losses. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency risk, we utilize derivative financial instruments. The counter parties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2005. Actual results could differ materially. Discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in Notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Exposure to Exchange Rates A substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies, including Euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars and Hong Kong dollars. To reduce exposure to reduction in U.S. dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures. Our hedging program significantly reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of $81.7 million and $39.0 million, respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of $191.5 million and $165.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of $5.1 million and at December 31, 2004 these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of $8.0 million. Based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2005 market rates, the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would increase the liability by $10.6 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2005 market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by $10.6 million, resulting in a net asset position. Foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction. This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts. Exposure to Interest Rates We have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities. We maintain available for sale investments in debt securities, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged. The securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income. If market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2005 and 2004 levels, the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. During the third quarter of 2005, we have terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements due to the sale of the underlying available for sale investments. For more information see Notes 4 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements. During 2005 our subsidiary entered into the Credit Facility and the Term Loan. Accordingly, we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. This exposure relates to our $100.0 million Credit Facility and our $100.0 million Term Loan. Borrowings under the Credit Facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 0.5% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.5% to 1.25% above LIBOR based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA. A hypothetical 1% interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we have no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we had $31.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan. 45 Table of Contents Borrowings under the Term Loan currently bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 0.5% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.5% to 1.25% above LIBOR based on our subsidiarys level of total debt and adjusted EBITDA. Pursuant to the terms of the Term Loan agreement, we have the ability to elect a rate of interest for periods of one, three or six months. As of December 31, 2005, we had set the interest rate on the Term Loan through the date of repayment. The Term Loan was paid in full in February 2006. In April 2002, we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately $61.0 million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters. Payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate (LIBOR plus a margin). Based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition to interest rate exposure, if the fair value of our headquarters building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida were to significantly decline, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
