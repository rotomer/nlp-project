ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We design, develop and market technology solutions that allow applications to be delivered, supported, and shared on demand with high performance, enhanced security, and improved total cost of ownership, or TCO. We market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers, or VARS, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors, our Websites and original equipment manufacturers. Executive Summary Our solutions can fundamentally change an information technology organizations approach and strategic value, transforming information technology, or IT, into an on demand service by centralizing the delivery of applications and desktops. Further, this approach to IT transforms data centers, making them far more flexible to adapt to the changing needs of an enterprise. We believe Citrixs approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies in the areas of application virtualization, desktop virtualization, server virtualization and application networking, to deliver the most comprehensive end to end application delivery solution marketed as Citrix Delivery Center one that, when considered as a whole, is competitively differentiated by its interoperability and feature set. 28 Table of Contents The recent crisis in the credit markets, difficulties in the financial services sector and the overall weakness in the global economy, is impacting IT spending. We are seeing IT projects delayed and in many cases re evaluated altogether. This environment could cause our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, which could reduce sales of our products and result in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. At the same time, however, this environment puts a much sharper focus on IT that can reduce cost and delivers quick, tangible return on investment, or ROI. With our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions, we intend to highlight our solutions proven abilities to significantly reduce IT costs, increase business flexibility, and deliver ROI XenApp and XenDesktop, for example, can reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop and applications in the datacenter, where they are more easily and efficiently maintained and altered. XenServer and NetScaler can alter the traditional economies of the data center by providing much greater levels of flexibility of computing resources, especially servers, by improving application performance, thus reducing the amount of processing power involved, and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers to use for multiple purposes. Further, we will endeavor to sustain the long term growth of our businesses and enhance our current solution set through technological innovation, engineering excellence, selective and strategic acquisition of technology, talent and or companies, and a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners. We expect to continue to make strategic investments in research and development of existing and new products and we will also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future application, including server and desktop delivery infrastructure products. We believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through Citrix Delivery Center is the key to meeting customer and partner needs and achieving our future growth. Further, from an operations standpoint, in order to operate more efficiently and to drive long term changes in our cost model, on January 28, 2009, we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring program, or the Strategic Restructuring Program. The Strategic Restructuring Program includes steps to reduce our headcount by approximately 500 full time positions, representing approximately 10% of our global workforce, or the Global Workforce Reduction. In addition, we are postponing merit increases that would normally occur in the second quarter of 2009 until the fourth quarter of 2009, and the 2009 merit increases for all vice presidents and company officers have been eliminated. In the first quarter of 2009, we expect to incur a pre tax charge in the range of approximately $19 million to $23 million primarily related to our Global Workforce Reduction. In addition, the Global Workforce Reduction is expected to result in an annualized pre tax savings of approximately $50.0 million. Also, as part of the Strategic Restructuring Program, we are in the process of assessing the consolidation of facilities and roles across all groups and geographies to reduce redundancy and increase standardization. In addition, we are taking further steps to reduce operating costs that include reprioritizing internal projects, reducing contract workers and limiting travel spending. Summary of Results For the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, we delivered the following financial performance: Product License revenue increased 7.5% to $620.2 million; License Updates revenue increased 15.4% to $559.3 million; Online Services revenue increased 21.7% to $260.1 million; Technical Services revenue increased 23.5% to $143.7 million; Operating income decreased 16.0% to $170.0 million; and Diluted earnings per share decreased 16.6% to $0.96. The increase in our Product License revenue was primarily driven by increased sales across all of our product groupings. We currently expect Product License sales to decrease when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to anticipated continued weakness in the global economy and its anticipated impact on our customers IT spending, as described above. The increase in License Updates revenue was driven by increased renewals of our Subscription Advantage product over a larger subscriber base and to a lesser extent an increase in Subscription Advantage associated with new product licenses. Our Online Services revenue increased due to continued sales strength of our real time collaboration services and to a lesser extent our Web based access products. We currently expect our Online Services revenue to increase slightly when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008; however, we anticipate the overall rate of growth for this group to be slower than experienced in 2008. The decrease in operating income is primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense primarily related to stock based awards assumed in conjunction with our XenSource Acquisition. 29 Table of Contents In addition, the recent financial crisis in the credit markets has caused some of our investments to experience other than temporary declines in fair value, which have resulted in impairment charges and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. We do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by holding these investments will have a material adverse effect on our operating cashflows or financial position. We continue to monitor our overall investment portfolio and if the credit ratings of the issuers of our investments deteriorate or if the issuers experience financial difficulty, including bankruptcy, we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of the securities in our investment portfolio and recognize additional impairment charges for declines in fair value which are determined to be other than temporary. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 2008 Acquisition In October 2008, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of Vapps, Inc., or Vapps, a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey. Vapps offers high quality audio conferencing solutions to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise and service provider markets that complement our online services products. The total consideration for this transaction was approximately $26.4 million in cash, including $1.0 million in transaction costs. In addition, if certain financial and operational milestones are achieved by the Vapps business, contingent consideration of up to approximately $4.4 million may be earned. The sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash and investments. In addition, we assumed approximately 0.1 million unvested stock options upon the closing of the transaction. Revenues from Vapps are included in our Online Services revenue. The Vapps results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning after the date of its acquisition and are not significant in relation to our consolidated financial statements. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price for Vapps was allocated to the acquired companys net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The allocation of the total purchase price is summarized below (in thousands): Purchase PriceAllocation AssetLife Current assets $ 744 Property and equipment 709 Various Other assets 420 In process research and development 1,140 Intangible assets 10,750 3 8 years Goodwill 19,971 Indefinite Assets 33,734 Current liabilities (3,175 ) Non current liabilities (4,201 ) Net assets $ 26,358 Current assets acquired and current liabilities assumed in connection with Vapps consisted mainly of accounts receivable and other accrued expenses. Other assets and non current liabilities consisted primarily of deferred taxes. The $20.0 million of goodwill related to Vapps was assigned to our Online Services segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for segment information. 2007 Acquisitions During 2007, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies, Ardence Delaware Inc., a leading provider of solutions that allow information technology administrators to set up and configure PCs, servers, and Web servers in real time from a centrally managed source, and XenSource, Inc., a privately held leader in enterprise grade virtual infrastructure solutions, collectively the 2007 Acquisitions. The 2007 Acquisitions positioned us in adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets that will allow us to continue to extend our leadership in the broader Application Delivery Infrastructure market. The total consideration for the 2007 Acquisitions was approximately $379.4 million, comprised of approximately 7.1 million shares of our common stock valued at $232.3 million, $142.8 million in cash and approximately $4.3 million in direct transaction costs. In addition, in connection with the 2007 Acquisitions, we issued approximately 1.3 million unvested shares of our common stock, 0.1 million non vested stock units and assumed approximately 3.4 million stock options each of which will be exercisable for the right to receive one share of our common stock upon vesting. Revenues from the products acquired in the 2007 Acquisitions are primarily included in our Product License revenue. The 2007 Acquisitions results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning after the date of each of the acquisitions. The source of funds for the cash consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments. In connection with the 2007 Acquisitions, we allocated $251.6 million to goodwill, $112.3 million to product related intangible assets and $56.3 million to other intangible assets. 30 Table of Contents 2006 Acquisitions During 2006, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies, Reflectent Software, Inc., a provider of solutions to monitor the real time performance of client server, Web and desktop applications from an end user perspective, and Orbital Data Corporation, a provider of solutions that optimize the delivery of applications over wide area networks, collectively the 2006 Acquisitions. The total consideration for the 2006 Acquisitions was $68.0 million comprised of cash paid of $65.1 million and other costs related primarily to direct transaction costs of $2.9 million, including approximately $0.3 million related to stock based awards that were granted and vested upon consummation of the acquisitions. As part of the 2006 Acquisitions, we assumed approximately 0.4 million non vested stock based awards upon the closing of the transaction. Revenues from the acquired products are primarily included in our Product License revenue and Technical Services revenue. The sources of funds for consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments. In connection with the 2006 Acquisitions, we allocated $43.7 million to goodwill, $17.3 million to product related technology and $3.6 million to other intangible assets. In process Research and Development for Acquisitions The fair values used in determining the purchase price allocation for certain intangible assets for our acquisitions were based on estimated discounted future cash flows, royalty rates and historical data, among other information. Purchased in process research and development, or IPR&D, was expensed immediately upon the closing of our 2008 acquisition of Vapps in the amount of $1.1 million, our 2007 Acquisitions in the amount of $9.8 million and our 2006 Acquisitions in the amount of $1.0 million. Such IPR&D was expensed in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, due to the fact that it pertained to technology that was not currently technologically feasible, meaning it had not reached the working model stage, did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product, was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use. The fair value assigned to in process research and development was determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a projects sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return, which ranged from 20%36%. The rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR&D. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our independent auditors, and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices, both of which are subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical collection experience and economic market conditions. If market conditions continue to decline, or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate, we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable, and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments. 31 Table of Contents We license most of our products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and unspecified upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates, when not bundled with the initial product license. Customers may also elect to purchase technical support, product training or consulting services. We allocate revenue to license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the VSOE of fair value, we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined. We must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates for subscriptions related to new products. In the normal course of business, we are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture, but we do provide most of our distributors with stock balancing and price protection rights. Stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter, subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter. Price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products. Product items returned to us under the stock balancing program must be in new, unused and unopened condition. We establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both, specific products and distributors, estimated distributor inventory levels by product, the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions. Actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are, however, dependent upon future events, including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments. We continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves. Our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns. If actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns, we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user. Allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately $1.6 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers. Accordingly, there were no reserves required for price protection at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. We also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives, at the time the sale is recorded. We could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered. Stock Based Compensation We adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 123R, Share Based Payment on January 1, 2006. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period, which is the vesting period. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected term of the award, the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends. For purposes of determining the expected volatility factor, we used the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 107. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns. We also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics. The approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from 32 Table of Contents those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock based payment awards that vest based on service, including those with graded vesting schedules, are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. Beginning in 2006, we began issuing non vested stock units and non vested stock with performance goals to certain senior members of management. The number of non vested stock units or non vested stock underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals. We are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units or non vested stock that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period. If our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change, the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met, no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. As of December 31, 2008, there was $161.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options, non vested stock and non vested stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.97 years. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and earnings per share. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. The Black Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. These characteristics are not present in our option grants. Existing valuation models, including the Black Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future. Certain stock based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. There is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values. See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for further information regarding our adoption of SFAS No. 123R. Valuation and Classification of Investments Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS No. 157. Under this standard, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Our investments are carried at fair value and in determining their fair value we are sometimes required to use various valuation techniques. SFAS No. 157 establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. SFAS No. 157 establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, described as Level 1, and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs, described as Level 3. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources, such as market quoted prices. When Level 1 observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value, we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances. When valuation techniques, other than those described as Level 1 are utilized, management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments. The degree to which managements estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments, the availability of observable inputs, the frequency of trading in the investments and the investments complexity. If we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments. After we have determined the fair value of our investments, for those that are in an unrealized loss position, we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired. We review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the 33 Table of Contents financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, rating agency actions, changes in credit default swap levels, changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors, and. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements. Product Related Technology Assets We have acquired our product related technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements. In applying purchase accounting, we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. We typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets acquired. Such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We review acquired product related technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology. The recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology. Our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products. Actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts. As of December 31, 2008, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value. If these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors, and there is no alternative future use for the technology, we could determine that some or all of their remaining $185.7 million carrying value is impaired. In the event of impairment, we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Goodwill At December 31, 2008, we had $904.5 million in goodwill related to our acquisitions. The goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. We operate in a single industry segment consisting of the design, development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand. Our revenues are derived from sales of our Citrix Delivery Center products and related technical services in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific regions and from online services sold by our Online Services division. These three geographic regions and the Online Services division constitute our reportable segments. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for additional information regarding our reportable segments. We evaluate goodwill among these segments, which represent our reporting units. Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. We use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value. Fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we completed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of December 31, 2008. There were no impairment charges recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy, product portfolio or reportable segments, it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future, which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Income Taxes We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $64.9 million in deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008, we determined that a $14.2 million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses from acquired companies and unrealized losses from temporary impairments on available for sale investments was necessary. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. 34 Table of Contents In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions, our overall financial performance, operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in Overview and Part 1 Item 1A entitled Risk Factors, which could impact our future performance and financial position. Stock Option Investigation On November 30, 2006, our Audit Committee commenced a voluntary, independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting, or the Stock Option Investigation, during the period from January 1996 through December 2006. Our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which was filed on September 7, 2007, contains a description of the Audit Committees investigation, managements related review, the conclusions of the Audit Committee and management. See also Results of Operations. Results of Operations Our operations consist of the design, development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand with high performance, enhanced security and improved total cost of ownership, or TCO. We market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers, channel distributors, system integrators, independent software vendors, our Websites and original equipment manufacturers.

Product Licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major products: Our Application Virtualization products, including XenApp; Our Application Networking products, including NetScaler, Citrix Repeater and Access Gateway; Our Desktop Virtualization product, including XenDesktop; and Our Server Virtualization product, including XenServer. In addition, we offer incentive programs to our channel distributors and VARs to stimulate demand for our products. Revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our channel distributors and VARs. License Updates consist of fees related to our Subscription Advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription. Online Services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term. Technical Services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term, as well as revenues from product training and certification, and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products, which is recognized as the services are provided. Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Revenues: Product licenses $ 620,215 $ 577,144 $ 488,487 $ 43,071 $ 88,657 License updates 559,340 484,669 405,756 74,671 78,913 Online services 260,065 213,744 148,795 46,321 64,949 Technical services 143,734 116,385 91,281 27,349 25,104 Total net revenues $ 1,583,354 $ 1,391,942 $ 1,134,319 $ 191,412 $ 257,623 Product Licenses Product License revenue increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of our Application Networking products, sales of our newer products including our Server and Desktop Virtualization products and to a lesser extent, our Application Virtualization products. Product License revenue increased during 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales of our Application Virtualization and Application Networking products and, to a lesser extent due to sales of our products acquired in 2007. We currently expect Product License sales to decrease when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to anticipated continued weakness in the global economy and its anticipated impact on the IT spending of our customers. License Updates License Updates revenue increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily due to increasing renewals related to our Subscription Advantage program over a larger base of subscribers and to a lesser extent an increase in new Subscription Advantage licenses. License update revenue increased during 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewals related to our Subscription Advantage program. We currently anticipate that License Updates revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to renewals over our installed customer base; however, these increases will be at a slower rate than experienced in 2008. Online Services Online Services revenue increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of our real time application collaboration services and, to a lesser extent our Web based access services. Online Services revenue increased during 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales of our real time application collaboration services. We currently expect our Online Services revenue to increase slightly when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008; however, we anticipate the overall rate of growth for this group to be slower than experienced in 2008. 36 Table of Contents Technical Services Technical Services revenue increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of support services related to our Application Networking products and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of support and consulting related to the implementation of our Application Virtualization products. Technical Services revenue increased during 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales of support services related to our Application Networking products and to a lesser extent an increase in sales of support and services related to the implementation of our Application Virtualization products. We currently expect Technical Services sales to decrease when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2008 consistent with the decrease in Product License revenue described above. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenues are primarily comprised of License Updates revenue from our Subscription Advantage product, Online Services revenues from annual service agreements for our online services products and Technical Services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts. Deferred revenues increased approximately $90.8 million as of December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 primarily due to increased renewals of our Subscription Advantage product, increased sales of services related to our Application Networking products and increased sales of our online service agreements. We currently expect deferred revenue to continue to increase in 2009 although at a slower rate when compared to 2008. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance. While it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of the same period. International Revenues International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately 45.8% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, 44.5% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 47.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006. For detailed information on international revenues, please refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Segment Revenues An analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below: Year Ended December 31, RevenueGrowth2007 to 2008 RevenueGrowth2006 to 2007 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Americas (1) $ 670,523 $ 614,181 $ 499,278 9.2 % 23.0 % EMEA (2) 524,465 447,201 391,650 17.3 14.2 Asia Pacific 128,301 116,816 94,596 9.8 23.5 Online Services division 260,065 213,744 148,795 21.7 43.6 Consolidated net revenues $ 1,583,354 $ 1,391,942 $ 1,134,319 13.8 22.7 (1) Our Americas segment is comprised of the United States, Canada and Latin America. (2) Defined as Europe, Middle East and Africa. With respect to our segment revenues, the increase in net revenues for the comparative periods presented was due primarily to the factors previously discussed across our reportable segments. For additional information on our segment revenues, please refer to Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cost of Net Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Cost of product license revenues $ 47,801 $ 42,984 $ 32,911 $ 4,817 $ 10,073 Cost of services revenues 79,303 65,027 46,585 14,276 18,442 Amortization of product related intangible assets 48,028 29,596 19,202 18,432 10,394 Total cost of net revenues $ 175,132 $ 137,607 $ 98,698 $ 37,525 $ 38,909 37 Table of Contents Cost of product license revenues consists primarily of hardware, product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials, shipping expense, server capacity costs and royalties. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of compensation and other personnel related costs of providing technical support and consulting, as well as the costs related to our Online Services products. Also included in cost of net revenues is amortization of product related intangible assets. Cost of product licenses revenues increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 primarily due to increased sales of our Application Networking products which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other software products. Cost of services revenues increased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to and an increase in support and consulting related to our Application Virtualization and Application Networking products and to a lesser extent increases in costs related to increased sales of our Online Services products. Amortization of product related intangible assets increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to amortization of product related intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. For more information regarding our acquisitions, see Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. We currently anticipate cost of product license revenues will decrease when comparing the first quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2008 consistent with Product License sales. Cost of product licenses revenues increased during 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to increased sales of our Application Networking products which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other software products. Cost of services revenues increased during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in sales of our Online Services products and an increase in support related to our Application Virtualization and Application Networking products. Amortization of product related intangible assets increased during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to amortization of product related intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 88.9% for 2008, 90.1% for 2007 and 91.3% for 2006. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue for all periods presented was primarily due to the increase in cost of net revenues as discussed above. We currently expect that our gross margin will remain relatively flat in the first quarter 2009 due to the factors discussed above under Cost of Net Revenues. Operating Expenses Foreign Currency Impact on Operating Expenses A substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. When the dollar is weak, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher. These higher expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts. If the dollar is strong, foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower, and our hedging practices will cause these lower expenses to be partially offset by the aggregate loss in our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk. Due to the generally stronger dollar during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to 2007, our operating expenses benefited when converted to U.S. dollars, which was partially offset by lower gains in our hedging programs. Strategic Restructuring Impact on Operating Expenses On January 28, 2009, we announced the implementation of our Strategic Restructuring Program, which includes among other things, steps to reduce our headcount by approximately 500 full time positions, representing approximately 10% of our global workforce, or the Global Workforce Reduction. In addition, we are postponing merit increases that would normally occur in the second quarter of 2009 until the fourth quarter of 2009, and the 2009 merit increases for all vice presidents and company officers have been eliminated. In the first quarter of 2009, we expect to incur a pre tax charge in the range of approximately $19 million to $23 million primarily related to our Global Workforce Reduction. In addition, the Global Workforce Reduction expected to result in an annualized pre tax savings of approximately $50.0 million. Also, as part of the Strategic Restructuring Program, we are in the process of assessing the consolidation of facilities and roles across all groups and geographies to reduce redundancy and increase standardization. In addition, we are taking further steps to reduce operating costs that include reprioritizing internal projects, reducing contract workers and limiting travel spending. Due to the Strategic Restructuring Program, we expect that in 2009, we will experience decreases in operating expenses across all operating areas including research and development, sales, marketing and support and general and administrative expenses. 38 Table of Contents Other Items Impacting Operating Expenses In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a reduction to operating expenses of approximately $6.4 million related to an adjustment of payroll taxes initially recorded in conjunction with our voluntary, independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices which were reduced upon agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS, No. 141R, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141R will require, among other things, the expensing of direct transaction costs, including deal costs and restructuring costs as incurred and acquired IPR&D assets to be capitalized. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R is effective on a prospective basis for transactions occurring in 2009. Historically, we have been acquisitive and if we continue to be so, SFAS No 141R will cause increases in our operating expenses if we enter into business combinations with material deal or restructuring costs after the standards effective date. Research and Development Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Research and development $ 288,109 $ 205,103 $ 155,331 $ 83,006 $ 49,772 Research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs. We expensed substantially all development costs included in the research and development of our products and new functionality added to our existing products as incurred, except for certain core technologies which were technologically feasible. Research and development expenses increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense primarily related to options and awards assumed in conjunction with our acquisition of XenSource, Inc., or the XenSource Acquisition. Also contributing to the increases in research and development expenses are staffing and related personnel costs due continued investment in our business and the full year impact of our XenSource Acquisition, as well as an increase in office and facility related costs associated with increased headcount. For more information regarding our acquisitions see, Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Research and development expenses increased during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in staffing and related personnel costs due to the full year impact of our 2006 Acquisitions, our 2007 Acquisitions and continued investments in our business, which included the hiring of personnel. Sales, Marketing and Services Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Sales, marketing and services $ 669,569 $ 590,409 $ 480,343 $ 79,160 $ 110,066 Sales, marketing and services expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs, including sales commissions, and the costs of marketing programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales, marketing and services expenses increased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in headcount and the associated increase in salaries and employee related expenses due to our continued investment partially offset by decreases in commissions. Also contributing to the increase sales, marketing and services expenses were increases in marketing program costs related to our worldwide advertising campaigns, an increase in stock based compensation expense primarily related to options and awards assumed in conjunction with our XenSource Acquisition and an increase in commissions paid to our resellers. During 2008, we also increased our utilization of personnel for revenue generating activities, which is reflected as cost of service revenues rather than sales, marketing and services expense. For more information regarding our acquisitions see, Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Sales, marketing and services expenses increased during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in headcount and the associated increase in salaries and employee related expenses due to our continued investment in our business and the full year impact of our 2006 Acquisitions and the impact of our 2007 Acquisitions. In addition, sales, marketing and services expenses increased during 2007 compared to 2006 due to an increase in commissions related to our growing sales force and payments made under new programs adopted to promote sales of our newer products, an increase in commissions paid to our resellers and, to a lesser 39 Table of Contents extent, an increase in marketing program costs related to our worldwide advertising campaigns. During 2007, we also increased our utilization of personnel for revenue generating activities, which is reflected as cost of service revenues rather than sales, marketing and services expenses. General and Administrative Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) General and administrative $ 256,679 $ 229,229 $ 178,669 $ 27,450 $ 50,560 General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of personnel related related costs and expenses related to outside consultants assisting with regulatory compliance and information systems, as well as accounting and legal fees. General and administrative expenses increased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in headcount and the associated salaries and employee related expenses, an increase in depreciation primarily related to information systems and an increase IT support and data services all of which were to support our growth in 2008. Also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses is an increase in stock based compensation expense primarily related to options and awards assumed in conjunction with our XenSource Acquisition. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in consulting and legal fees primarily related to the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and the associated restatements of our prior consolidated financial statements, which concluded in 2007. For more information regarding our acquisitions see, Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. General and administrative expenses increased during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in headcount and the associated salaries and employee related expenses due to our continued investment in our business and systems to support our growth, the full year impact of our 2006 Acquisitions and the impact of our 2007 Acquisitions, an increase in expenses related to outside consultants assisting us with information systems and regulatory compliance, increases in auditing, consulting and legal fees primarily related to the investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and the associated restatements of our prior consolidated financial statements and, to a lesser extent, an increase in depreciation primarily related to information systems. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Amortization of the other intangible assets $ 22,724 $ 17,387 $ 16,934 $ 5,337 $ 453 The increase in amortization of other intangible assets during 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to the full year impact of amortization related to other intangible assets acquired in our XenSource Acquisition. The increase in amortization of other intangible assets during 2007 as compared to 2006 was not significant. As of December 31, 2008, we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of $84.5 million. For more information regarding our acquisitions see, Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. In Process Research and Development Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) In process research and development $ 1,140 $ 9,800 $ 1,000 $ (8,660 ) $ 8,800 In 2008, $1.1 million of the purchase price paid for our acquisition of Vapps was allocated to IPR&D, in 2007, $9.8 million of the purchase price paid for our 2007 Acquisitions was allocated to IPR&D, and in 2006, $1.0 million of the purchase price paid for our 2006 Acquisitions was allocated to IPR&D. The amounts allocated to IPR&D in our acquisitions had not yet reached technological feasibility, had no alternative future use and were written off at the date of the acquisitions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method. For more information regarding the acquisitions, see Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. 40 Table of Contents Our efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of design and development that may be required to support the release of the technologies into updated versions of existing service offerings and potentially new product and service offerings related to the products acquired in our XenSource, Ardence, and NetScaler Acquisitions. We currently expect that we will successfully develop new products or services utilizing the acquired in process technology, but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of future product or service offerings will be achieved. Furthermore, future developments in the software industry, changes in technology, changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon product plans. Failure to complete the development of projects in their entirety, or in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The fair value assigned to IPR&D was based on valuations prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by independent appraisers. All fair values were determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a projects sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return, which ranged from 20% to 36%. The rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR&D. SFAS No. 141R will require, among other things, acquired IPR&D assets to be capitalized. If we enter into business combinations with material IPR&D after January 1, 2009, the standards effective date, we will be required to capitalize those costs, which will reduce operating expenses in the period of the acquisition and increase amortization of product related intangible assets if completion of development is reached which will be included in cost of net revenues in future periods. Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Interest income $ 31,506 $ 49,704 $ 41,210 $ (18,198 ) $ 8,494 Interest income decreased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to decreased interest rates earned on cash equivalents and investment balances. We expect interest income to decrease in 2009 due to the effect of lower interest rates as a result of current market conditions. Interest income increased during 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to overall higher average cash, cash equivalent and investment balances that resulted primarily from an increase in cash from operations and proceeds received from employee stock based compensation plans, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures. For more information see Overview and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Interest Expense Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Interest expense $ (444 ) $ (737 ) $ (927 ) $ 293 $ 190 The decrease in interest expense when comparing 2008 to 2007 and comparing 2007 to 2006 is not significant. For more information see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Other Expense, Net Year Ended December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2007Compared to2006 2008 2007 2006 (In thousands) Other expense, net $ (4,140 ) $ (466 ) $ (546 ) $ (3,674 ) $ 80 Other expense, net is primarily comprised of remeasurement and foreign currency transaction gains (losses), other than temporary declines in the value of our equity investments and debt instruments and realized gains (losses) on the sale of available for sale and trading investments. Other expense, net increased when comparing 2008 to 2007 due primarily to an increase in losses related to our foreign currency transactions and to a lesser extent, impairments of investments that we determined to have an other than temporary decline in fair value partially offset by gains recorded on an enforceable, non transferable right to sell our auction rate 41 Table of Contents securities, or the Put Option, recorded in conjunction with a legal settlement related to our investments in those auction rate securities. Upon recording the Put Option, we contemporaneously made the fair value election as allowed by SFAS No. 159, as amended, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, or SFAS No. 159. Therefore, the initial recording of the Put Option and subsequent changes in its fair value are recorded in other expense, net. Other expense, net remained relatively flat when comparing 2007 to 2006. For more information see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Income Taxes On January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation, or FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2008, our net unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $28.3 million. At December 31, 2008, there were no amounts for tax positions which would not affect the annual effective tax rate and approximately $0.2 million of accrued interest on tax positions. We are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2004. The Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in the third quarter of 2006. We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $64.9 million in deferred tax assets. SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2008, we determined that $14.2 million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses from acquired companies and unrealized losses from temporary impairments on available for sale investments was necessary. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates. We do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. We establish tax reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain of these positions may be challenged. While it is often difficult to predict whether we will prevail, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies. As such, included in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 is an additional tax reserve of approximately $2.9 million related to uncertainties arising in 2007 partially offset by a reduction of approximately $1.8 million in tax reserves related to the expiration of a statute of limitations for the 2004 tax year. In 2008, our effective tax rate increased to approximately 16.6% from (3.5%) when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2008 to the three months ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to the fourth quarter of 2007 including the reduction in tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to prior years taken in 2007. When comparing the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, our effective tax rate decreased to 9.5% from 14.5% primarily due to an increase in income in geographic locations that are taxed at lower rates and a corresponding decrease in income in geographic locations taxed at higher rates partially offset by the reduction in tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to prior years taken in 2007. The decrease in income in geographic locations taxed at higher rates is primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance, however, that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2008, we generated positive operating cash flows of $462.1 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $178.3 million, adjusted for, among other things, non cash charges including stock based compensation expense of $124.6 million and depreciation and amortization of $123.7 million. Also attributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $43.4 million, net of the effects of acquisitions. These operating cash inflows are partially offset by a $6.4 million benefit related to an adjustment of payroll taxes and $6.8 million related to a deferred income tax benefit. Our investing activities used $158.6 million of cash consisting primarily of the expenditure of $181.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment, including the purchase of our headquarters building and $68.4 million in cash paid for licensing agreements and acquisitions. These investing cash outflows are partially offset by the net sales and maturities of our available for sale investments of $90.9 million. Our financing activities used cash of $206.9 million, primarily related to $256.5 million paid for stock repurchases. This cash outflow was partially offset by $44.4 million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and $5.6 million related to excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock based awards. During 2007, we generated positive operating cash flows of $422.3 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $214.5 million, adjusted for, among other things, non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of $85.2 million, stock based compensation expense of $65.5 million and the tax effect of stock based compensation of $15.5 million. These cash inflows are partially offset by an operating cash outflow of $17.8 million related to the excess tax benefit due to the exercise of stock based awards. Also attributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $38.6 million, net of the effects of acquisitions. Our investing activities used $417.6 million consisting primarily of the net purchases after reinvestment, from sales and maturities of our available for sale investments of $180.4 million. These cash outflows also consisted of cash paid for our 2007 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $148.1 million and the expenditure of $85.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment. Our financing activities used cash of $131.8 million primarily related to $260.0 million paid under our stock repurchase programs and $8.0 million paid on our debt. These cash outflows are partially offset by $118.4 million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and $17.8 million related to excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock based awards. Historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2009. We believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives. We could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions. Cash and Investments December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2008 2007 (In thousands) Cash and investments $ 850,881 $ 798,510 $ 52,371 The increase in cash and investments at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007, is primarily due to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds received from employee stock based compensation plans, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures, licensing agreements and acquisitions, net of cash acquired. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs. Our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for further information. Available for sale investments During 2008, we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately $13.5 million related to our $50.0 million face value investment issued by AIG Matched Funding Corporation, or the AIG Capped Floater, which matures in September 2011. American International Group, Inc., or AIG, as the issuers parent, provided a guarantee of the security at the time of purchase, in September 2006. The unrealized loss was primarily caused by AIG experiencing liquidity challenges which were reportedly precipitated by problems in the capital markets. AIGs lack of liquidity triggered a downgrade in the credit ratings for its long term issues to A and A3 by two rating agencies on October 3, 2008. As a result of AIGs liquidity challenges, the Federal Reserve intervened with a five year credit facility to help stabilize AIG and the overall market. To date, AIG has not been reported to have defaulted on the terms of its loan from the Federal Reserve and continues to pay interest on the AIG Capped Floater. Because we have the ability and intent to hold this security until a recovery of fair value, which may not occur until maturity, we do not consider the security to be other than temporarily impaired. 43 Table of Contents If AIGs financial position further deteriorates, we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the AIG Capped Floater and potentially recognize an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the investment. Based on our available cash and other investments, we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by holding the AIG Capped Floater to recovery will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Gross realized gains on sales of available for sale investments during 2008 were $0.5 million and gross realized losses on available for sale investments during 2008 were $1.4 million. Gross realized gains and losses on sales of available for sale investments during 2007 were not material. The other than temporary losses on available for sale investments were primarily comprised of an impairment charge of approximately $1.1 million related to an other than temporary impairment of an investment in our portfolio due to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings. We continue to monitor our overall investment portfolio and if the credit ratings of the issuers of our investments deteriorate or if the issuers experience financial difficulty, including bankruptcy, we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of the securities in our investment portfolio and recognize additional impairment charges for declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary. Trading Investments As of December 31, 2008, we held triple A rated municipal auction rate securities, with an aggregate par value of approximately $45.5 million, whose underlying assets are generally student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program through investment accounts managed by UBS Financial Services, Inc., or UBS. The market for municipal auction rate securities in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures on February 13, 2008 and there have been no successful auctions for the securities held in our portfolio since the failures began. In November 2008, we formally accepted the terms of a settlement from UBS. Upon accepting the terms of the settlement, we received the Put Option, that would enable us to sell our auction rate securities back to UBS during the period between June 30, 2010 and July 2, 2012 at par value. Accordingly, we recorded the fair value of the Put Option in other assets in our financial statements and contemporaneously made the fair value election as allowed by SFAS No. 159. Therefore beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we began recording changes in the fair value of the Put Option in earnings. In conjunction with recording the Put Option, we also transferred our auction rate securities from available for sale to trading in the fourth quarter of 2008 and recorded a $1.1 million loss in other expense, net, upon the transfer. Accordingly, we will record changes in the fair value of our auction rate securities in earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we realized a gain of $7.4 million related to the Put Option and realized a loss of $7.5 million related to our investments in auction rate securities. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for further information. Fair Value Measurements On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We measure our cash flow hedges at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets and we generally measure our investments in available for sale securities at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. We measured our AIG Capped Floater, which is included in Level 2, using indicative pricing for another security issued by AIG with similar terms which had regular trading activity. Due to the illiquidity in the municipal auction rate securities market caused by failed auctions, quoted prices in active markets are not currently available for our investments in municipal auction rate securities. We measured these securities at fair value using a discounted cash flow model. In our discounted cash flow model, we used several assumptions to derive a fair value for our investments in municipal auction rate securities including a discount rate based on the credit quality of the underlying investments and a factor to further discount the investments for the illiquidity currently present in the market for these securities. Accordingly, these securities changed from Level 1 to Level 3 within SFAS No. 157s three tier fair value hierarchy since valuation at December 31, 2007. Also included in Level 3 is the Put Option. In order to determine the fair value of the Put Option, we 44 Table of Contents measured the differential between the aggregate par value of our auction rate securities and their fair value as of the reporting date and applied a discount rate that considers both the time period between the reporting date and the first date we are able to exercise our right to put the auction rate securities to UBS per the terms of the settlement and the credit worthiness of UBS.

Restricted Cash Equivalents and Investments December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2008 2007 (In thousands) Restricted cash equivalents and investments $ 883 $ 63,735 $ (62,852 ) Restricted cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2007 are primarily comprised of approximately $62.8 million in investment securities and cash equivalents pledged as collateral for specified obligations under our synthetic lease arrangement. We were a party to a synthetic lease arrangement for our corporate headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The initial term of the synthetic lease was seven years, expiring in April 2009. At any time during the lease term and upon a 30 days written notice, we had the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. In October 2008, we terminated the synthetic lease, purchased the underlying property and ceased to be bound by the lease covenants. The majority of the amounts related to our synthetic lease collateral arrangement and classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2007, were used to purchase the property and are no longer restricted. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for further information. Accounts Receivable, Net December 31, 2008Compared to2007 2008 2007 (In thousands) Accounts receivable $ 239,998 $ 230,422 $ 9,576 Allowance for returns (1,641 ) (1,670 ) 29 Allowance for doubtful accounts (7,061 ) (2,891 ) (4,170 ) Accounts receivable, net $ 231,296 $ 225,861 $ 5,435 The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 was primarily due to an increase in sales, particularly in the last month of 2008 compared to the last month of 2007. Our allowance for returns remained relatively constant during 2008 as compared to 2007. The activity in our allowance for returns was comprised of $2.1 million in credits issued for stock balancing rights during 2008 offset by $2.1 million of provisions for returns recorded during 2008. Our allowance for doubtful accounts increased by $4.2 million when comparing 2008 to 2007. The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts was comprised primarily of an additional $3.4 million acquired in conjunction with our acquisition of Vapps, $1.6 million of provisions for doubtful accounts recorded during the year partially offset by $0.8 million of uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries. From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and medium sized businesses. If the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, no distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable. For more information regarding significant customers see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. 45 Table of Contents Credit Facility and Term Loan Effective on August 9, 2005, we entered into the Credit Facility with a group of financial institutions, or the Lenders. Effective September 27, 2006, we entered into an amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility, or the Amendment. The Amendment decreased the overall range of interest we will pay on amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility and lowered the facility fee. In addition, the Amendment extended the term of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, as amended, allows us to increase the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of $175.0 million. The Credit Facility, as amended, currently provides for a revolving line of credit that will expire on September 27, 2011 in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to continued covenant compliance. A portion of the revolving line of credit (1) in the aggregate amount of $25.0 million may be available for issuances of letters of credit and (2) in the aggregate amount of $15.0 million may be available for swing line loans. The Credit Facility, as amended, currently bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 0.32% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.32% to 0.80% above LIBOR based on the level of our total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. In addition, we are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% based on the aggregate amount available under the Credit Facility, as amended, and the level of our total debt and adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no funds were borrowed under the Credit Facility, as amended, and as of December 31, 2008 there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, as amended. The Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary default provisions, and we must comply with various financial and non financial covenants. The financial covenants consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The primary non financial covenants contain certain limits on our ability to pay dividends, conduct certain mergers or acquisitions, make certain investments and loans, incur future indebtedness or liens, alter our capital structure or sell stock or assets. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility. Effective on August 9, 2005, we entered into the Term Loan with the Lenders. The Term Loan provided for an eighteen month single draw term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million. The Term Loans interest rate was LIBOR plus 0.5% and adjusted in the range of 0.5% to 1.25% above LIBOR based on the level of our total debt and adjusted EBITDA. In addition, we were required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.25% based on the aggregate amount of the Term Loan and the level of our total debt and adjusted EBITDA. We used the proceeds from the Term Loan to partially fund the repatriation of certain of our foreign earnings in connection with the American Jobs Creation Act. In February 2006, we repaid the remaining $31.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan in full. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of $1.8 billion. We may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted. The objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders returns. At December 31, 2008, approximately $77.0 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock. A portion of the funds used to repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, we entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares. These programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we took delivery of 4,406,757 shares at an average price of $33.30 per share from our structured repurchase agreements and we expended approximately $197.6 million on open market purchases repurchasing 6,451,591 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $30.63. In addition, during the period we made up front payments of $58.9 million to certain financial institutions related to structured stock repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2008, we had no prepaid notional amounts remaining under our structured stock repurchase programs. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we took delivery of 1,655,089 shares at an average price of $35.34 per share from our structured repurchase agreements and we expended approximately $150.0 million on open market purchases repurchasing 3,720,800 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $40.31. In addition, during the period we made up front payments of $110.0 million to certain financial institutions related to structured stock repurchase agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we took delivery of 4,307,112 shares at an average price of $30.76 per share from our structured repurchase agreements and we expended approximately $159.8 million on open market purchases repurchasing 5,193,410 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $30.77. In addition, during the period we made up front payments of $114.4 million to certain financial institutions related to structured stock repurchase agreements. 46 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Contractual Obligations We have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 223,802 $ 45,668 $ 74,595 $ 50,839 $ 52,700 Purchase obligations (2) 6,311 6,311 Total contractual obligations (3) $ 230,113 $ 51,979 $ 74,595 $ 50,839 $ 52,700 (1) In 2008, we entered into a lease to acquire additional office space in Santa Clara, CA. The rental commencement date will not begin until 2011and the pricing for the lease will not be finalized until a future date. Accordingly, the future payment obligations related to this lease are not included in the table above. (2) Purchase obligations represent non cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year end. (3) Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes $28.3 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with FIN No. 48, because we could not make reasonably reliable estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008 for further information. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement During 2002, we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately $61.0 million for our corporate headquarters office space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The synthetic lease represented a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded 100% of the costs of acquiring the property and leased the asset to us. The synthetic lease qualified as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes. We did not include the property or the related lease debt as an asset or a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. Consequently, payments made pursuant to the lease were recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income. We entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements. The initial term of the synthetic lease was seven years, expiring in April 2009. The lease payments varied based on LIBOR plus a margin. At any time during the lease term and upon 30 days written notice, we had the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately $61.0 million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed. Effective October 23, 2008, we exercised our option and purchased the property for approximately $61.1 million, including closing costs and legal fees. There were no lease breakage costs incurred. The synthetic lease included certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a pledged balance of approximately $62.8 million in cash and or investment securities as collateral. This amount was included in restricted cash equivalents and investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. The synthetic lease also included non financial covenants, including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance, prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property. Following the termination of the synthetic lease, we ceased to be bound by these covenants. Commitments Capital expenditures were $181.0 million during 2008, $85.9 million during 2007 and $52.1 million during 2006. During 2008, capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities, the purchase of our corporate headquarters buildings and leasehold improvements. During 2007, capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities and leasehold improvements. We currently anticipate that capital expenditures will decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 levels. 47 Table of Contents We have an operating lease obligation related to a property that is not fully utilized that continues to 2018 with a total remaining obligation at December 31, 2008 of approximately $5.0 million, of which $0.9 million was accrued as of December 31, 2008, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in consolidated financial statements. In calculating this accrual, we made estimates, based on market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities. We periodically re evaluate our estimates and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than we estimated, the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher. We currently expect that our liabilities related to operating lease obligations for properties that are not fully utilized will increase due to our Strategic Restructuring Program. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. The analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events, gains or losses. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency risk, we utilize derivative financial instruments. The counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2008. Actual results could differ materially. Discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in Notes 2 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Exposure to Exchange Rates A substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies, including Euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, Indian rupees, Swiss francs, Singapore dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Canadian dollars, Danish krone and Swedish krona. To reduce our exposure to a reduction in U.S. dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures. Our hedging program significantly reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of $124.2 million and $104.3 million, respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of $339.6 million and $311.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008, these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of $4.3 million and at December 31, 2007, these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of $5.8 million. Based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2008 market rates, the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by $21.3 million. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2008 market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by $21.3 million, resulting in a net asset position. In these hypothetical movements, foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction. This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts. Exposure to Interest Rates We have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale and trading securities. We maintain available for sale and trading investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged. The securities classified as available for sale and trading are subject to interest rate risk. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income. If market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2008 and 2007 levels, the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately $3.2 million in each period. If market interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points from December 31, 2008 and 2007 levels, the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately $3.2 million in each period. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. 48 Table of Contents During 2005, we entered into the Credit Facility, as amended in 2006, or the Amended Credit Facility. Accordingly, we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. This exposure relates to our $100.0 million Amended Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 0.32% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.32% to 0.80% above LIBOR based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. A hypothetical 1% interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we had no amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2008.
