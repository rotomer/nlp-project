ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We design, develop and market technology solutions that enable information technology, or IT, services to be securely delivered on demand independent of location, device or network. Our customers achieve lower IT operating costs, increased information security, and greater business agility using Citrix technologies that enable virtual computing. We market and license our products directly to enterprise customers, over the web, and through systems integrators, or SIs, in addition to indirectly through value added resellers, or VARs, value added distributors, or VADs, and original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. Executive Summary Our solutions can fundamentally change an information technology organizations approach and strategic value, transforming IT into an on demand service by centralizing the delivery of applications and desktops. Further, this approach to IT transforms data centers, making them far more flexible to adapt to the changing needs of an enterprise. We believe our approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies in the area of desktop management, including but not limited to desktop virtualization and application virtualization, marketed as our Desktop Solutions, and server virtualization, application networking and optimization, marketed as our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions, to deliver a comprehensive end to end application delivery solution, and one that, when considered as a whole, is competitively differentiated by its feature set and interoperability. The global recession that started in 2008 impacted IT spending, and we saw uncertainties surrounding IT spending, particularly in the European markets in 2010. We expect this trend to continue as we enter 2011. The overall economic uncertainty may adversely affect sales of our products and services and may result in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of technologies and increased price competition, particularly in European markets. In todays business environment, however, there is a sharp focus on IT products and services that can reduce cost and deliver a quick, tangible return on investment, or ROI. With our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions, we intend to continue highlighting our solutions abilities to reduce IT costs, increase business flexibility and deliver ROI. Our Desktop Solutions are built to transform and reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop, with our XenDesktop product, and virtualizing applications, with our XenApp product, in a customers datacenter, where they are more easily and efficiently maintained. We plan to continue the initiatives that we began in the fourth quarter of 2009 and executed on throughout 2010 to accelerate our XenApp install bases adoption of our broader Desktop Solutions product portfolio through our XenDesktop trade up program. Our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions, which include XenServer and NetScaler, can alter the traditional economies of the datacenter by providing much greater levels of flexibility of computing resources, especially with respect to servers, by improving application performance and thereby reducing the amount of processing power involved, and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers for multiple purposes. Our Online Services division is focused on developing and marketing Web based access, support and collaboration services. These services are primarily marketed via the Web to large enterprises, medium and small businesses, prosumers and individuals. Our Online Services divisions web collaboration services offer secure and cost effective solutions that allow users to host and actively participate in online meetings, webinars and training sessions remotely and reduce costs associated with business travel. Our remote access solution offers a secure, simple and cost efficient way for users to access their desktops remotely, and our remote support solutions offer secure, on demand support over the Internet. In addition, we expect to continue to grow our Online Services division by increasing our addressable market geographically and offering services that appeal to a wider range of customers. To accelerate the European expansion of our Online Services division, in February 2011, we acquired Netviewer AG, or Netviewer, a privately held European SaaS vendor in collaboration and IT services. Netviewer will become part of our Online Services division and enable the extension of our SaaS leadership in Europe. Our priorities for 2011 are to sustain the long term growth of our businesses and enhance our current solutions through technological innovation, engineering excellence, selective and strategic acquisition of technology, talent and or companies, and through a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners. We expect to continue our 2010 initiatives and make strategic investments in research and development of existing and new products, and to invest in research and development of advanced and innovative technologies for future application, including increasing research and development capacity and headcount. We believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our Enterprise divisions products and our Online Services divisions services is the key to meeting customer and partner needs and 29 Table of Contents achieving our future growth.We also intend to continue making significant investments to expand our brand awareness in virtualization, networking and cloud computing spaces. We also plan to increase sales, consulting and technical services capacity and headcount to drive larger strategic customer engagements and more focus on SI partnerships as well as investing in new channel programs that allow our partners to upgrade their capabilities in desktop virtualization, which we currently believe is our largest area of opportunity. On January 28, 2009, we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring program, or the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program. The 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program included reducing our headcount by approximately 450 full time positions. In the year ended December 31, 2009, we incurred a pre tax charge of $26.5 million related to employee severance and related costs and costs related to the consolidation of certain of our facilities. Summary of Results For the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009, we delivered the following financial performance: Product License revenue increased 14.9% to $619.5 million; License Updates revenue increased 12.8% to $682.2 million; Online Services revenue increased 17.0% to $360.6 million; Technical Services revenue increased 31.1% to $212.3 million; Operating income increased 79.5% to $320.7 million; Diluted earnings per share increased 41.0% to $1.46; Cash flow from operations increased 27.3% to $616.3 million; Cash and investment balances increased 39.6% to $1,685.7 million; and Deferred revenues increased 25.9% to $779.0 million. The increase in our Product License revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions, led by our Application Networking products and increased sales of our Desktop Solutions, led by our XenDesktop product and XenDesktop trade up program. We currently expect our Product License revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010. The increase in License Updates revenue was driven by sales of new licenses with Subscription Advantage. Our Online Services revenue increased due to increased sales of our web collaboration services. The increase in Technical Services revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of support and consulting services related to our Enterprise divisions products. Our increase in operating income and diluted earnings per share was driven by our increased revenue as well as operating leverage gained by managing our overall operating expenses. In addition, 2009 operating margin also included $26.5 million of additional operating expenses related to our 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program. We currently expect that total revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010, as well as when comparing the 2011 fiscal year to the 2010 fiscal year. During 2010, we generated positive operating cash flows of $616.3 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $276.4 million, adjusted for, among other things, non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of $138.2 million, stock based compensation expense of $103.8 million and the tax effect of stock based compensation of $51.5 million. Also contributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $144.8 million, net of the effects of acquisitions. These operating cash inflows are partially offset by the excess benefit from the exercise of stock options of $60.2 million and $46.7 million related to a deferred income tax benefit. The increase in cash and investments at December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, was primarily due to cash provided by our operating activities of $616.3 million and cash received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of $353.6 million, partially offset by expenditures made on our stock repurchases of $433.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $75.4 million. The increase in deferred revenues at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 was primarily due to increased sales and renewals of our Subscription Advantage product of $102.0 million and increased sales of our support services of $50.3 million. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our net revenues have fluctuated quarterly and have generally been the highest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends. This seasonal factor also typically results in net revenue during the fourth quarter of any year being typically higher than the revenue for the first quarter of the subsequent year. 30 Table of Contents 2010 Acquisitions On September 7, 2010, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of VMLogix Inc., or VMLogix, a privately held corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, California. VMLogix is a provider of virtualization management software for private and public cloud computing systems. The total consideration for this transaction was approximately $13.2 million, comprised of approximately $10.4 million in cash and approximately $2.8 million related to VMLogix liabilities settled in conjunction with the acquisition. The sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash. We recorded approximately $7.7 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, and acquired $10.6 million in assets including $7.5 million of identifiable intangible assets, of which $6.2 million is related to product related intangible assets with a useful life of 5.0 years and $1.3 million is related to other intangible assets with a useful life of 4.0 years. We assumed liabilities of approximately $5.1 million in conjunction with the acquisition. In addition, we also assumed stock options for which the vesting period reset fully upon the closing of the transaction. When these stock options vest, they will be exercisable for up to 47,784 shares of our common stock. We have included the effect of this transaction in our results of operations prospectively from the date of the acquisition, which effect was not material to our consolidated results. During the first quarter of 2010, we acquired two privately held companies for a total cash consideration of approximately $9.2 million. We recorded approximately $2.6 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes, and acquired $9.4 million in assets including $7.1 million of identifiable intangible assets, of which $6.2 million is related to product related intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of 5.0 years and $0.9 million is related to other intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of 2.0 years. In addition, we assumed liabilities of approximately $2.8 million in conjunction with the acquisitions. We have included the effects of these transactions in our results of operations prospectively from the respective dates of the acquisitions, which were not material to our consolidated results. 2008 Acquisition In October 2008, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of Vapps, Inc., or Vapps, a privately held corporation headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey. Vapps offers high quality audio conferencing solutions to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise and service provider markets that complement our online services. The total consideration for this transaction was approximately $29.7 million in cash, including $1.0 million in transaction costs. At the time of the acquisition, if certain financial and operational milestones are achieved by the Vapps business, contingent consideration of up to approximately $4.4 million may be earned. As of December 31, 2010, $1.9 million and $1.2 million was earned in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash and investments. In addition, we assumed unvested stock options upon the closing of the transaction, which will become exercisable (upon vesting) for approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock. In connection with the Vapps Acquisition, we allocated $21.8 million to goodwill, $8.2 million to product related technologies and $2.6 million to other intangible assets. The goodwill related to the Vapps acquisition was allocated to our Online Services division and is not deductible for tax purposes. Netviewer AG Acquisition In December 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of Netviewer AG, or Netviewer, a privately held European SaaS vendor in collaboration and IT services. Netviewer will become part of our Online Services division and the acquisition will enable the extension of our SaaS leadership in Europe. The acquisition closed in February 2011 and the total preliminary consideration for this transaction was approximately $115.0 million and was payable in cash. In addition, in connection with the acquisition we converted and assumed approximately 99,100 non vested stock units. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition are currently estimated at $2.5 million, of which we expensed $2.0 million in 2010 and are included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. In process Research and Development for Acquisitions The fair values used in determining the purchase price allocation for certain intangible assets for our acquisitions were based on estimated discounted future cash flows, royalty rates and historical data, among other information. Purchased in process research and development, or IPR&D, of $1.1 million was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition of Vapps because it pertained to technology that was not currently technologically feasible, meaning it had not reached the working model stage, did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product, was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use. The fair value assigned to IPR&D was determined using the income approach, which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a projects sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects. The future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return, which was 21%. The rate of return determination included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the IPR&D. 31 Table of Contents In 2009, we adopted new accounting rules for acquisitions and future IPR&D will be capitalized. No IPR&D was capitalized in 2010 and 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our independent auditors, and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition The accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices, both of which are subject to change. As a result, revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments. In addition, our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information, historical collection experience and economic market conditions. If market conditions continue to decline, or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable, and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments. We license most of our software products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with enhancements and unspecified upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis. Customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates, when not bundled with the initial product license. Customers may also elect to purchase maintenance, technical support, product training or consulting services. We allocate revenue to license updates, maintenance and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the VSOE of fair value, we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered or services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined. We must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates for subscriptions related to new products. In the normal course of business, we are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture. We establish provisions for estimated returns, as well as other sales allowances, concurrently with the recognition of revenue. The provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors, including, among other things, recent and historical return rates for both, specific products and distributors, and the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions. Our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate returns. If actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns, we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user. Product returns are provided for in the consolidated financial statements and have historically been within our expectations. Allowances for estimated product 32 Table of Contents returns amounted to approximately $0.9 million at December 31, 2010 and $1.6 million at December 31, 2009. We also record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives, at the time the sale is recorded. We could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings, which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered. Stock Based Compensation Under the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance, stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period, which is the vesting period. We currently use the Black Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected term of the award, the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends. For purposes of determining the expected volatility factor, we used the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 107. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns. We also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics. The approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options. We do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, accordingly, we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock based payment awards that vest based on service, including those with graded vesting schedules, are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We issue non vested stock units with performance goals to certain senior members of management. The number of non vested stock units underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals. We are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period. If our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change, the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met, no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. As of December 31, 2010, there was $102.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options and non vested stock units. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.20 years. If factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model, the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income, net income and earnings per share. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. The Black Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. These characteristics are not present in our option grants. Existing valuation models, including the Black Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future. Certain stock based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. There is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values. See Notes 2 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 for further information regarding our adoption of the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation. Valuation and Classification of Investments The authoritative guidance, which among other things, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Our investments are carried at fair value and in determining their fair value we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques. The authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. 33 Table of Contents The authoritative guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, described as Level 1, and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs, described as Level 3. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources, such as market quoted prices. When Level 1 observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value, we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances. When valuation techniques, other than those described as Level 1 are utilized, management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments. The degree to which managements estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments, the availability of observable inputs, the frequency of trading in the investments and the investments complexity. If we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments. After we have determined the fair value of our investments, for those that are in an unrealized loss position, we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired. We review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the amortized cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost and our intent to retain or sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may not be until maturity. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, rating agency actions and changes in credit default swap levels. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements and Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements. Product Related Technology Assets We have acquired product related technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements. In applying purchase accounting, we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. We typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets acquired. Such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. We review acquired product related technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology. The recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies. The estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology. Our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products. Actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts. As of December 31, 2010, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value. If these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors, and there is no alternative future use for the technology, we could determine that some or all of their remaining $114.0 million carrying value is impaired. In the event of impairment, we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Goodwill At December 31, 2010, we had $921.1 million in goodwill related to our acquisitions. The goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes. Our revenues are derived from sales of our Enterprise division products which include our Desktop Solutions, Datacenter and Cloud Solutions and related technical services and from sales of our Online Services divisions web collaboration, remote access and support services. The Enterprise division and the Online Services division constitute our two reportable segments. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 for additional information regarding our reportable segments. We evaluate goodwill between these segments, which represent our reporting units. 34 Table of Contents We account for goodwill in accordance with FASBs authoritative guidance which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test. We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the goodwill carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations. There was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2009. Excluding goodwill, we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives. Income Taxes We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $130.0 million in net deferred tax assets. The authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2010, we determined that a $14.0 million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses was necessary. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions, our overall financial performance, operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in Overview and Part 1 Item 1A entitled Risk Factors, which could impact our future performance and financial position. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data and presentation of that data as a percentage of change from year to year.

Revenues Net revenues of our Enterprise division include the following categories: Product Licenses, License Updates and Technical Services. Product Licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major products: Our Desktop Solutions, comprised primarily of our desktop virtualization product XenDesktop and our application virtualization product XenApp; and Our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions, comprised primarily of our application networking products NetScaler, Access Gateway and Branch Repeater and our virtual infrastructure products, XenServer and Essentials for Hyper V. In addition, we offer incentive programs to our VADs and VARs to stimulate demand for our products. Product License revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our VADs and VARs. License Updates consist of fees related to our Subscription Advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 24 months. Subscription Advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades, enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription. Technical Services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term, as well as revenues from product training and certification, and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products, which is recognized as the services are provided. Our Online Services divisions revenues consist of fees related to online service agreements from our web collaboration products which primarily include our GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, Hi Def Audio, and GoToTraining services, our remote access, GoToMyPC, and our remote IT support which primarily include GoToAssist and GoToManage. Our Online Services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. 36 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Revenues: Product licenses $ 619,452 $ 538,975 $ 620,215 $ 80,477 $ (81,240 ) License updates 682,246 604,968 559,340 77,278 45,628 Online services 360,617 308,177 260,065 52,440 48,112 Technical services 212,347 161,968 143,734 50,379 18,234 Total net revenues $ 1,874,662 $ 1,614,088 $ 1,583,354 $ 260,574 $ 30,734 Product Licenses Product License revenue increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions, led by NetScaler,of $41.3 million and increased sales of our Desktop Solutions, led by XenDesktop and related programs of $41.2 million. Product License revenue decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to decreased sales of our Desktop Solutions, primarily XenApp, of $81.5 million. The decrease in XenApp sales in 2009 was driven primarily by weakness in the global economy. We currently expect Product License sales to increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010. License Updates License Updates revenue increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in new Subscription Advantage sales, led by increased XenDesktop product sales. License Updates revenue increased during 2009 when compared to 2008 primarily due to renewals related to our Subscription Advantage program over a larger base of subscribers. We currently anticipate that License Updates revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010 and when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2010 due primarily to renewals of Subscription Advantage. Online Services Online Services revenue increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 and during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to increased sales of our web collaboration products. We currently expect our Online Services revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010 and when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2010 due primarily to sales of our web collaboration products. Technical Services Technical Services revenue increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in support revenues of $22.5 million driven by increased sales of our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions and an increase in consulting revenues of $15.4 million related to increased sales of our Enterprise divisions products. Technical Services revenue increased during 2009 when compared to 2008 primarily due to increased sales of support services related to our Datacenter and Cloud Solutions. We currently expect Technical Services revenues to increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010 consistent with the increase in Product License revenue described above. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenues are primarily comprised of License Updates revenue from Subscription Advantage, Technical Services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts and Online Services revenues from annual service agreements for our Online Services. Deferred revenues increased approximately $160.1 million as of December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 primarily due to increased sales and renewals of our Subscription Advantage product of $102.0 million and increased sales of our support services of $50.3 million. We currently expect deferred revenue to continue to increase in the first quarter of 2011. While it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of any fiscal year. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance. International Revenues International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately 42.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, 43.6% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008. For detailed information on international revenues, please refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. 37 Table of Contents Segment Revenues During the first quarter of 2010, we changed how we measure profitability internally, develop our annual plan and allocate our resources from a geography based approach (which included the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific and our Online Services division), to a product division based approach. This change reflects how we market and sell our products. Accordingly, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we are currently managing and viewing the business. Our revenues are derived from sales of Enterprise division products which primarily include our Desktop Solutions, Datacenter and Cloud Solutions and related technical services and from our Online Services divisions web collaboration, remote access and support services. The Enterprise division and the Online Services division constitute our two reportable segments. An analysis of our reportable segment net revenue is presented below: 00,000,000 00,000,000 00,000,000 00,000,000 00,000,000 Year Ended December 31, RevenueGrowth2009 to 2010 RevenueGrowth2008 to 2009 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Enterprise division $ 1,514,045 $ 1,305,911 $ 1,323,289 15.9 % (1.3 )% Online Services division 360,617 308,177 260,065 17.0 18.5 Consolidated net revenues $ 1,874,662 $ 1,614,088 $ 1,583,354 16.1 1.9 With respect to our segment revenues, the change in net revenues for the comparative periods presented was due primarily to the factors previously discussed above. See Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segment revenues. Cost of Net Revenues 00,000,000 00,000,000 00,000,000 00,000,000 00,000,000 Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to 2009 2009 Compared to 2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Cost of product license revenues $ 66,682 $ 52,160 $ 47,801 $ 14,522 $ 4,359 Cost of services revenues 106,234 87,233 79,303 19,001 7,930 Amortization of product related intangible assets 50,504 47,917 48,028 2,587 (111 ) Total cost of net revenues $ 223,420 $ 187,310 $ 175,132 $ 36,110 $ 12,178 Cost of product license revenues consists primarily of hardware, product media and duplication, manuals, packaging materials, shipping expense and royalties. Cost of services revenue consists primarily of compensation and other personnel related costs of providing technical support and consulting, as well as the costs related to providing our online services. Also included in cost of net revenues is amortization of product related intangible assets. Cost of product license revenues increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 and during 2009 when compared to 2008 primarily due to increased revenue of our Datacenter and Cloud products, many of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other software products. We currently anticipate cost of product license revenues will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010 consistent with product license revenues. Cost of services revenues increased during 2010 compared to 2009 consistent with the increase in revenue of technical services related to our Enterprise products as described above. Cost of services revenues increased $9.5 million during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in revenue of our Online Services. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million during 2009 compared to 2008 due to decreased revenue of our Desktop Solutions consulting and educational services, primarily related to lower XenApp revenue. We currently anticipate cost of services revenues will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010 consistent with the increase in Online Services and Technical Services revenues as discussed above. Gross Margin Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 88.1% for 2010, 88.4% for 2009 and 88.9% for 2008. The slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue for all periods presented was primarily due to the increase in cost of net revenues as discussed above. 38 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Foreign Currency Impact on Operating Expenses A substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to 15 months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. When the dollar is weak, the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts. When the dollar is strong, the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the loss in our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk. Other Items Impacting Operating Expenses Under our 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program, we reduced our headcount by approximately 450 full time positions and consolidated excess facilities. Due to the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program, compensation and employee related costs when comparing 2009 to 2008 decreased by approximately $21.6 million, net of costs related to the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program, across all functional areas including research and development, sales, marketing and services and general and administrative expenses. These savings were partially offset by strategic investments in the business during 2009. For more information regarding the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program, see the Executive Summary above. In addition, during the first quarter of 2009, we revised our methodology for allocating depreciation and certain facilities related costs to more closely align these allocated costs to the employees directly utilizing the assets and facilities. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a reduction to operating expenses of approximately $6.4 million related to an adjustment of payroll taxes initially recorded in conjunction with our voluntary, independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices which were reduced upon agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. Research and Development Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Research and development $ 326,647 $ 281,980 $ 288,109 $ 44,667 $ (6,129 ) Research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs and facility and equipment costs directly related to our research and development activities. We expensed substantially all development costs included in the research and development of our products. Research and development expenses increased during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a $30.9 million increase in compensation and other employee related costs. Also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was a $10.9 million increase in facilities and related depreciation. These increases primarily relate to the strategic hiring of headcount in research and development as discussed above in our Executive Summary. Research and development expenses decreased during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a $17.3 million decrease in compensation and other employee related costs due to the implementation of the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program. Also contributing to the decrease in research and development expenses was an $8.7 million decrease in stock based compensation expense primarily related to vesting of awards assumed in conjunction with our acquisition of XenSource. These decreases were partially offset by a $16.3 million increase in depreciation and facility related costs due primarily to the revised allocation methodology described above and by a $5.2 million increase in compensation expense due to the adjustment of goodwill related to our acquisition of XenSource. Sales, Marketing and Services Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Sales, marketing and services $ 729,754 $ 679,053 $ 669,569 $ 50,701 $ 9,484 39 Table of Contents Sales, marketing and services expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs, including sales commissions, the costs of marketing programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as brand development, advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs and costs related to our facilities, equipment and information systems that are directly related to our sales, marketing and services activities. Sales, marketing and services expenses increased during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a $43.1 million increase in compensation including variable compensation and employee related costs due to additional headcount in our sales force and technical services group. Also contributing to the increase in sales, marketing and services expense was a $13.8 million increase in marketing program costs related to our brand awareness campaigns. Sales, marketing and services expenses increased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a $26.2 million increase in depreciation and other facility related costs due primarily to the revised allocation methodology described above. Also contributing to the increase in sales, marketing and services expenses was a $7.4 million increase in marketing program costs related to our worldwide advertising campaigns, a $3.5 million increase due to an increase in commissions paid to our resellers and a $3.0 million increase due to the settlement of foreign currency contracts during the period which was offset by lower foreign currency denominated expenses due to a stronger U.S. dollar. These increases were partially offset by a $34.5 million decrease in compensation and other employee related costs resulting from the implementation of the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program. For more information see, Overview included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. General and Administrative Expenses Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) General and administrative $ 258,875 $ 239,623 $ 256,679 $ 19,252 $ (17,056 ) General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs and expenses related to outside consultants assisting with information systems, as well as accounting and legal fees. General and administrative expenses increased during 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in compensation and employee related costs due to additional headcount, primarily in IT. General and administrative expenses decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a $26.7 million decrease resulting from the revised methodology of allocating depreciation and other facility related costs as described above (net of current period additions). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal fees of $8.7 million. 2011 Operating Expense Outlook When comparing the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2010 we expect operating expenses to increase across all functional areas, including research and development, sales, marketing and services and general and administrative due to the investments that we have made in headcount and related expenses during 2010. When comparing the fourth quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2011, we expect operating expenses to remain relatively constant. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Amortization of the other intangible assets $ 14,279 $ 20,972 $ 22,724 $ (6,693 ) $ (1,752 ) Amortization of other intangible assets consists of amortization of customer relationships, trade names and covenants not to compete primarily related to our acquisitions. The decrease in amortization of other intangible assets during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to acquired customer related intangible assets becoming fully amortized during 2010. The decrease in amortization of other intangible assets during 2009 as compared to 2008 was not significant. As of December 31, 2010, we had unamortized other identified intangible assets with estimable useful lives in the net amount of $64.2 million. For more information regarding our acquisitions see, Overview and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. 40 Table of Contents Restructuring Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Restructuring $ 971 $ 26,473 $ $(25,502) $ 26,473 On January 28, 2009, we announced the implementation of the 2009 Strategic Restructuring Program, which primarily included the reduction of our headcount by approximately 450 full time positions. During 2009, we incurred a pre tax charge of $26.5 million of which $21.7 million related to severance and other costs directly related to the reduction of our workforce and $4.8 million related to the consolidation of certain of our facilities. The restructuring program was substantially completed by the end of 2009. For more information see, Overview and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Interest income $ 14,577 $ 14,683 $ 31,506 $(106) $(16,823) The decrease in interest income during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher overall average cash and investment balances during the year. Interest income decreased during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates earned on cash equivalents and investment balances. For more information see Overview and Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Other (Expense) Income, Net Year Ended December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2009Compared to2008 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Other (expense) income, net $ (1,015) $ 958 $(4,140) $(1,973) $ 5,098 Other (expense) income, net is primarily comprised of remeasurement of foreign currency transaction gains (losses) and realized gains (losses) related to changes in the fair value of our investments that have a decline in fair value that is considered other than temporary, if any, and recognized gains (losses) related to available for sale investments. Other (expense) income, net increased when comparing 2010 to 2009 primarily due to losses recognized on prepayments at par of securities purchased at a premium within our available for sale investment portfolio. Other (expense) income, net decreased when comparing 2009 to 2008 primarily due to foreign exchange gains related to financial statement remeasurement of $10.1 million and a decrease in losses on investments that were determined to have an other than temporary decline in value of $1.5 million. These decreases in other (expense) income were partially offset by an increase in losses related to our foreign currency transactions of $5.7 million. For more information see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Income Taxes We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to federal income taxes in the U.S. as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2004. In 2010, our effective tax rate increased to approximately 19.1% from (8.6)% when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2010 to the three months ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to a larger benefit from higher tax credits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2009. When comparing the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 to the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, our effective tax rate increased to 17.2% from 1.5% primarily due to a larger benefit from higher tax credits recognized in 2009 and to a lesser extent higher income in geographic locations taxed at a higher rate. We establish tax reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain of these positions may be challenged. While it is often difficult to predict whether we will prevail, we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable 41 Table of Contents outcome of known contingencies. As such, included in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 is an additional tax reserve of approximately $18.9 million related to uncertainties arising from current and prior tax years partially offset by a reduction of approximately $1.2 million in tax reserves related to the expiration of a statute of limitations for the 2006 tax year. As of December 31, 2010, our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaled approximately $63.9 million. There was $1.5 million included in the balance at December 31, 2010 for tax positions, which would not affect the annual effective tax rate and approximately $1.3 million of accrued interest on tax positions, which is included in income tax expense. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance, however, that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate. In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain and judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In June 2010, we reached a settlement in principle with the IRS regarding certain previously disclosed income tax deficiencies asserted in a Revenue Agents Report, or RAR. Under the terms of the settlement in principle, we would agree to an assessment of income tax deficiencies in full settlement of all open claims under the RAR and would resolve with finality for future years all of the transfer pricing issues raised in the RAR. Based on this, we incurred a charge of $13.1 million in 2010 in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Among other things, the authoritative guidance requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and non recognition of tax positions. It further requires that a change in management judgment related to prior years tax positions be recognized in the quarter of such change. The final settlement requires the finalization of tax deficiency calculations with the IRS and a written agreement signed by the IRS. It is uncertain how long it will take to reach a final settlement with the IRS. There can be no assurances that a final written agreement will be obtained or that this matter will otherwise be resolved in our favor. An adverse outcome of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $130.0 million in net deferred tax assets. The authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2010, we determined that $14.0 million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes. We maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates. We do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2010, we generated positive operating cash flows of $616.3 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $276.4 million, adjusted for, among other things, non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of $138.2 million, stock based compensation expense of $103.8 million and the tax effect of stock based compensation of $51.5 million. Also contributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $144.8 million, net of the effects of acquisitions. These operating cash inflows are partially offset by the excess benefit from the exercise of stock options of $60.2 million and $46.7 million related to a deferred income tax benefit. Our investing activities used $457.0 million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for net purchases of investments of $335.0 million. Also contributing to these cash outflows is the purchase of property and equipment of $75.4 million and $46.7 million in cash paid for licensing agreements, acquisitions and other assets. Our financing activities used cash of $26.3 million, primarily from expenditures on our stock repurchase program of $433.7 million partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of $353.6 million and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $60.2 million. During 2009, we generated positive operating cash flows of $484.0 million. These cash flows related primarily to net income of $191.0 million, adjusted for, among other things, non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of $138.6 million, stock based compensation expense of $111.4 million and a goodwill adjustment of $5.4 million. Also contributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of $87.6 million, net of the effects of acquisitions. These 42 Table of Contents operating cash inflows are partially offset by $50.8 million related to a deferred income tax benefit, the tax effect of stock based compensation of $7.9 million and the excess benefit from the exercise of stock options of $5.2 million. Our investing activities used $502.9 million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for net purchases of investments of $412.7 million. Also contributing to these cash outflows is the purchase of property and equipment of $76.2 million. Our financing activities used cash of $45.5 million, primarily from expenditures on our stock repurchase program of $214.9 million partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of $166.0 million. Historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2011. We believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives. We could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions. Cash and Investments December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) Cash and investments $ 1,685,659 $ 1,207,257 $ 478,402 The increase in cash and investments at December 31, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009, is primarily due to cash provided by our operating activities of $616.3 million and cash received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of $353.6 million partially offset by expenditures made on our stock repurchases of $433.7 million and purchases of property and equipment of $75.4 million. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs. Our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities. See Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 for further information. Trading Investments We held municipal auction rate securities, the majority of which were triple A rated, whose underlying assets were generally student loans that were substantially backed by the federal government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program through investment accounts managed by UBS Financial Services, Inc., or UBS. The market for municipal auction rate securities in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures in 2008. In November 2008, we formally accepted the terms of a settlement, or the Settlement, from UBS. Upon accepting the terms of the Settlement, we received an enforceable, non transferrable right, or the Put Option, that enabled us to sell our auction rate securities back to UBS. On June 30, 2010, we exercised the Put Option and sold all of our remaining investments in auction rate securities back to UBS at par. During 2010, we realized a gain of $6.0 million related to the sale of our investments in auction rate securities and a corresponding loss of $6.0 million related to the settlement of the Put Option, both of which are included in other (expense) income, net, in our consolidated statements of income. See Notes 4 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements The authoritative guidance defines fair value as an exit price, representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis We measure our cash flow hedges at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets and we generally measure our investments in available for sale securities at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. 43 Table of Contents We currently hold one available for sale investment for which quoted prices are not readily available, our $50.0 million face value investment issued by AIG Matched Funding Corporation, or the AIG Capped Floater. In order to measure the AIG Capped Floater at fair value we used a discounted cash flow model. We then discounted those cash flows at a rate reflecting the market risk inherent in holding an AIG security with a similar maturity as evidenced by pricing in the markets. Since utilizing a discounted cash flow model required us to make assumptions that were not directly or indirectly observable regarding the AIG Capped Floaters fair value. Accordingly, it is a Level 3 valuation and is included in the table below. Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Put Option Long termInvestments Total (In thousands) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 6,048 $ 83,785 $ 89,833 Proceeds received on Level 3 securities (44,560 ) (44,560 ) Decrease in previously recognized unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 4,244 4,244 Total realized (losses) gains included in earnings (6,048 ) 5,871 (177 ) Balance at December 31, 2010 $ $ 49,340 $ 49,340 Realized (losses) gains included in earnings for the period are reported in other (expense) income net.

Accounts Receivable, Net December 31, 2010Compared to2009 2010 2009 (In thousands) Accounts receivable $ 382,654 $ 309,748 $ 72,906 Allowance for returns (850 ) (1,617 ) 767 Allowance for doubtful accounts (3,409 ) (3,219 ) (190 ) Accounts receivable, net $ 378,395 $ 304,912 $ 73,483 The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 was primarily due to an increase in sales, particularly in the last month of 2010 compared to the last month of 2009. The increase in our allowance for returns when comparing 2010 to 2009 was not significant. The activity in our allowance for returns was comprised of $3.2 million in credits issued for returns during 2010 offset by $2.4 million of provisions for returns recorded during 2010. Our allowance for doubtful accounts remained relatively constant when comparing 2010 to 2009. The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts was primarily comprised of additional provisions for doubtful accounts of $2.0 million recorded during the year partially offset by $1.8 million of uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries during the year. From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and medium sized businesses. If the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2010, one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted for 17% of our accounts receivable. At December 31, 2009, one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted for 14% of our accounts receivable. For more information regarding significant customers see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Credit Facility Effective on August 9, 2005, we entered into a revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with a group of financial institutions, or the Lenders. Effective September 27, 2006, we entered into an amendment and restatement of the Credit Facility, or the Amendment. The Amendment decreased the overall range of interest we will pay on amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility and lowered the facility fee. In addition, the Amendment extended the term of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility, as amended, allows us to increase the revolving credit commitment up to a maximum aggregate revolving credit commitment of $175.0 million. The Credit Facility, as amended, will expire on September 27, 2011 and it currently provides for a revolving line of credit in the aggregate amount of $100.0 million, subject to continued covenant compliance. A portion of the revolving line of credit (1) in the aggregate amount of $25.0 million may be available for issuances of letters of credit and (2) in the aggregate amount of $15.0 million may be available for swing line loans. The Credit Facility, as amended, currently bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or 44 Table of Contents LIBOR, plus 0.32% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.32% to 0.80% above LIBOR based on the level of our total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. In addition, we are required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% based on the aggregate amount available under the Credit Facility, as amended, and the level of our total debt and adjusted EBITDA. During the year ended December 31, 2010, no borrowings were made under the Credit Facility, as amended, and as of December 31, 2010 there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, as amended. The Credit Facility, as amended, contains customary default provisions, and we must comply with various financial and non financial covenants. The financial covenants consist of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The primary non financial covenants contain certain limits on our ability to pay dividends, conduct certain mergers or acquisitions, make certain investments and loans, incur future indebtedness or liens, alter our capital structure or sell stock or assets. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Facility. Stock Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of $2.5 billion. We may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted. The objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders returns. At December 31, 2010, approximately $120.3 million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock. A portion of the funds used to repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds. Additionally, from time to time, we have entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares. These programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we expended approximately $434.8 million on open market purchases, repurchasing 8,157,400 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $53.31. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, we made an up front payment of $15.0 million to a financial institution related to a structured stock repurchase agreement. At the maturity of the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2010, we received $16.1 million in cash, including premiums, and did not take delivery of any shares related to the agreement due to market conditions. As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any prepaid notional amounts outstanding related to our structured stock repurchase programs. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we expended approximately $214.9 million on open market purchases, repurchasing 6,475,830 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $33.19.As of December 31, 2009, we did not have any prepaid notional amounts outstanding under our structured stock repurchase programs and during the year we did not make any up front payments to financial institutions related to structured stock repurchase agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we took delivery of 4,406,757 shares at an average price of $33.30 per share from our structured repurchase agreements and we expended approximately $197.6 million on open market purchases repurchasing 6,451,591 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $30.63. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have any prepaid notional amounts outstanding under our structured stock repurchase programs. Shares for Tax Withholding During the year ended December 31, 2010, we withheld 123,489 shares from vested stock units totaling $6.3 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations that arose on the vesting of stock units. These shares are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet and the related cash outlays reduce our total repurchase authority. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we withheld 46,732 shares from vested stock units totaling $1.8 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations that arose on the vesting of stock units. These shares are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheet and the related cash outlays reduce our total repurchase authority. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Contractual Obligations We have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Other items, such as operating lease obligations, are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 45 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements (in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 259,636 $ 57,441 $ 93,746 $ 67,333 $ 41,116 Purchase obligations (1) 18,082 18,082 Total contractual obligations (2) $ 277,718 $ 75,523 $ 93,746 $ 67,333 $ 41,116 (1) Purchase obligations represent non cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year end of approximately $9.7 million and a contingent obligation to purchase inventory, which is based on amount of usage, of approximately $8.4 million. (2) Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes $63.9 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance, because we could not make reasonably reliable estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010 for further information. As of December 31, 2010, we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Commitments Capital expenditures were $75.4 million during 2010, $76.2 million during 2009 and $181.0 million during 2008. During 2010 and 2009, capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities and leasehold improvements. Office Leases We have operating lease obligations through 2018 related to two properties that are not utilized. At December 31, 2010, the total remaining obligation on these lease obligations was approximately $6.4 million, of which $2.9 million was accrued as of December 31, 2010, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. In calculating these accruals, we made estimates, based on market information, including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities. We periodically re evaluate our estimates related to the vacant facilities. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. The analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events, gains or losses. We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. To mitigate foreign currency risk, we utilize derivative financial instruments. The counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2010. Actual results could differ materially. Discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in Notes 2 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Exposure to Exchange Rates A substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies, including Euros, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, Australian dollars, Swiss francs, Indian rupees, Hong Kong dollars, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars and Chinese renminbi. To reduce our exposure to a reduction in U.S. dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, we have established a hedging program. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures. Our hedging program significantly reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. 46 Table of Contents At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of $98.5 million and $33.6 million, respectively, and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of $244.7 million and $224.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2010, these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of $6.4 million and at December 31, 2009, these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of $4.8 million. Based on a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2010 market rates, the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by $15.3 million, resulting in a net liability position. Conversely, a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2010 market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by $15.3 million. In these hypothetical movements, foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction. This calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. In addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above, changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive. We do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts. Exposure to Interest Rates We have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale. We maintain available for sale investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument. The securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged. The securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income. If market interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points from December 31, 2010 and 2009 levels, the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately $15.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively. If market interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points from December 31, 2010 and 2009 levels, the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately $8.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios. This analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. During 2005, we entered into the Credit Facility, as amended in 2006, or the Amended Credit Facility. Accordingly, we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt. This exposure relates to our $100.0 million Amended Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR plus 0.32% and adjusts in the future in the range of 0.32% to 0.80% above LIBOR based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA. A hypothetical 1% interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we had no amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010.
