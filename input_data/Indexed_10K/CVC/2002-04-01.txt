ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. This Annual Report contains or incorporates by reference statements that constitute forward looking information within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties and that actual results or developments may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of various factors. Factors that may cause such differences to occur include but are not limited to: the level of the Companys revenues; subscriber demand and growth, including demand for and growth of our digital cable service, which are impacted by competition from other services, such as DBS, and the other factors set forth below; the cost of programming and industry conditions; the regulatory environment in which the Company operates; general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate; demand for advertising time and space; the level of capital expenditures and whether our capital expenditures increase as expected; the level of our expenses, including costs of our new services, such as expenses related to the introduction of our digital services; pending and future acquisitions and dispositions of assets; market demand for new services; whether any pending uncompleted transactions are completed on the terms and at the times set forth (if at all); competition from existing competitors and new competitors entering the Companys franchise areas; other risks and uncertainties inherent in the cable television business, the programming and entertainment businesses and the Companys other businesses; financial community and rating agency perceptions of the Companys business, operations, financial condition and the industry in which it operates; and the factors described in Cablevisions filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained therein. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise the forward looking statements contained or incorporated by reference herein, except as otherwise required by applicable federal securities laws. (38) CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: RESTRUCTURING CHARGE: In 2001, the Company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations in accordance with a plan approved by the Board of Directors and communicated to potentially affected employees. The costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services, and provisions for lease termination costs, including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances. Costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis, giving effect to the announced severance plan. Costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals. Changes in estimates, as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered, will be reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charge, separately reported and identified. INTER GROUP ALLOCATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS: The Company has included combined financial data for each of the Rainbow Media Group and Cablevision NY Group in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements. The combined financial data of Rainbow Media Group and Cablevision NY Group reflect the application of certain allocation and cash management policies of Cablevision. Certain costs of Cablevision, including general and administrative costs, such as costs of maintaining corporate headquarters, facilities and common support functions, have been allocated by Cablevision to the groups generally based upon specific usage measured by proportionate headcount or square footage or based upon managements estimate of the level of effort expended on each business unit based on historical trends. These allocation policies are described in detail in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. Cablevisions board of directors may modify or rescind any of these allocation policies without the approval of the stockholders, although no such changes have been made in the reported results or are currently contemplated. Any such changes adopted by the board of directors would be made on the basis of its good faith business judgment of Cablevisions best interests, taking into consideration the best interests of all Cablevision shareholders. Management believes that these allocations have been made on a reasonable basis. However, it is not practicable to determine whether the allocated amounts represent amounts that (39) might have been incurred on a stand alone basis, as there are no company specific or comparable industry benchmarks with which to make such estimates. The Company has attributed certain of its assets and operations to either Cablevision NY Group or Rainbow Media Group. As previously disclosed, in its discretion, the Company may change the attribution of these assets and operations between the groups. In addition, the Cablevision NY Group provides services to and receives services from the Rainbow Media Group. As many of these transactions are conducted between subsidiaries under common control of Cablevision, amounts charged for these services have not necessarily been based upon arms length negotiations and do not necessarily represent the amounts that would be charged by unaffiliated third parties. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS: The Companys long lived assets at December 31, 2001 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired of approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $1.1 billion of other intangible assets. Such assets accounted for approximately 25% of the Companys consolidated total assets. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangibles the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and will be required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2002, and then on a periodic basis thereafter. See "Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards." During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $99.9 million and $47.5 million representing the balance of goodwill related to certain theaters of Clearview Cinemas. In 1999, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $35.5 million representing the balance of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of certain assets associated with The WIZ store locations. VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS: Deferred tax assets resulted primarily from the Companys historical net operating losses. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences between book and tax or net operating loss carry forwards become deductible. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. In 2001 and 2000, the Company reduced the valuation allowances related to its net deferred tax assets by $310 million and $193 million (40) respectively. Future changes to the valuation allowance will depend on estimates of, and assumptions relating to, the Companys future level of taxable income.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION REVENUES, NET for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $6.5 million as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decrease in revenue attributable to the Transactions................................... $ (257.4) Increase in revenue from developing cable modem and telephone businesses............... 112.9 Decrease in retail electronics sales................................................... (14.8) Higher revenue per cable television subscriber......................................... 71.9 Increased revenue in Rainbow Media Holdings programming services excluding Madison Square Garden........................................................................ 93.5 Decrease in Madison Square Gardens revenue............................................ (34.5) Increased revenue attributable to internal growth in the average number of cable television subscribers............................................................... 25.5 Increase in deferred revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home................................................................ 6.9 Other net decreases.................................................................... (10.5) $ (6.5) TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES for 2001 increased $70.1 million (4%) compared to 2000. An increase of $156.6 million resulted from increased costs directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers referred to above and an increase of $48.8 million resulted from costs relating to certain Knicks player transactions at Madison Square Garden. These increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately $105.3 million attributable to the Transactions and a $30.0 million decrease attributable to a settlement from YankeeNets (see discussion below). As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 1% during 2001 as compared to 2000. RETAIL ELECTRONICS COST OF SALES amounted to approximately $563.4 million (83% of retail electronics sales) for 2001 compared to approximately $550.0 million (81% of retail electronics sales) for 2000. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred and certain occupancy and buying costs, for the Companys retail electronics segment. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES decreased $44.4 million (4%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The net decrease for 2001 was comprised of a $109.2 million decrease in expenses related to the Companys stock plan, a $10.3 million decrease related to a long term incentive plan (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied), a decrease of approximately $52.3 million attributable to the Transactions and a decrease of approximately $3.5 million due to lower Year 2000 remediation costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately $130.9 million that resulted primarily from additional customer service, sales and marketing and administrative costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan, the long term incentive plan and the Year 2000 remediation costs, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 2% during 2001 as compared to 2000. (44) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES of $56.4 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE increased $123.0 million (12%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. Approximately $92.1 million of the net increase was due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets, partially offset by decreases from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Approximately $42.1 million of the increase resulted from higher impairment charges related to goodwill and capitalized software. (The 2001 amount included a $99.9 million write off of goodwill recorded in connection with the Clearview acquisition. The 2000 amount included a $47.5 million write off of Clearview goodwill and a $10.3 million write off of capitalized software costs). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.2 million which resulted from the Transactions. NET INTEREST EXPENSE decreased $36.6 million (7%) during 2001 compared to 2000. The net decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and an increase in interest income, partly offset by higher overall average debt balances. EQUITY IN NET LOSS OF AFFILIATES increased to $68.0 million in 2001 from $16.7 million in 2000. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company has varying minority ownership interests. The increase resulted primarily from the Companys share of the net losses of Northcoast Communications and R/L DBS, which share amounted to $43.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively, in 2001. In 2000, the Companys share of the net loss of Northcoast Communications was $2.5 million. GAIN ON SALE OF CABLE ASSETS AND PROGRAMMING INTERESTS, NET for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists primarily of a gain of $1,441.7 million recognized on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Massachusetts and a gain of $746.3 million from the sale of a 20% minority interest in certain of the Companys programming businesses, partly offset by a $12.1 million adjustment to the gain on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Ohio. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recognized gains of $1,204.2 million from the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Kalamazoo, Michigan and Ohio and $5.7 million from the sale of certain programming assets. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON INVESTMENTS for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 consists of the following: 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys At Home warrants.......................................................... $ (108.5) $ (139.7) Charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of Salon.com common stock.............................................................. (.4) (6.7) $ (108.9) $ (146.4) (45) GAIN ON INVESTMENTS, NET for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists of the following: (dollars in millions) Change in the fair value of Charter, Adelphia, AT&T and AT&T Wireless common stock ...................................................................... $ (176.6) Gain recognized in connection with the reclassification of the shares of Charter and Adelphia common stock from securities available for sale to trading securities upon the adoption of SFAS 133.................................... 286.4 $ 109.8 WRITE OFF OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS of $18.8 million in 2001 and $5.2 million in 2000 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, the Companys credit agreements and the redemption of the Companys senior subordinated notes. GAIN ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, NET of $281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists principally of $250.4 million of unrealized gains due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications shares, and $31.4 million due to unrealized and realized gains on its interest rate swap contracts. LOSS ON REDEMPTION OF NOTES of $15.3 million in 2001 consists principally of the premium paid to redeem the Companys $300 million face value 9 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2005 and its $150 million face value 9 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006. GAIN ON TERMINATION OF AT HOME AGREEMENT of $25.2 million consists primarily of the recognition of the remaining unamortized deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 relating to warrants previously received from At Home. MINORITY INTERESTS for the year ended December 31, 2001 include CSC Holdings preferred stock dividend requirements, Fox Sports Networks share of the net loss of Regional Programming Partners, MGMs share of the net income or loss of American Movie Classics, Bravo, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment and NBCs share of the net income of Rainbow Media Holdings. For 2000, minority interests include CSC Holdings preferred stock dividend requirements, Fox Sports Networks share of the net income of Regional Programming Partners and NBCs share of the net loss of Rainbow Media Holdings. NET MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSE increased to $18.1 million for 2001 compared to $9.5 million for 2000. The increase was due primarily to increased losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets. INCOME TAX EXPENSE amounted to $187.7 million and $42.5 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and resulted from the Transactions, partially offset by a reduction in the tax valuation allowance of $310.1 million and $192.6 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company did not reduce its valuation allowance in excess of these amounts due to uncertainties regarding the realizability of the deferred tax asset. (46) BUSINESS SEGMENTS RESULTS CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION The Company classifies its business interests into four segments: Telecommunication Services, consisting principally of its cable television, telephone and modem services operations; Rainbow Media Group, consisting principally of interests in national and regional cable television programming networks; Madison Square Garden, which owns and operates professional sports teams, regional cable television networks, live productions and entertainment venues; and Retail Electronics, which represents the operations of Cablevision Electronics retail electronics stores. The Company allocates certain costs to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services. The financial information for the segments does not include inter segment eliminations. TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys telecommunication services segment. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 % of Net % of Net Amount Revenues Amount Revenues (dollars in millions) Revenues, net...................................... $ 2,275,525 100% $ 2,328,194 100% Technical and operating expenses................... 908,031 40 929,531 40 Selling, general and administrative expenses....... 450,490 20 508,761 22 Restructuring charges.............................. 7,862 Depreciation and amortization...................... 706,237 31 644,485 28 Operating income.............................. $ 202,905 9% $ 245,417 11% REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $52.7 million (2%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decrease in revenue attributable to the Transactions.................................... $ (259.6) Increase in revenue from developing cable modem and telephone businesses................ 112.9 Higher revenue per cable television subscriber.......................................... 71.9 Increased revenue attributable to internal growth in the average number of cable television subscribers................................................................ 25.5 Increase in deferred revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home................................................................. 6.9 Other net decreases..................................................................... (10.3) $ (52.7) (47) TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES for 2001 decreased $21.5 million (2%) compared to 2000. A $106.1 million decrease attributable to the Transactions was partially offset by increased costs of approximately $84.6 million directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers referred to above. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained relatively constant during 2001 as compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES decreased $58.3 million (11%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The net decrease for 2001 consisted of decreases of $53.6 million which resulted from the Transactions, $55.4 million attributable to lower expenses relating to a stock plan, and $5.2 million attributable to lower expenses relating to a long term incentive plan (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied), partially offset by increases in various costs aggregating $55.9 million, primarily attributable to the Companys developing cable modem business. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% for 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan and the long term incentive plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 1% during 2001 compared to 2000. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES of $7.9 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE increased $61.8 million (10%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The increase was comprised of a net increase of approximately $73.4 million due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets, partially offset by decreases from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized and a decrease of $11.6 million which resulted from the Transactions. RAINBOW MEDIA GROUP Refer to "Rainbow Media Group" discussion below. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for Madison Square Garden. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 % of Net % of Net Amount Revenues Amount Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net...................................... $ 841,912 100% $ 876,397 100% Technical and operating expenses................... 612,891 73 579,417 66 Selling, general and administrative expenses....... 143,113 17 140,390 16 Restructuring...................................... 2,750 Depreciation and amortization...................... 96,259 11 114,537 13 Operating income (loss)....................... $ (13,101) (2)% $ 42,053 5% REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $34.5 million (4%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. This decline was primarily attributable to lower sales resulting from (48) a change in the mix of events presented at MSGs arena, together with fewer shows at Radio City Music Hall. As a result of a decline in New York City tourism, attendance was also lower at the Companys holiday shows at Radio City Music Hall and the Theater at Madison Square Garden. In addition, revenues were lower as a show tour ended in April 2001. Knicks playoff revenues were lower in 2001 as the team was eliminated in the first round of the NBA playoffs as compared to advancing to the third round in the same period of the prior year and the Rangers revenues were lower in 2001 due to the receipt of National Hockey League expansion revenue in 2000. Partially offsetting these declines were higher revenues for Radio City Entertainments Christmas Show performances outside New York City, as well as higher revenues at MSG Networks primarily resulting from increased affiliate fees, partially offset by a decline in advertising revenues. TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $33.5 million (6%) over the same 2000 period. This increase is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2001 for certain player transactions, higher team compensation, as well as higher contractual rights expense in MSG Networks. Commencing with the 2001/2002 season, Knick player compensation, as well as the provision for certain player transactions, includes a provision for a luxury tax which is expected to be owed to the National Basketball Association at the end of the season. Partially offsetting this increase in technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 was a credit of $30.0 million as a result of the settlement of litigation with the YankeeNets. As a result of the settlement, Madison Square Garden received $30.0 million from YankeeNets in 2001 and Madison Square Gardens rights to telecast New York Yankee games ended at the conclusion of the 2001 baseball season. Also offsetting the increase is a decrease in costs directly associated with the changes in revenues discussed above. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $2.7 million (2%) as compared to the 2000 level. This increase is primarily due to a higher provision for severance, increased legal and professional fees associated with the YankeeNets litigation and other general cost increases, partially offset by a $15.8 million decrease in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of expense related to Cablevisions stock plan and a $2.4 million decrease in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of expense related to Cablevisions long term incentive plan (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied). RESTRUCTURING CHARGES of $2.8 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $18.3 million (16%) as compared to 2000 due primarily to lower amortization expense as certain intangibles assets have been fully amortized. RETAIL ELECTRONICS The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys retail electronics segment, Cablevision Electronics. (49) Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 % of Net % of Net Amount Revenues Amount Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net...................................... $ 678,571 100% $ 693,354 100% Cost of sales...................................... 563,423 83 565,643 82 Selling, general and administrative expenses....... 190,236 28 186,452 27 Restructuring charges.............................. 13,720 2 Depreciation and amortization...................... 32,907 5 29,729 4 Operating loss................................ $ (121,715) (18)% $ (88,470) (13)% REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $14.8 million (2%) to approximately $678.6 million, compared to revenues of approximately $693.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The net decrease for the year ended December 31, 2001 was comprised of a decrease of $29.7 million in cable modem sales no longer being recorded in the retail electronics segment, partially offset by an increase in comparable store sales of $2.7 million and an increase of $12.2 million in revenues from new and relocated stores. COST OF SALES for the year ended December 31, 2001 amounted to approximately $563.4 million (83% of revenues) compared to costs of sales of $565.6 million (82% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Such costs include the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred as well as certain occupancy and buying costs. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily attributable to a $17.1 million write down of inventory as a result of the Companys decision to implement a new merchandising strategy. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES amounted to approximately $190.2 million (28% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $186.5 million (27% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase was primarily attributable to increased professional fees and employee related expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of retail store expenses (excluding certain store occupancy costs), salaries and commissions of store personnel, advertising expenses, operation of the distribution center and corporate support functions other than buying. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES of $13.7 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE amounted to approximately $32.9 million (5% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $29.7 million (4% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. The increase in 2001 of $3.2 million resulted primarily from depreciation of new asset additions. (50) COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 VERSUS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $468.1 million (12%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. Approximately $236.1 million (6%) was from increases in revenue sources such as Rainbow Media Holdings programming and entertainment services, advertising on the Companys cable television systems, revenue derived from the developing cable modem and telephone businesses and deferred revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home; approximately $81.5 million (2%) resulted from higher revenue per subscriber; approximately $78.8 million (2%) resulted from higher retail electronics revenue and approximately $36.4 million (1%) of the increase was attributable to the Transactions. The remaining increase of $35.3 million (1%) was attributable to internal growth of 65,800 in the average number of subscribers during the year. TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES for 2000 increased $161.5 million (11%) over the 1999 amount. Approximately $135.4 million (9%) reflected increased costs directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers discussed above, as well as increases in programming costs for cable television services, with the remaining $26.1 million (2%) attributable to the Transactions. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained relatively constant during 2000 as compared to 1999. RETAIL ELECTRONICS COST OF SALES amounted to approximately $550.0 million (81% of retail electronics sales) for 2000, compared to approximately $484.8 million (80% of retail electronics sales) for 1999. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred, as well as store occupancy and buying costs for the retail electronics segment. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES decreased $24.2 million (2%) for 2000 as compared to the 1999 level. The change from the prior year resulted from decreases of approximately $159.5 million (13%) reflecting lower charges related to an incentive and stock plan and approximately $37.2 million (3%) due to lower Year 2000 remediation costs. Partially offsetting these decreases were net increases of approximately $129.4 million (11%) resulting from higher administrative, sales and marketing and customer service costs, approximately $38.5 million (3%) to expense the unamortized portion of deferred acquisition costs related to the Companys cable modem program and approximately $4.6 million directly attributable to the Transactions. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% in 2000 compared to 1999. Excluding the effects of the incentive stock plan and Year 2000 remediation costs, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 2% during 2000 as compared to 1999. OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION increased $265.5 million (37%) to $985.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $719.7 million for the comparable period in 1999. Approximately $159.5 million (22%) resulted from lower costs related to an incentive and stock plan and approximately $106.0 million (15%) resulted from the combined effect of the revenue and expense changes discussed above. On a pro forma basis, giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 1999 and excluding the Companys systems held for sale, the incentive and stock plan costs referred to above, the charge related to cable modems discussed above, and the costs of Year 2000 remediation, operating profit before depreciation and amortization would have increased 12.0% in 2000. Operating profit before (51) depreciation and amortization is presented here to provide additional information about the Companys ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for net income (loss) and cash flows as indicators of financial performance and liquidity as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE increased $124.4 million (14%) during 2000 as compared to 1999. Approximately $22.3 million (3%) resulted from higher impairment charges related to goodwill and capitalized software costs. (The 2000 amount included a $47.5 million write off of goodwill which resulted from the Clearview acquisition and $10.3 million from the write off of capitalized software costs. The 1999 amount included a $35.5 million write off of goodwill related to the acquisition of The WIZ stores). As discussed in `Liquidity and Capital Resources, continued and projected operating losses in the retail electronics operations will require significant additional financial support from CSC Holdings. In addition, if current trends continue, the Clearview theater operations will require additional support from CSC Holdings. Approximately $83.0 million (9%) resulted primarily from depreciation on new plant assets. The remaining $19.1 million (2%) of the increase was directly attributable to the Transactions. NET INTEREST EXPENSE increased $96.9 million (21%) during 2000 compared to 1999. The net increase is primarily attributable to higher debt incurred to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures and higher interest rates. EQUITY IN NET LOSS OF AFFILIATES decreased to $16.7 million in 2000 from $19.2 million in 1999. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net profits and losses of certain programming businesses and a personal communication services business in which the Company has varying minority ownership interests. GAIN ON SALE OF CABLE ASSETS AND PROGRAMMING INTERESTS for the year ended December 31, 2000 consists of a gain of $1,204.2 million from the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Kalamazoo, Michigan and Ohio and $5.7 million from the sale of certain programming assets. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON INVESTMENTS for the year ended December 31, 2000 consists of a charge of $139.7 million relating to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys At Home warrants and a charge of $6.7 million relating to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys investment in Salon.com. The 1999 impairment charge of $15.1 million resulted from the write off of an investment held by Rainbow Media Holdings. GAIN ON INVESTMENTS, NET for the year ended December 31, 1999 of $10.9 million resulted from the sale of certain investments. WRITE OFF OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS of $5.2 million in 2000 and $4.4 million in 1999 consist principally of the write off of deferred financing costs in connection with amendments to or termination of the Companys credit agreements. MINORITY INTERESTS for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 include CSC Holdings preferred stock dividend requirements, Fox Sports Networks 40% share of the net income of (52) Regional Programming Partners, ITTs share of the net loss of Madison Square Garden through April 8, 1999 and NBCs share of the net loss of Rainbow Media Holdings. INCOME TAX EXPENSE for 2000 includes a $42.5 million income tax provision resulting from the Transactions. In 2000, the Company reduced its valuation allowance by $192.6 million to offset the deferred tax liability resulting from the 2000 dispositions. The Company did not reduce its valuation allowance in excess of this amount due to uncertainties regarding the realizability of the deferred tax asset. In 1999, the Company recorded $6.6 million related to federal, state and local income taxes. In 1999, the Company increased its tax valuation allowance by $211.8 million due to uncertainties regarding the realizability of the deferred tax asset.

(57) CSC HOLDINGS, INC. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In April 1999, Cablevision contributed the cable television systems acquired from Tele Communications, Inc. ("TCI Systems") on March 4, 1998 to CSC Holdings. This transaction was accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests, whereby the assets and liabilities of the TCI Systems were recorded at historical book value. Prior period consolidated financial statements of CSC Holdings have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations of the TCI Systems from March 4, 1998. As a result, the operations of CSC Holdings are identical to the operations of Cablevision Systems Corporation, except for dividends attributable to the preferred stock of CSC Holdings which have been reported in minority interests in the consolidated financial statements of Cablevision. Refer to Cablevisions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. RAINBOW MEDIA GROUP MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Rainbow Media Group tracking stock represents an interest in Cablevision and is not a direct interest in the businesses and interests included in Rainbow Media Group. Dividends (if any), entitlements in the event of a merger or similar transaction and rights in liquidation will not necessarily be related to the performance of Rainbow Media Group or the value of the assets in Rainbow Media Group. Instead, such determinations will be made by the Cablevision Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of Cablevisions amended certificate of incorporation. The Company does not expect to pay any dividends on any series of Cablevision common stock for the foreseeable future. In connection with the preparation of the financial information for the Rainbow Media Group tracking stock, certain allocations of Cablevision costs have been made based on existing policies. If those policies were altered, which Cablevision is entitled to do at any time, there could be material adverse effects on the Rainbow Media Group financial statements.

Approximately $72.8 million of the increase was attributed to growth in programming network subscribers and rate increases, approximately $27.6 million of the increase was due to higher advertising revenue and the remaining $3.7 million of the increase was due primarily to the Transactions. TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $58.9 million (31%) compared to 2000. Approximately $44.8 million resulted from increased costs directly associated with the net increases in revenues discussed above. The remaining $14.1 million was directly attributable to the Transactions. As a percentage of revenues, such costs increased 3% during 2001 compared to 2000. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES increased $15.7 million (8%) for 2001 compared to 2000. An increase of approximately $25.6 million resulted from higher sales, marketing, advertising and other general cost increases and an increase of approximately $13.9 million was attributable to the Transactions. These increases were partially offset by a $23.4 million decrease in charges attributed to Rainbow Media Group related to a stock plan of Cablevision and a $0.4 million decrease in charges attributed to Rainbow Media Group related to a long term incentive plan of Cablevision. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan and the long term incentive plan, as a percentage of revenue, such expenses increased 1%. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES of $11.7 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with facility realignment. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE decreased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, when compared to 2000. This decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during 2000. NET INTEREST EXPENSE decreased $39.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is primarily attributable to lower debt balances. EQUITY IN NET LOSS OF AFFILIATES decreased to $5.2 million in 2001 from $16.0 million in 2000. Such amounts consist of Rainbow Media Groups share of the net profits and losses of certain programming businesses, primarily regional and national sports programming companies and a national advertising company, in which Rainbow Media Holdings has varying minority ownership interests. GAIN ON SALE OF PROGRAMMING INTERESTS of $746.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 resulted from the sale of a 20% minority interest in certain national programming businesses.

(61) COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 VERSUS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 RAINBOW MEDIA GROUP REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $123.1 million (34%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. Approximately $56.3 million (16%) of the increase was a direct result of the Transactions, approximately $46.8 million (13%) of the increase was attributable to growth in programming network subscribers and rate increases and approximately $20.0 million (5%) of the increase was attributable to higher advertising and other revenues. TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES increased $41.1 million (28%) for the year ended December 31, 2000 over the same 1999 period. Approximately $36.1 million (25%) of the increase was directly attributable to the Transactions.

The net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decrease in revenue attributable to the Transactions................................. $ (264.7) Increase in revenue from developing cable modem and telephone businesses............. 112.9 Higher revenue per cable television subscriber....................................... 71.9 Decrease in Madison Square Gardens revenue..........................................

(14.8) Decreased revenue in Cablevision NY Groups programming services, excluding Madison Square Garden..................................................................... (7.2) Increase in deferred revenue recognized in connection with warrants previously received from At Home............................................................. 6.9 Other net decreases.................................................................. (10.1) $ (114.1) TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES increased $7.6 million for 2001 compared to 2000. An increase of approximately $100.0 million resulted from increased costs directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers referred to above and an increase of $48.8 million resulted from costs relating to the Knicks player transactions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $111.2 million attributable to the Transactions and a decrease of $30.0 million attributable to a settlement from YankeeNets. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 1% during 2001 as compared to 2000. RETAIL ELECTRONICS COST OF SALES amounted to approximately $563.4 million (83% of retail electronics sales) for 2001 compared to approximately $550.0 million (81% of retail electronics sales) for 2000. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred and certain occupancy and buying costs, for the Companys retail electronics segment. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES decreased $60.1 million (6%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The net decrease for 2001 was comprised of an $88.4 million decrease in charges attributed to Cablevision NY Group related to a stock plan of Cablevision, a decrease of approximately $53.6 million directly attributable to the Transactions, a decrease of $9.9 million in charges attributed to Cablevision NY Group related to a long term incentive plan of Cablevision (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied), and a decrease of approximately $3.4 million due to lower Year 2000 remediation costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately $95.2 million that resulted from higher administrative, sales and marketing and customer service costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan, the long term incentive plan and Year 2000 remediation costs, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 2% during 2001 as compared to 2000. (67) RESTRUCTURING charges of $44.8 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE increased $125.6 million (13%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. Approximately $95.1 million of the net increase was due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets, partially offset by decreases from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Approximately $42.1 million of the net increase resulted from higher impairment charges related to goodwill and capitalized software. (The 2001 amount included a $99.9 million write off of goodwill recorded in connection with the Clearview acquisition. The 2000 amount included a $47.5 million write off of Clearview goodwill and a $10.3 million write off of capitalized software costs.) These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $11.6 million which resulted from the Transactions. NET INTEREST EXPENSE increased $3.1 million (1%) for 2001 compared to 2000. The net increase was attributable primarily to higher average debt balances, partially offset by lower interest rates and higher interest income. EQUITY IN NET LOSS OF AFFILIATES increased to $62.8 million in 2001 from $0.7 million in 2000. Such amounts consist of Cablevision NY Groups share of the net profits and losses of certain businesses in which Cablevision has varying minority ownership interests. The increase resulted primarily from Cablevision NY Groups share of the net losses of Northcoast Communications and R/L DBS, which share amounted to $43.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively, in 2001. Cablevision NY Groups share of the net loss of Northcoast Communications was $2.5 million in 2000. GAIN ON SALE OF CABLE ASSETS, NET for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists primarily of a gain of $1,441.7 million recognized on the disposition of Cablevisions cable television systems in Massachusetts, partly offset by a $12.1 million adjustment to the gain on the disposition of Cablevisions cable television systems in Ohio. For the year ended December 31, 2000, Cablevision NY Group recognized a gain of $1,204.2 million from the disposition of Cablevisions cable television systems in Kalamazoo, Michigan and Ohio. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON INVESTMENTS for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 of $108.5 million and $139.7 million, respectively, represents the charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys At Home warrants. GAIN ON INVESTMENTS, NET for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists of the following: (dollars in millions) Change in the fair value of Charter, Adelphia, AT&T and AT&T Wireless common stock ........ $ (176.6) Gain recognized in connection with the reclassification of the shares of Charter and Adelphia common stock from securities available for sale to trading securities upon the adoption of SFAS 133..................................................................... 286.4 $ 109.8 (68) WRITE OFF OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS of $11.3 million in 2001 and $5.2 million in 2000 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to CSC Holdings credit agreements and the redemption of CSC Holdings senior subordinated notes. GAIN ON DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, NET of $281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists principally of $250.4 million of unrealized gains due to the change in fair value of Cablevision NY Groups prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications shares and $31.4 million due to unrealized and realized gains on its interest rate swap contacts. LOSS ON REDEMPTION OF NOTES of $15.3 million in 2001 consists principally of the premium paid to redeem CSC Holdings $300 million face value 9 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2005 and its $150 million face value 9 7/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006. GAIN ON TERMINATION OF AT HOME AGREEMENT of $25.2 million consists primarily of the recognition of the remaining unamortized deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 relating to warrants previously received from At home. NET MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSE increased to $18.2 million for 2001 compared to $9.3 million for 2000 due primarily to increased losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets. INCOME TAX BENEFIT for 2001 of $39.1 million resulted primarily from a reduction of $203.7 million in the tax valuation allowance exceeding the provision for taxes on the current year income. In 2000, the income tax provision of $42.5 million represented current state and federal taxes resulting from the Transactions. The balance of the 2000 provision was offset by a reduction in the tax valuation allowance of $195.1 million. Cablevision NY Group did not reduce its valuation allowance in excess of these amounts due to uncertainties regarding the realizability of the deferred tax asset. (69) COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 VERSUS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 COMBINED RESULTS CABLEVISION NY GROUP REVENUES for the year ended December 31, 2000 increased $344.7 million (10%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. Approximately $81.5 million (3%) resulted from higher revenue per cable television subscriber; approximately $80.0 million (2%) resulted from increases in revenue from Cablevision NY Groups programming and entertainment services including Madison Square Garden; approximately $78.8 million (2%) resulted from higher retail electronics revenues; approximately $66.8 million (2%) was due to increases in revenue derived from the developing cable modem and telephone businesses and deferred revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home; and approximately $35.3 million (1%) was attributable to internal growth of 65,800 in the average number of cable television subscribers during the year. Other net increases, primarily from advertising on Cablevision NY Groups cable television systems, amounted to $22.9 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $20.6 million attributable to the Transactions. TECHNICAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES for 2000 increased $120.1 million (9%) over the 1999 amount. Approximately $128.6 million (9%) reflected increased costs directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers discussed above, as well as increases in programming costs for cable television services, partially offset by a decrease of $8.5 million attributable to the Transactions. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained relatively constant during 2000 as compared to 1999. RETAIL ELECTRONICS COST OF SALES amounted to approximately $550.0 million (81% of retail electronics sales) for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to approximately $484.8 million (80% of retail electronics sales) for 1999. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred, as well as store occupancy and buying costs for the retail electronics segment. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES decreased $65.1 million (6%) for 2000 as compared to the 1999 level. The change from the prior year resulted from decreases of approximately $151.6 million (14%) reflecting lower charges attributed to Cablevision NY Group related to an incentive and stock plan, approximately $34.4 million (4%) due to lower Year 2000 remediation costs and approximately $12.5 million (1%) directly attributable to the Transactions. Offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately $94.9 million (9%) resulting from higher administrative, sales and marketing and customer service costs and approximately $38.5 million (4%) to expense the unamortized portion of deferred acquisition costs related to Cablevision NY Groups cable modem program. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4% in 2000 compared to 1999. Excluding the effects of the incentive and stock plan and Year 2000 remediation costs, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 2% during 2000 as compared to 1999. OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION increased $224.5 million (34%) to $881.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $656.7 million for the comparable period in 1999. Approximately $151.6 million (23%) of the increase resulted from lower costs related to an incentive and stock plan and approximately $72.9 million (11%) resulted from the (70) combined effect of the revenue and expense changes discussed above. On a pro forma basis, giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 1999 and excluding the Companys systems held for sale, the incentive and stock plan costs referred to above, the charge related to cable modems discussed above, and the costs of Year 2000 remediation, operating profit before depreciation and amortization would have increased 10% in 2000. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization is presented here to provide additional information about Cablevision NY Groups ability to meet future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Operating profit before depreciation and amortization should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for net income (loss) and cash flows as indicators of financial performance and liquidity as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE increased $119.4 million (14%) during 2000 as compared to 1999. Approximately $22.3 million (3%) resulted from higher impairment charges related to goodwill and capitalized software costs. (The 2000 amount included a $47.5 million write off of goodwill which resulted from the Clearview acquisition and $10.3 million from the write off of capitalized software costs. The 1999 amount included a $35.5 million write off of goodwill related to the acquisition of The WIZ stores). Approximately $89.3 million (10%) resulted primarily from depreciation on new plant assets. The remaining $7.8 million (1%) increase was directly attributable to the Transactions. NET INTEREST EXPENSE increased $79.2 million (18%) during 2000 compared to 1999. The net increase is primarily attributable to debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and higher interest rates. EQUITY IN NET LOSS OF AFFILIATES decreased to $0.7 million in 2000 from $11.6 million in 1999. Such amounts consist of Cablevision NY Groups share of the net profits and losses of certain programming businesses and a personal communications services business in which Cablevision has varying minority ownership interests. GAIN ON SALE OF CABLE ASSETS AND PROGRAMMING INTERESTS for the year ended December 31, 2000 represents a gain of $1,204.2 million from the disposition of Cablevision NY Groups cable television systems in Kalamazoo, Michigan and Ohio. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON INVESTMENTS for the year ended December 31, 2000 represents a charge of $139.7 million relating to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the At Home warrants. The 1999 impairment charge of $15.1 million resulted from the write off of an investment held by Rainbow Media Holdings. GAIN ON INVESTMENTS, NET for the year ended December 31, 1999 of $10.9 million resulted from the sale of certain marketable securities. WRITE OFF OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS of $5.2 million in 2000 and $3.0 million in 1999 consists principally of the write off of deferred financing costs in connection with amendments to or termination of CSC Holdings credit agreements. INCOME TAX EXPENSE of $42.5 million in 2000 represented current state and federal taxes resulting from the Transactions. The balance of the 2000 provision was offset by a reduction in the tax (71) valuation allowance of $195.1 million. Cablevision NY Group did not reduce its valuation allowance in excess of this amount due to uncertainties regarding the realizability of the deferred tax asset. In 1999, Cablevision NY Group recorded $6.6 million related to federal, state and local income taxes. In 1999, Cablevision NY Group increased its tax valuation allowance by $205.6 million due to uncertainties regarding the realizability of the deferred tax asset.

(74) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION Cablevision does not have any operations independent of its subsidiaries. In addition, Cablevision has no borrowings and does not have any securities outstanding other than its Cablevision NY Group Class A and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock and the Rainbow Media Group Class A tracking stock and Rainbow Media Group Class B tracking stock. The Company does not intend to pay any dividends on any of its common stock in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, Cablevision does not currently have cash needs independent of the needs of its subsidiaries. Cablevision intends to maintain, wherever possible, separate financial arrangements for the Cablevision NY Group and the Rainbow Media Group. The Cablevision NY Group, which consists primarily of the Companys cable television, telephony, and cable modem operations, its retail electronics and theater operations, and the New York metropolitan area programming and entertainment assets owned by Rainbow Media Holdings but not included as part of Rainbow Media Group, including its interest in Madison Square Garden (referred to as the "Rainbow NY Group"), is currently funded primarily through separate financial arrangements made available to the Companys traditional "Restricted Group" subsidiaries (as defined below), to Madison Square Garden, and to Cablevision Electronics, as described in more detail below. In addition, during 2001 significant funding was provided through the Companys monetization of its shares of stock of AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications and the resulting collateralized indebtedness at certain of CSC Holdings unrestricted subsidiaries (described in more detail later in this section). The Rainbow Media Group is currently funded through cash on hand, a $400 million credit facility made available to Rainbow Media Group, LLC and a $200 million credit facility made available to American Movie Classics and Bravo, as described in more detail later in this section. The following table presents selected historical results of operations and other financial information related to the captioned groups or entities as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001 as attributed to Cablevision NY Group and Rainbow Media Group.

(75) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CABLEVISION NY GROUP Funding for Cablevision NY Groups net cash requirements resulting from its ongoing capital investments, operational needs and debt service requirements is generally provided through separate financial arrangements made available to the Restricted Group, Madison Square Garden and Cablevision Electronics. In addition, during 2001 significant funding was provided through the Companys monetization of its shares of stock of AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications and the resulting collateralized indebtedness at certain of CSC Holdings unrestricted subsidiaries (as described below).

Subsidiaries of the Company holding the cable modem operations which previously had been designated as unrestricted subsidiaries were designated as part of the Restricted Group as of December 31, 2001 and results of these operations will be included in the Restricted Group financial results beginning on January 1, 2002. CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS The Restricted Groups primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations, its bank credit facility and its access to the capital markets as evidenced by its outstanding senior, senior subordinated and redeemable preferred stock issuances. In addition, during 2001, significant liquidity was provided through the Companys stock monetization program. Over the course of the year, the Company monetized and hedged the value of the stock it received in connection with the sale of its Ohio, Massachusetts and Michigan cable systems through the execution of prepaid forward contracts, which consist economically of a loan collateralized by the respective underlying shares of stock and an equity collar that protects the Company from reductions, and allows the Company to benefit from increases, in the respective stock price to a certain level. During 2001, the Companys monetization program generated $1,788.7 million in cash proceeds. More detail on the Companys monetization activities is provided in the section "Obligations Under Derivative Contracts." Currently, the Restricted Group has a $2.4 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures on June 30, 2006, requires no interim commitment reductions, and permits maximum leverage of 6.75 times cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement) through March 31, 2004. As of March 25, 2002, the Restricted Group had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $1,084.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $51.4 million, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $1,264.6 million. The Restricted Groups revolver contains certain covenants that may limit its ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring the Restricted Group to maintain certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. The Restricted Groups plant upgrade, combined with additional amounts required for the start up and operation of new businesses such as digital video services, IP telephony, Lightpaths non Long Island based commercial telephone business, and business modem services create a net funding requirement. In addition, the Company expects that the Restricted Group will fund certain cash requirements of Cablevision Electronics and Rainbow NY Group, certain expenditures relating to the construction and launch by March 2003 of a direct broadcast satellite, for which R/L DBS plans to make additional payments in 2002 totaling approximately $140 million, and certain investments in 2002 totaling approximately $75 million in Northcoast Communications, a wireless personal communications services business in which the Company has a 49.9% voting interest. The Company currently expects that the net funding and investment requirements for 2002 will be met with borrowings under the Restricted Groups existing bank credit facility and that the Restricted Groups available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet such requirements. (77) In 2003, the Company expects that the Restricted Group is likely to continue to have a net funding deficit and will have limited capacity to increase leverage under the existing bank credit facility leverage covenant. In addition, depending on the scope of the Companys pursuit of a direct broadcast satellite business (launch of service is required by December 29, 2003 under the FCC license requirements) and on the amounts of any additional investments in Northcoast Communications, significant additional funding may be required. The Restricted Group has several options with respect to meeting its funding needs. It can reduce capital expenditures or investments; it can pursue asset sales; it can issue equity, debt, convertible debt or preferred stock securities; or it can issue debt securities outside of the Restricted Group, proceeds of which may be contributed to the Restricted Group in the form of equity. In order to issue additional indebtedness at the Restricted Group, the Company would need to either increase its cash flow to reduce its debt to cash flow ratio and increase its resulting debt capacity or amend its existing credit agreement to increase its permitted debt to cash flow covenant. The Restricted Groups future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investor Services and Standard & Poors. Moodys recently downgraded the Companys credit ratings. Standard & Poors has announced that the outlook for the Restricted Groups credit ratings is negative and that its ratings of the Company could be lowered if leverage were to increase above certain levels. Downgrades by either rating agency would further increase the Restricted Groups interest rate on new debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional debt. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS Madison Square Gardens primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and its $500 million revolving credit facility. This facility currently matures on December 31, 2004, has no interim commitment reductions, and permits a maximum leverage of 4.25 times cash flow (as defined in the credit facility) through maturity. As of March 25, 2002, Madison Square Garden had outstanding debt and letters of credit of $235.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively, under this facility, resulting in undrawn funds of $252.5 million. Madison Square Gardens revolver contains certain covenants that may limit its ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring Madison Square Garden to maintain certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. The Company believes that for 2002, internally generated funds and funds available under Madison Square Gardens existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet its projected funding requirement. In 2003, depending on the scope of entertainment projects, potential sports player transactions, levels of capital expenditures and cash flow from operations, Madison Square Garden may need to obtain an amendment to existing financial covenants under its bank credit facility, or, if such amendment could not be obtained, reduce discretionary spending and capital expenditures, and or seek funding from its partners. (78) RETAIL ELECTRONICS CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS Cablevision Electronics primary sources of liquidity have been funds from its bank credit facility and advances from CSC Holdings Restricted Group. Cablevision Electronics currently has a $130 million credit facility, which matures in April 2003. Under the terms of the credit facility, the total amount of borrowing available to Cablevision Electronics is subject to an availability calculation based on a percentage of eligible inventory and compliance with all loan agreement covenants, including a minimum net worth covenant. On March 25, 2002, total outstanding debt under the credit facility was $54.9 million with additional available funds of $8.1 million based on eligible inventory. CSC Holdings cash investment, including intercompany advances, in Cablevision Electronics was approximately $426.9 million at March 25, 2002. Through March 25, 2002, Cablevision Electronics received other financial support from CSC Holdings in the form of guarantees and letters of credit of approximately $40.8 million. The Company believes that Cablevision Electronics will require additional financial support from CSC Holdings in respect of continued operating losses (which are projected to total approximately $35 million in 2002) and capital expenditures during 2002. The Company expects that funds available under Cablevision Electronics credit agreement, together with this additional financial support from CSC Holdings, will be sufficient to meet its funding requirements for the next twelve months. OFF BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Off balance sheet commitments and contingent obligations attributable to Cablevision NY Group as of December 31, 2001 are summarized in the following table: 2002 2003 04 2005 06 Thereafter Total (dollars in thousands) Restricted Group: Letters of credit................. $ 17,473 $ 17,883 $ 19,191 $ $ 54,547 Guarantees........................ 32,289 2,592 1,342 336 36,559 Contractual commitments (1)....... 382,300 947,250 1,329,550 Operating leases (2).............. 42,044 80,329 71,401 144,391 338,165 474,106 1,048,054 91,934 144,727 1,758,821 Other Entities: Letters of credit................. 12,851 2,916 15,767 Guarantees........................

(2) Approximately $14,646 and $8,108 of operating lease commitments for the Restricted Group and Other Entities, respectively, have been accrued at December 31, 2001 in connection with the restructuring announced in December 2001. (3) Approximately $63,014 of commitments relating to certain Knicks player transactions have been accrued at December 31, 2001. Other amounts consist primarily of professional sports teams rights payments and player contracts of MSG. (79) RESTRICTED GROUP The Restricted Groups guarantees outstanding of $36.6 million consists primarily of guarantees of obligations of certain unrestricted subsidiaries included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet, including: (i) guarantees with respect to certain purchase obligations and certain capital leases of Cablevision Electronics; and (ii) guarantees in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations and potential early termination events in connection with the monetization of the Companys holdings of Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications common stock. Amounts payable under such monetization guarantees are estimated as of a particular point in time by the financial institution counterparty and are based upon the current price of the underlying common stock and various other assumptions, including stock market volatility and prevailing interest rates. Such guaranteed amounts approximate the net sum of the monetization indebtedness less the fair value of the underlying stock less the fair value of the equity collar as reflected in the Companys accompanying balance sheet. Contractual commitments attributable to the Restricted Group in the table above represent primarily minimum purchase requirements through 2004 of digital boxes from a manufacturer used in connection with the Companys recently launched iO, Interactive Optimum digital cable service. The Restricted Groups operating lease minimum payments represent primarily future payment commitments resulting from the Companys non cancelable leases of certain office space and rental space on utility poles, through 2006, used in its distribution of services. OTHER CABLEVISION NY GROUP ENTITIES Additional off balance sheet commitments identified in the table above consist primarily of contractual commitments and operating leases. The dollar amounts reflected under the heading contractual commitments consist primarily of the following: (i) long term rights agreements of Madison Square Garden which provide Madison Square Garden with exclusive broadcast rights to certain live sporting events in exchange for minimum contractual payments, (ii) certain payment commitments associated with the construction of a new practice facility by Madison Square Garden, and (iii) commitments under employment agreements with professional sports team personnel of Madison Square Garden, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination. Certain of these payments are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met. In addition, minimum contractual payment commitments of R/L DBS to a satellite manufacturer in connection with the construction and launch of a direct broadcast satellite by March 2003 are included in the table. In addition to the above amounts, Madison Square Garden may also be obligated to pay the National Basketball Association ("NBA") a luxury tax each year pursuant to the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (the "Agreement"), which is in effect through June 30, 2004 and which may be extended for a term of one year by the NBA. The ultimate calculation of any amounts due would be based on a formula established by the Agreement. If the luxury tax is in effect for a given season, to the extent the Knicks salary (as defined) exceeds the luxury tax "trigger," a tax will be due to the NBA. The Company anticipates that a luxury tax will be payable to the NBA for the year ended December 31, 2001. Operating lease commitments represent primarily future minimum payment obligations of (80) Cablevision Electronics and Clearview Cinemas for retail store and theatre rental space, as well as future minimum rental commitments on various long term, noncancelable leases for office and storage space as well as for practice facilities of Madison Square Garden and lease commitments of Radio City Music Hall. OBLIGATIONS UNDER DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS To manage interest rate risk, the Company has from time to time entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and has only entered into transactions with counterparties that are investment grade rated. All of the Companys interest rate derivative contracts are entered into by CSC Holdings and are thus attributable to the Restricted Group; all such contracts are carried at their current fair market values (based on dealer quotes) on the Companys consolidated balance sheet with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2001, the notional value of all such contracts was $980 million and the fair value of these derivative contracts was $17.3 million, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a net gain on interest swap contracts of $28.8 million, as detailed in the table below: FAIR MARKET VALUE OF INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Fair market value as of December 31, 2001............................ $ 17,320 Less: fair market value as of January 1, 2001....................... 1,980 Unrealized gain due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net.. 15,340 Plus: realized gain resulting from cash interest income........... 13,454 Net gain on interest rate swap contracts........................ $ 28,794 The Company has also entered into derivative contracts to hedge its equity price risk and monetize the value of its shares of AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications common stock. These contracts consist primarily of a loan secured by the underlying common stock (reflected as "collateralized indebtedness" on the consolidated balance sheet) and an equity derivative which sets a floor and ceiling on the Companys participation in changes in the underlying stock price, thereby eliminating downside exposure and providing for upside appreciation potential to the contracts ceiling price. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, or AT&T Wireless stock (as the case may be), with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. The terms of the AT&T transactions require cash settlement in an amount determined by reference to the AT&T stock price at maturity. The Company currently intends to generate the cash settlement amount through a sale of the underlying common shares at maturity. (81) These monetization transactions are obligations of wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in the Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and certain other contingent obligations as described above. All of the Companys equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair market value on the Companys consolidated balance sheet (based on dealer quotes) with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys equity derivative contracts was $250.4 million, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a net unrealized gain on the prepaid forward contracts of $250.4 million attributable to changes in market conditions during the period. This gain on derivative contracts was partially offset by a loss on the Companys holdings of the underlying stocks of $176.7 million, as shown in the following table: FAIR MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Fair market value as of December 31, 2001............................ $ 250,376 Less: fair market value at January 1, 2001.......................... Unrealized gain due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net.. $ 250,376 Unrealized loss on underlying stock positions due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net.................................. ($176,673) In connection with the AT&T and AT&T Wireless monetization contracts, CSC Holdings entered into prepaid interest rate swaps with a notional contract value of $1.1 billion. These contracts require CSC Holdings to pay floating rates of interest in exchange for receipt of fixed rate payments, the net present value of which was paid to CSC Holdings at the inception of the transaction in a total cash amount of $239.3 million. Combined, the prepaid equity forward and prepaid interest rate swap transactions generated cash proceeds of approximately $1,788.7 million and such amount was applied towards the repayment of outstanding bank debt under CSC Holdings revolving credit facility. All of the Companys prepaid interest rate swaps are carried at their current fair market values on the Companys consolidated balance sheet (based on dealer quotes) with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys prepaid interest rate derivative contracts was $226.3 million, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded a net gain on such derivative contracts of $2.6 million as detailed below: FAIR MARKET VALUE OF INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Fair market value as of December 31, 2001............................ $ (226,295) Less: fair market value at inception................................

Actual amounts payable under such leases over the five years subsequent to December 31, 2001 and thereafter are as follows: CAPITAL LEASES (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) 2002 $ 7,140 2003 7,140 2004 6,780 2005 2,820 2006 2,820 Thereafter 6,000 Total $ 32,700 CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS Financing for Rainbow Media Group, which consists primarily of the Companys interest in five nationally distributed entertainment programming networks (American Movie Classics, Bravo, The Independent Film Channel, WE: Womens Entertainment (formerly Romance Classics), and MuchMusic), interests in certain regional sports networks, and Sterling Digital, has historically been provided by a combination of cash flow from operations, bank credit facilities, intercompany borrowings, sales of interests in programming entities, and, from time to time, by equity contributions from partners. The Rainbow Media Group is currently funded through cash from operations, a $400 million credit facility made available to Rainbow Media Group, LLC ("RMG LLC") and a $200 million credit facility made available to American Movie Classics and Bravo Company. The RMG LLC credit facility is a $400 million revolving credit facility that was put in place on March 25, 2002 and matures on December 31, 2006 (in certain limited circumstances the maturity date may be accelerated to November 1, 2005). The facility requires commitment reductions beginning in the third quarter of 2004 and permits maximum leverage of 3.5 times cash flow (as defined based on the cash flow of American Movie Classics, Bravo and The Independent Film Channel) through September 30, 2004. As of March 25, 2002, Rainbow Media Group had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $101.5 million, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $298.5 million. The RMG LLC facility contains certain covenants that may limit Rainbow Media Groups ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. Proceeds from the RMG LLC credit facility are not permitted to be invested in the American Movie Classics and or Bravo partnerships. The American Movie Classics/Bravo credit facility is a $200 million revolving credit facility that was put in place on March 25, 2002 and matures on December 31, 2006 (in certain limited circumstances the maturity date may be accelerated to November 1, 2005). The facility requires commitment reductions beginning in the third quarter of 2004 and permits maximum leverage of 2.0 times cash flow (as defined based on the cash flow of American Movie Classics, Bravo and The Independent Film Channel) through maturity. The facility amended and restated the previously existing American Movie Classics $200 million revolving credit facility. As of March 25, 2002, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility. The revolver (83) contains certain covenants that may limit American Movie Classics and Bravos ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring the maintenance of financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. Developmental activities of certain of Rainbow Media Groups businesses, including projected investments in new programming content and services such as the digital video programming services being developed by Sterling Digital, require funding. Such funding may be obtained through cash generated from other Rainbow Media Group operations or through borrowings under the RMG LLC credit facility. The Company believes that it has sufficient funding from these sources to fund these activities for the next twelve months. In addition, the American Movie Classics/Bravo credit facility, together with cash generated by these partnerships, are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to American Movie Classics/Bravo for the next twelve months, as these partnerships currently generate net cash as a whole. Taken as a whole, the Rainbow Media Group businesses are expected to generate net free cash flow. Under the terms of the American Movie Classics/Bravo agreement with MGM, American Movie Classics/Bravo are also required to distribute excess cash flow (as defined in the agreement), if any, to their partners annually. Beginning on December 18, 2002, Fox Sports Networks has the ability under certain circumstances to exercise a right to put its 40% interest in Regional Programming Partners, which includes Rainbow Media Groups regional sports programming businesses as well as other operations attributable to Cablevision NY Group, such as Madison Square Garden, Fox Sports Net New York and Metro Channel, to Rainbow Regional Holdings. This right must be exercised within thirty days and is not exercisable again until December 2005. Upon exercise, Rainbow Media Holdings may elect to either conduct an initial public offering of Regional Programming Partners which eliminates the put or purchase Fox Sports Networks 40% interest. Payment for the interest may be made via issuance of marketable securities of Cablevision (which includes shares of Cablevision NY Group common stock or Rainbow Media Group tracking stock) or Rainbow Media Holdings, or with a three year bullet promissory note bearing interest at Prime plus 0.5% and secured by the Fox Sports Networks interest purchased. Exercise of the put is within Fox Sports Networks discretion and no assurances can be given that it will or will not occur. The Company expects that if this exercise were to occur, the payment obligation would be allocated between the Rainbow Media Group and the Cablevision NY Group in proportion to their respective economic interests in the businesses of Regional Programming Partners. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Off balance sheet commitments and contingent obligations attributable to Rainbow Media Group as of December 31, 2001 are summarized in the following table: 2002 2003 04 2005 06 Thereafter Total (dollars in thousands) Guarantees (1)....................... $ 16,751 $ 48,822 $ 41,099 $ 343,328 $ 450,000 Contractual commitments (2).......... 68,074 111,675 58,385 117,260 355,394 Operating leases (3)................. 8,216 12,781 11,401 13,648 46,046 Total................................ $ 93,041 $ 173,278 $ 110,885 $ 474,236 $ 851,440 (1) Represents primarily guarantees for professional sports teams rights agreements of non consolidated Fox Sports Net affiliates. (2) Represents primarily professional sports teams rights payments of consolidated Fox Sports Net businesses. (3) Approximately $11,670 of operating lease commitments have been accrued at December 31, 2001 in connection with the restructuring announced in December 2001. (84) Guarantees identified in the table above attributable to Rainbow Media Group represent obligations in respect of certain professional sports teams rights agreements entered into by certain non consolidated subsidiaries. The amounts guaranteed represent Rainbow Media Groups proportionate interest in the payment obligation based on its ownership interest in the subsidiary. These guarantees are legal obligations of Rainbow Media Holdings (which is a subsidiary attributed to the Cablevision NY Group) with a back to back reimbursement agreement provided by RMG LLC and have therefore been directly attributed to Rainbow Media Group. Amounts payable under contractual commitments shown above represent primarily future payments due under rights agreements which provide certain Rainbow Media Group companies with the exclusive rights to air certain professional sports team games. Operating lease future payments represent primarily non cancelable leases of office space. Certain lease obligations of Sterling Digital are currently guaranteed by CSC Holdings (which is a subsidiary attributed to the Cablevision NY Group and to the Restricted Group) with a back to back reimbursement agreement provided by RMG LLC and have therefore been directly attributed to Rainbow Media Group. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company holds a 49.9% voting interest and certain preferential distribution rights in Northcoast Communications, a wireless personal communications services ("PCS") provider that holds licenses to provide service in certain markets including Cleveland, New York City and Boston. Northcoast Communications commenced commercial service in Cleveland in April 2001. Northcoast Communications operations are not consolidated with the Company. At December 31, 2001, Northcoast Communications total outstanding debt was $131.0 million which consisted primarily of $68.8 million in notes payable to the FCC for the acquisition of PCS licenses acquired during 1997 and $62.0 million in vendor financing outstanding under a $75 million facility obtained in connection with its launch of commercial service in Cleveland. CSC Holdings has guaranteed the payment of the FCC indebtedness of the Northcoast Communications subsidiary that holds the Cleveland PCS license, which had an outstanding balance of $3.2 million as of December 31, 2001. As of December 31, 2001, the Company, through the Restricted Group, had invested $152.8 million in Northcoast Communications (either directly or through loans to Northcoast PCS, LLC, the other member in Northcoast Communications). The Company anticipates that it will invest up to $75 million in Northcoast Communications during 2002, all of which will be used to fund the buildout of Northcoast Communications PCS licenses in accordance with FCC minimum buildout requirements, FCC debt service and certain operating expenses. To avoid forfeiture of its PCS licenses, Northcoast Communications must certify to the FCC that it has met certain construction benchmarks by April 28, 2002 in certain markets and by June 27, 2002 in other markets, including New York City. The Company also provides certain management services to Northcoast Communications, subject to the direction and control of Northcoast Communications, for which it receives an annual fee plus reimbursement of costs and expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded management fees of $13.6 million which were unpaid as of March 25, 2002. Northcoast Communications is controlled by John Dolan, a nephew of Charles F. Dolan and a cousin of James L. Dolan, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. (85) IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, and Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Statement 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations. Statement 141 also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Statement 142 will require that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142. Statement 142 will also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The Company adopted the provisions of Statement 141 effective July 1, 2001. The adoption of Statement 141 had no effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. Statement 142 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2002. At that time, any goodwill and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination will not be amortized, but will be evaluated for impairment in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142. Statement 141 will require, upon adoption of Statement 142, that the Company evaluate its existing intangible assets and goodwill that were acquired in a prior purchase business combination, and to make any necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in Statement 141 for recognition apart from goodwill. Upon adoption of Statement 142, the Company will be required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations, and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the end of the first interim period after adoption. In addition, to the extent an intangible asset is identified as having an indefinite useful life, the Company will be required to test the intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of Statement 142 within the first interim period. Any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first interim period. The Company will adopt Statement 142 effective January 1, 2002 and is evaluating the effect that such adoption may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position. As a result of adoption, a substantial amount of the Companys intangible assets will no longer be amortized. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which supersedes both Statement 121 and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions (Opinion 30), for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). Statement 144 retains the fundamental provisions in Statement 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with Statement 121. Statement 144 retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present (86) discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). Unlike Statement 121, an impairment assessment under Statement 144 will never result in a write down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under Statement 142. The Company is required to adopt Statement 144 on January 1, 2002. Management does not expect the adoption of Statement 144 for long lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements because the impairment assessment under Statement 144 is largely unchanged from Statement 121. The provisions of Statement 144 generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities. Therefore, management cannot determine the potential effects that adoption of Statement 144 will have on the Companys financial statements. In November 2001, FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF No. 01 09, "Accounting for the Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors Products." EITF No. 01 09 stipulates the criteria to be met in determining the financial statement classification of customer incentives (which includes deferred carriage fees) as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense. As required, effective January 1, 2002, the Company will generally reclassify the amortization of its deferred carriage fees as a reduction to revenues, net. All comparative periods will be restated. The amortization of deferred carriage fees shown on the balance sheet is currently included in technical and operating expenses, which would correspondingly be reduced such that operating income and net income would not be affected. (87) ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and certain equity security prices. The Companys exposure to interest rate movements results from its use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund its working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, the Company has entered into from time to time interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. In addition, the Company from time to time may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Companys exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the AT&T, Adelphia Communications, Charter Communications, and AT&T Wireless common stock held by the Company. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had hedged its equity price risk on all of these shares through the execution of prepaid forward contracts. Such contracts set a floor and ceiling on the Companys participation in changes in the underlying stock price, thereby eliminating downside exposure and providing for upside appreciation potential to the contracts ceiling price. FAIR VALUE OF DEBT: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2001, the fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock of $6,337.8 million exceeded its carrying cost by approximately $178.3 million. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. The Companys floating rate borrowings bear interest at current market rates and thus approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2001 would increase the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock instruments by approximately $299.6 million. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Changes in the fair value of these securities are expected to be offset economically by changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative contracts. INTEREST RATE HEDGE CONTRACTS: As of December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of $980 million. As of December 31, 2001, the fair market value of these interest rate hedge contracts was approximately $17.3 million and are reflected as derivative contracts in the Companys balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2001 prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of all hedge contracts by approximately $13.6 million to $3.7 million. In addition, the Company had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of $1.1 billion entered into in connection with its monetization transactions. As of December 31, 2001, such contracts had a fair market value of $226.3 million, a net liability position reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in the Companys balance sheet. (88) Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2001 prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of these hedge contracts to the Company by approximately $36.7 million to a liability of $263.0 million. EQUITY PRICE RISK: As of December 31, 2001, the fair market value and the carrying value of the Companys holdings of AT&T, Adelphia Communications, Charter Communications, and AT&T Wireless common stock aggregated $1,527.9 million. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $152.8 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are expected to be offset significantly by changes in the fair value of the equity collar used to hedge this market price risk. As of December 31, 2001, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of AT&T, Adelphia Communications, Charter Communications and AT&T Wireless aggregated $250.4 million, a net receivable position. The maturities of these prepaid forward contracts, all of which were entered into 2001, are summarized in the following table: # of Shares Security Deliverable Maturity AT&T 22,130,466 2005 22,130,466 2006 Adelphia 3,000,000 2004 3,000,000 2005 4,800,000 2006 Charter 1,862,229 2005 5,586,687 2006 3,724,460 2007 AT&T Wireless 7,121,583 2005 7,121,583 2006
