CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. 32 The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Restructuring Charges: In 2001, the Company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations. The costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services, and provisions for lease termination costs, including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances. In 2002, the Company announced a new operating plan and restructuring which included the closing of 26 retail electronics store locations, the elimination of certain staff positions, the reduction of capital expenditures and the disposition of its motion picture theater business. Additionally, the Company reached an agreement with its supplier of set top boxes which reduced the Companys purchase commitments for set top boxes from $378.5 million in 2002, $378.5 million in 2003, and $567.8 million in 2004 to a total remaining commitment of $87.5 million in 2002 and nothing thereafter and requires the Company to make certain other cash payments aggregating $50.0 million plus interest on a portion of such amount with respect to, among other things, a license for certain software (valued at $17.5 million based on an independent appraisal). In connection with this plan, the Company recorded restructuring charges, which include employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services costs, and provisions for lease termination costs including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances and other related costs and the cost associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments. Costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis, giving effect to the announced severance plan. Costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals. Actual lease termination costs may differ from these estimates as a result of changes in market conditions. Changes in estimates, as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered, are reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charges, separately reported and identified. Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Companys long lived assets at December 31, 2002 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired of approximately $1.4 billion, approximately $1.2 billion of other intangible assets and approximately 4.6 billion of property, plant and equipment. Such assets accounted for approximately 69% of the Companys consolidated total assets. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangibles the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2002, and then on a periodic basis thereafter. During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $99.9 million and $47.5 million representing the balance of goodwill related to certain theaters of Clearview Cinemas. In 2002, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $43.2 million representing the write down of fixed assets relating to the Companys retail electronics business. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys historical net operating losses. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The Companys ability to realize 33 its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. In 2001 and 2000, the Companys income tax expense reflected reductions in the valuation allowances related to its net deferred tax assets of $410 million and $223 million, respectively. In 2002, the income tax benefit of the Company reflects an increase in the valuation allowance of $59 million. At the end of the second quarter, NBC exchanged part of its interest in Rainbow Media Holdings for shares of Rainbow Media Group common stock. As a result of this exchange, Rainbow Media Holdings became a member of the consolidated federal income tax return of the Company. The exchange was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the valuation allowance was reduced to zero, resulting in a reduction to the recorded goodwill, without any income statement benefit. Plant and Equipment: The direct costs and a portion of certain indirect costs, such as employee benefits, facilities and warehousing, associated with the construction of the Companys cable transmission and distribution system and the provision of new cable service installations, are capitalized. Certain of these costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics. These estimates are evaluated at least semi annually, and any changes that result, which may be significant, are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed. Recent Transactions 2002 Transactions. In December 2002, the Company completed the sale of Rainbow Media Holdings interest in the Bravo programming service to NBC in exchange for NBCs minority interest in Rainbow Media Holdings, increasing the Companys ownership to 100%. In March 2002, Rainbow Media Holdings acquired Loral Space and Communications 50% interest in R/L DBS increasing Rainbow Media Holdings ownership of R/L DBS to 100%. 2001 Transactions. In April 2001, MGM acquired a 20% interest in certain national programming businesses of Rainbow Media Holdings. In January 2001, CSC Holdings completed the sale of its cable systems in Boston and eastern Massachusetts to AT&T in exchange for AT&Ts cable television systems in certain northern New York suburbs and for AT&T common stock and cash. 2000 Transactions. In November 2000, CSC Holdings completed the sale of its cable television systems in the greater Cleveland, Ohio metropolitan area. In October 2000, Rainbow Media Holdings completed the sale of its Bravo Latin America programming business. In September 2000, CSC Holdings completed the sale of its cable television system serving Kalamazoo, Michigan. In August 2000, Sterling Digital was acquired by CSC Holdings from Charles F. Dolan. In August 2000, Rainbow Media Holdings purchased the remaining interests in News 12 New Jersey LLC that it did not already own from the Newark Morning Ledger Co. In May 2000, Rainbow Media Holdings acquired the 50% interest in MuchMusic USA held by Chum Limited, increasing Rainbow Media Holdings ownership to 100%. In January 2000, Regional Programming Partners acquired the 70% interest in SportsChannel Florida Associates held by Front Row Communications, Inc., increasing Regional Programming Partners ownership to 100%. The above transactions completed in 2002, 2001 and 2000 are collectively referred to as the "Transactions." 34  Results of Operations Cablevision Systems Corporation The following table sets forth on a historical basis certain items related to operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated.

Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $124.0 million (3%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Increase in revenue from developing high speed data and telephone businesses $ 154.5 Increased revenue in Rainbow Media Holdings programming services excluding those of Madison Square Garden* 114.1 Decrease in retail electronics sales from continuing operations (77.0 ) Decrease in revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home Corporation (66.9 ) Higher revenue per cable television subscriber 58.6 Decrease in Madison Square Gardens revenue * (51.2 ) Increase in bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications (16.3 ) Other net increases 8.2 $ 124.0 *Amounts exclude the effects of the increase in bad debt expense related to Adelphia Communications. Technical and operating expenses for 2002 increased $5.1 million compared to 2001. The net increase resulted primarily from increased costs directly associated with the growth in revenues referred to above, partially offset by decreased costs at Madison Square Garden (See Madison Square Garden discussion below) and a reduction in management bonuses of $3.3 million. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 1% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Retail electronics cost of sales amounted to approximately $256.5 million (88% of retail electronics sales) for 2002 compared to approximately $306.2 million (83% of retail electronics sales) for 2001. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred and certain occupancy and buying costs, for the Companys retail electronics segment. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily attributable to lower consumer pricing and the liquidation of discontinued, repaired and returned merchandise in the distribution center. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12.9 million (1%) for 2002 as compared to 2001. The net increase for 2002 was comprised of a $17.2 million increase related to a long term incentive plan, a $3.4 million increase in expenses related to the Companys stock plan and a $22.8 million net increase resulting primarily from additional sales and marketing costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $30.5 million due to reductions in management bonuses. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2002 compared to 2001. Excluding the effects of the stock plan and the long term incentive plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs decreased 1% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Restructuring charges amounted to $79.3 million in 2002 and $52.9 million in 2001. The 2002 amount is comprised of a $5.1 million increase relating to the 2001 restructuring and $74.2 million of new provisions relating to the 2002 restructuring. Such charges include expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance, outplacement costs and other related costs, and facility realignment, and the 2002 restructuring also includes $32.5 million associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments. 37 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $100.5 million (10%) for 2002 as compared to 2001. A decrease of approximately $277.7 million resulted from the Companys adoption of Statement 142 as of January 1, 2002 where certain intangible assets are no longer amortized. Partially offsetting this decrease were net increases of approximately $134.0 million due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets and amortization of acquired intangibles and approximately $43.2 million due to the write down of certain fixed assets of the retail electronics segment. Net interest expense decreased $35.9 million (7%) during 2002 compared to 2001. The net decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and an increase in interest income, partly offset by higher overall average debt balances. Equity in net loss of affiliates decreased to $42.7 million in 2002 from $68.0 million in 2001. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company has varying minority ownership interests. Gain on sale of cable assets and programming interests, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists primarily of a gain of $1,441.7 million recognized on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Massachusetts and a gain of $746.3 million from the sale of a 20% minority interest in certain of the Companys programming businesses, partly offset by a $12.1 million adjustment to the gain on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Ohio. Impairment charges on At Home investment of $108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys At Home warrants which reduced the carrying value to zero at December 31, 2001. Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Change in the fair value of Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Comcast, and General Electric common stock $ (884.1 ) $ (176.6 ) Gain recognized in connection with the reclassification of the shares of Charter Communications and Adelphia Communications common stock from securities available for sale to trading securities upon the adoption of SFAS 133 286.4 Loss on various other investments (7.3 ) (.4 ) $ (891.4 ) $ 109.4 Write off of deferred financing costs of $6.9 million in 2002 and $18.8 million in 2001 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, the Companys credit agreements and the redemption of the Companys senior subordinated notes. 38 Gain on derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Unrealized gains due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Comcast, Charter Communications and Adelphia Communications shares $ 551.5 $ 250.4 Realized gains on prepaid forward contracts relating to Adelphia Communications shares 256.6 Unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap contracts 115.9 31.4 $ 924.0 $ 281.8 Loss on extinguishment of debt amounted to $17.2 million in 2002 and $15.3 million in 2001. The 2002 loss resulted from the settlement of the Companys collateralized indebtedness relating to the monetization of its shares of Adelphia Communications common stock. The 2001 loss consists principally of the premium paid to redeem the Companys $300 million face value 91/4% senior subordinated notes due 2005 and its $150 million face value 97/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006. Gain on termination of At Home agreement of $25.2 million in 2001 consists primarily of the recognition of the remaining unamortized deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 relating to warrants previously received from At Home. Minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 include CSC Holdings preferred stock dividend requirements; Fox Sports Networks 40% share of the net income or loss of Regional Programming Partners; MGMs 20% share of the net income or loss of AMC, Bravo (through December 7, 2002), The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment; and NBCs share of the net income or loss of Rainbow Media Holdings through December 7, 2002. Net miscellaneous expense increased to $22.9 million for 2002 compared to $17.3 million for 2001. The increase was due primarily to increased losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $137.8 million in 2002 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $59.2 million. Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations of $225.2 million in 2001 resulted primarily from the Transactions, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance of $410.4 million. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes includes the net operating results of the Bravo programming business which was sold in December 2002 and includes the gain on the Bravo sale of $663.4 million, the operating results of the Companys theater operations business which is classified as held for sale, and the losses relating to 26 retail electronics store locations which were closed in 2002. Business Segments Results Cablevision Systems Corporation The Company classifies its business interests into four segments: Telecommunications Services, consisting principally of its cable television, telephone and high speed data services operations; Rainbow, consisting principally of interests in national and regional cable television programming networks; 39 Madison Square Garden, which owns and operates professional sports teams, regional cable television networks, live productions and entertainment venues; and Retail Electronics, which represents the operations of Cablevision Electronics Investments retail electronics stores. The Company allocates certain costs to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services. The financial information for the segments does not include inter segment eliminations.

These declines were largely attributable to lower revenues at MSG Networks resulting from lower affiliate rates and a decline in advertising revenues, primarily from the absence of the telecast of New York Yankee games which ceased at the conclusion of the 2001 baseball season, as well as the loss of fees associated with the resale of New York Yankee games to broadcast television. In addition, lower revenues reflect fewer events at Madison Square Garden, the absence of Knicks playoff revenues, and the absence of a touring show that ended in 2001. Partially offsetting these declines were higher attendance at Radio City Entertainments Christmas Show presented at cities outside of New York, due primarily to the shows presentation in two additional cities, as well as higher sales resulting from additional events at Radio City Music Hall, an event which took place in part outside the Companys venues in 2002 with no comparable event in 2001, and higher Knicks regular season revenues attributable to ticket price increases and the teams share of higher league wide television revenue. The Companys Christmas Spectacular show at Radio City Music Hall achieved comparable results in 2002 as compared to 2001 despite the cancellation of the January 2002 performances resulting from a decline in New York City tourism following the September 11th tragedy. Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $82.1 million (13%) as compared to 2001. This decline is primarily attributable to lower operating costs at MSG Networks mostly due to the absence of the costs to telecast the New York Yankee games, lower provisions for certain player transactions, a decrease in costs directly associated with the changes in revenue discussed above, lower Knicks team compensation, as well as lower luxury tax. Following the audit of all National Basketball Association (NBA) clubs, the NBA announced that there would be no luxury tax assessment for the 2001/2002 season. Accordingly, a credit was recorded in the second quarter of 2002 reflecting the reversal of prior provisions that had been recorded in anticipation of the tax assessment. 42 These declines were partially offset by the absence of a $30 million credit recorded in 2001 as a result of the settlement of certain litigation with the New York Yankees, LP. Other items partially offsetting the declines were higher Rangers team salaries, as well as higher theatrical development costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $1.4 million (1%) as compared to the 2001 level. This decrease is due primarily to the absence of a provision recorded in 2001 for severance, a decline in legal fees associated with the YankeeNets litigation, as well as an increase in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of a credit related to Cablevisions stock plan. These items were partially offset by an increase in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of the expense related to Cablevisions long term incentive plan, higher professional, marketing and business development fees, as well as other general cost increases. Restructuring charges of $2.8 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs. The charges of $0.5 million in 2002 represent employee severance payments made in excess of accrued balances. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $36.1 million (37%) as compared to 2001 due primarily to lower amortization expense relating to the implementation of Statement 142. Retail Electronics The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys retail electronics segment, Cablevision Electronics. These results exclude the results of the 26 stores closed in 2002 in connection with the 2002 restructuring plan. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 292,969 100 % $ 369,995 100 % Cost of sales 256,487 88 306,187 83 Selling, general and administrative expenses 119,468 41 127,434 34 Restructuring charges 3,021 1 13,720 4 Depreciation and amortization 54,889 19 23,923 6 Operating loss $ (140,896 ) (48 )% $ (101,269 ) (27 )% Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $77.0 million (21%) to approximately $293.0 million, compared to revenues of approximately $370.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2002 was comprised of a $73.6 million decrease in comparable store sales and a net decrease of $3.4 million in other non store sales. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 amounted to approximately $256.5 million (88% of revenues) compared to costs of sales of $306.2 million (83% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. Such costs include the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred as well as certain occupancy and buying costs. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily attributable to lower consumer pricing and the liquidation of discontinued, repaired and returned merchandise in the distribution center. Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to approximately $119.5 million (41% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $127.4 million (34% of revenues) for the year 43 ended December 31, 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of retail store expenses (excluding certain store occupancy costs), salaries and commissions of store personnel, advertising expenses, operation of the distribution center and corporate support functions other than buying. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily attributable to decreased sales volume. Restructuring charges of $3.0 million in 2002 represent adjustments to the estimated costs related to the 2001 restructuring plan. The restructuring charges of $13.7 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to approximately $54.9 million (19% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $23.9 million (6% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001. The net increase in 2002 resulted primarily from impairment losses of $43.2 million relating to fixed assets whose carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value based on discounted future cash flows, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense due to assets becoming fully depreciated in 2001. 44  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2001 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2000. Consolidated Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $45.1 million (1%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decrease in revenue attributable to the Transactions $ (257.4 ) Increase in revenue from developing high speed data and telephone businesses 112.9 Decrease in retail electronics sales from continuing operations (16.6 ) Higher revenue per cable television subscriber 71.9 Increased revenue in Rainbow Media Holdings programming services excluding Madison Square Garden 59.5 Decrease in Madison Square Gardens revenue (34.5 ) Increased revenue attributable to internal growth in the average number of cable television subscribers 25.5 Increase in deferred revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home 6.9 Other net decreases (13.3 ) $ (45.1 ) Technical and operating expenses for 2001 increased $53.3 million (3%) compared to 2000. An increase of $139.8 million resulted from increased costs directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers referred to above and an increase of $48.8 million resulted from costs relating to certain Knicks player transactions at Madison Square Garden. These increases were partially offset by decreases of approximately $105.3 million attributable to the Transactions and a $30.0 million decrease attributable to a settlement from YankeeNets (see discussion below). As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 2% during 2001 as compared to 2000. Retail electronics cost of sales amounted to approximately $306.2 million (83% of retail electronics sales) for 2001 compared to approximately $301.7 million (80% of retail electronics sales) for 2000. Cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred and certain occupancy and buying costs, for the Companys retail electronics segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $56.8 million (5%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The net decrease for 2001 was comprised of a $109.2 million decrease in expenses related to the Companys stock plan, a $10.3 million decrease related to a long term incentive plan (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied), a decrease of approximately $52.3 million attributable to the Transactions and a decrease of approximately $3.5 million due to lower Year 2000 remediation costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately $118.5 million that resulted primarily from additional customer service, sales and marketing and administrative costs. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan, the long term incentive plan and the Year 2000 remediation costs, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 2% during 2001 as compared to 2000. Restructuring charges of $52.9 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of approximately 600 positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $69.9 million (7%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. Approximately $91.4 million of the net increase was due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets, 45 partially offset by decreases from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized, a decrease of $11.2 million which resulted from the Transactions and a decrease of $10.3 million in write offs of capitalized software costs. Net interest expense decreased $34.3 million (6%) during 2001 compared to 2000. The net decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and an increase in interest income, partly offset by higher overall average debt balances. Equity in net loss of affiliates increased to $68.0 million in 2001 from $16.7 million in 2000. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company has varying minority ownership interests. The increase resulted primarily from the Companys share of the net losses of Northcoast Communications and R/L DBS, which share amounted to $43.0 million and $13.9 million, respectively, in 2001. In 2000, the Companys share of the net loss of Northcoast Communications was $2.5 million. Gain on sale of cable assets and programming interests, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists primarily of a gain of $1,441.7 million recognized on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Massachusetts and a gain of $746.3 million from the sale of a 20% minority interest in certain of the Companys programming businesses, partly offset by a $12.1 million adjustment to the gain on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Ohio. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recognized gains of $1,204.2 million from the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Kalamazoo, Michigan and Ohio and $5.7 million from the sale of certain programming assets. Impairment charges on At Home investment of $108.5 million and $139.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, reflect other than temporary declines in the fair value of the Companys At Home warrants. Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 (dollars in millions) Change in the fair value of Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, AT&T and AT&T Wireless common stock $ (176.6 ) $ Gain recognized in connection with the reclassification of the shares of Charter Communications and Adelphia Communications common stock from securities available for sale to trading securities upon the adoption of SFAS 133 286.4 Loss on various other investments (.4 ) (6.7 ) $ 109.4 $ (6.7 ) Write off of deferred financing costs of $18.8 million in 2001 and $5.2 million in 2000 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, the Companys credit agreements and the redemption of the Companys senior subordinated notes. Gain on derivative contracts, net of $281.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists principally of $250.4 million of unrealized gains due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications shares, and $31.4 million due to unrealized and realized gains on its interest rate swap contracts. 46 Loss on extinguishment of debt of $15.3 million in 2001 consists principally of the premium paid to redeem the Companys $300 million face value 91/4% senior subordinated notes due 2005 and its $150 million face value 97/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006. Gain on termination of At Home agreement of $25.2 million consists primarily of the recognition of the remaining unamortized deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 relating to warrants previously received from At Home. Minority interests for the year ended December 31, 2001 include CSC Holdings preferred stock dividend requirements, Fox Sports Networks share of the net loss of Regional Programming Partners, MGMs share of the net income or loss of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment and NBCs share of the net income of Rainbow Media Holdings. For 2000, minority interests include CSC Holdings preferred stock dividend requirements, Fox Sports Networks share of the net income of Regional Programming Partners and NBCs share of the net loss of Rainbow Media Holdings. Net miscellaneous expense increased to $17.3 million for 2001 compared to $9.5 million for 2000. The increase was due primarily to increased losses on the disposal of certain fixed assets. Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations amounted to $225.2 million and $33.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, and resulted primarily from the Transactions, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance of $410.4 million and $223.3 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes includes the net operating results of the Bravo programming business which was sold in December 2002, the losses of the Companys theater operations business which is classified as held for sale and the losses relating to 26 retail electronics store locations which were closed in 2002. Business Segments Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys telecommunications services segment. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 2,275,525 100 % $ 2,328,194 100 % Technical and operating expenses 908,031 40 929,531 40 Selling, general and administrative expenses 450,490 20 508,761 22 Restructuring charges 7,862 Depreciation and amortization 706,237 31 644,485 28 Operating income $ 202,905 9 % $ 245,417 11 % 47 Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $52.7 million (2%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decrease in revenue attributable to the Transactions $ (259.6 ) Increase in revenue from developing high speed data and telephone businesses 112.9 Higher revenue per cable television subscriber 71.9 Increased revenue attributable to internal growth in the average number of cable television subscribers 25.5 Increase in deferred revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home 6.9 Other net decreases (10.3 ) $ (52.7 ) Technical and operating expenses for 2001 decreased $21.5 million (2%) compared to 2000. A $106.1 million decrease attributable to the Transactions was partially offset by increased costs of approximately $84.6 million directly associated with the growth in revenues and subscribers referred to above. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained relatively constant during 2001 as compared to 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $58.3 million (11%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The net decrease for 2001 consisted of decreases of $53.6 million which resulted from the Transactions, $55.4 million attributable to lower expenses relating to a stock plan, and $5.2 million attributable to lower expenses relating to a long term incentive plan (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied), partially offset by increases in various costs aggregating $55.9 million, primarily attributable to the Companys developing high speed data business. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% for 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan and the long term incentive plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 1% during 2001 compared to 2000. Restructuring charges of $7.9 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, and facility realignment. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $61.8 million (10%) for 2001 as compared to 2000. The increase was comprised of a net increase of approximately $73.4 million due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets, partially offset by decreases from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized and a decrease of $11.6 million which resulted from the Transactions. 48 Rainbow The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues for the Companys Rainbow segment. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 554,579 100 % $ 491,783 100 % Technical and operating expenses 290,247 52 232,145 47 Selling, general and administrative expenses 231,929 42 237,530 48 Restructuring charges 11,670 2 Depreciation and amortization 55,004 10 70,832 14 Operating loss $ (34,271 ) (6 )% $ (48,724 ) (10 )% Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $62.8 million (13%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. Approximately $60.9 million of the increase was attributed to growth in programming network subscribers and rate increases, and approximately $3.7 million of the increase was due primarily to the Transactions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million due to lower advertising revenue. Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $58.1 million (25%) compared to 2000. Approximately $44.0 million of the increase resulted from increased costs directly associated with the net increases in revenues discussed above and the remaining $14.1 million increase was directly attributable to the Transactions. As a percentage of revenues, such costs increased 5% during 2001 compared to 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.6 million (2%) for 2001 compared to 2000. The net decrease was comprised of a decrease of $34.7 million in charges related to a stock plan of Cablevision and a decrease of $1.6 million in charges related to a long term incentive plan of Cablevision, partially offset by an increase of approximately $17.3 million resulting from higher sales, marketing, advertising and other general cost increases and an increase of approximately $13.4 million attributable to the Transactions. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% in 2001 compared to 2000. Excluding the effects of the stock plan and the long term incentive plan, as a percentage of revenue, such expenses increased 1% during 2001 as compared to 2000. Restructuring charges of $11.7 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with facility realignment. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $15.8 million (22%) for the year ended December 31, 2001 when compared to 2000 due primarily to certain intangible assets being fully amortized during 2000. 49 Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for Madison Square Garden. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 841,912 100 % $ 876,397 100 % Technical and operating expenses 612,891 73 579,417 66 Selling, general and administrative expenses 143,113 17 140,390 16 Restructuring charges 2,750 Depreciation and amortization 96,259 11 114,537 13 Operating income (loss) $ (13,101 ) (2 )% $ 42,053 5 % Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $34.5 million (4%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. This decline was primarily attributable to lower sales resulting from a change in the mix of events presented at MSGs arena, together with fewer shows at Radio City Music Hall. As a result of a decline in New York City tourism, attendance was also lower at the Companys holiday shows at Radio City Music Hall and the Theater at Madison Square Garden. In addition, revenues were lower as a show tour ended in April 2001. Knicks playoff revenues were lower in 2001 as the team was eliminated in the first round of the NBA playoffs as compared to advancing to the third round in the same period of the prior year and the Rangers revenues were lower in 2001 due to the receipt of National Hockey League expansion revenue in 2000. Partially offsetting these declines were higher revenues for Radio City Entertainments Christmas Show performances outside New York City, as well as higher revenues at MSG Networks primarily resulting from increased affiliate fees, partially offset by a decline in advertising revenues. Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $33.5 million (6%) over the same 2000 period. This increase is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2001 for certain player transactions, higher team compensation, as well as higher contractual rights expense in MSG Networks. Commencing with the 2001/2002 season, Knick player compensation, as well as the provision for certain player transactions, includes a provision for a luxury tax which was expected to be owed to the NBA at the end of the season. Partially offsetting this increase in technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 was a credit of $30.0 million as a result of the settlement of litigation with the YankeeNets. As a result of the settlement, Madison Square Garden received $30.0 million from YankeeNets in 2001 and Madison Square Gardens rights to telecast New York Yankee games ended at the conclusion of the 2001 baseball season. Also offsetting the increase is a decrease in costs directly associated with the changes in revenues discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased $2.7 million (2%) as compared to the 2000 level. This increase is primarily due to a higher provision for severance, increased legal and professional fees associated with the YankeeNets litigation and other general cost increases, partially offset by a $15.8 million decrease in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of expense related to Cablevisions stock plan and a $2.4 million decrease in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of expense related to Cablevisions long term incentive plan (as the criteria for the payout of certain awards were not satisfied). Restructuring charges of $2.8 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs. 50 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $18.3 million (16%) as compared to 2000 due primarily to lower amortization expense as certain intangibles assets have been fully amortized. Retail Electronics The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys retail electronics segment, Cablevision Electronics. These results exclude the results of the 26 stores closed in 2002 in connection with the 2002 restructuring plan. Years Ended December 31, 2001 2000 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 369,995 100 % $ 386,673 100 % Cost of sales 306,187 83 317,330 82 Selling, general and administrative expenses 127,434 34 127,169 33 Restructuring charges 13,720 4 Depreciation and amortization 23,923 6 25,198 7 Operating loss $ (101,269 ) (27 )% $ (83,024 ) (21 )% Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 decreased $16.7 million (4%) to approximately $370.0 million, compared to revenues of approximately $386.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The net decrease for the year ended December 31, 2001 was comprised of a decrease of $23.0 million in cable modem sales no longer being recorded in the retail electronics segment, partially offset by an increase in comparable store sales of $4.9 million and an increase of $1.4 million in revenues primarily from other non store sales. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 amounted to approximately $306.2 million (83% of revenues) compared to costs of sales of $317.3 million (82% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000. Such costs include the cost of merchandise sold, including freight costs incurred as well as certain occupancy and buying costs. The increase in cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily attributable to a $7.9 million write down of inventory as a result of the Companys decision to implement a new merchandising strategy. 51  Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to approximately $127.4 million (34% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2001 and $127.2 million (33% of revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2000.

The decrease in 2001 of $1.3 million resulted primarily from assets becoming fully depreciated during 2000. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $389.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $242.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2002 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from $542.0 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non cash items, partially offset by a net decrease in cash resulting from changes in assets and liabilities of $152.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities amounted to $242.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.

In 2000, the Companys financing activities consisted primarily of $418.6 million of net proceeds from bank debt and $25.6 million from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by other net cash payments aggregating $58.0 million. Discontinued Operations Net cash provided by discontinued operations amounted to $35.9 million, $12.5 million and $25.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. CSC HOLDINGS, INC. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The operations of CSC Holdings are identical to the operations of Cablevision Systems Corporation, except for dividends attributable to the preferred stock of CSC Holdings which have been reported in minority interests in the consolidated financial statements of Cablevision. Refer to Cablevisions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview We have no operations independent of our subsidiaries, no borrowings and no public securities outstanding other than our Cablevision NY Group Class A and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock. Funding for our subsidiaries is generally obtained through separate financial arrangements made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined) and to our Rainbow and Madison Square Garden business segments. The Restricted Group, which consists primarily of our cable television and high speed consumer data operations, as well as our commercial telephone operations on Long Island, is our principal borrower. The Restricted Group has historically raised funds through the issuance of public securities, including senior, subordinated and preferred stock issuances, as well as through borrowings under its bank credit facility. The Restricted Group currently funds the requirements of the Telecommunications Services segment, R/L DBS, and any investments in Northcoast Communications. The Restricted Group may also, from time to time, make other investments as permitted under its credit facility. Rainbow Media Holdings, which comprises the Companys programming operations, is currently funded through cash from operations and, beginning on March 14, 2003 is funded in part through borrowings under a $300 million credit facility made available to Rainbow Media Holdings and a $75 million credit facility made available to AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment. Madison Square Gardens funding requirements are provided through cash from operations as well as borrowings under a $500 million credit facility made available to it. 53 In March 2003, the Company transferred the stock of its subsidiary, Cablevision Electronics Investments to GBO Electronics Acquisition, LLC reflecting the Companys decision to exit the retail electronics business. The following table summarizes our outstanding debt, present value of capital leases and redeemable preferred stock as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of December 31, 2002: Restricted Group Other Entities Total (dollars in thousands) Senior Debt: Restricted Group bank debt $ 1,930,768 $ $ 1,930,768 Rainbow bank debt and capital leases 16,710 16,710 MSG bank debt and capital leases 162,996 162,996 Retail Electronics bank debt and capital leases 21,922 21,922 Other senior debt and capital leases 10,220 51,282 61,502 Senior notes and debentures 3,691,772 3,691,772 Collateralized indebtedness relating to stock monetization 1,234,106 1,234,106 Subordinated notes and debentures 599,128 599,128 Total debt 6,231,888 1,487,016 7,718,904 Redeemable preferred stock of CSC Holdings 1,544,294 1,544,294 Total debt and redeemable preferred stock $ 7,776,182 $ 1,487,016 $ 9,263,198 Interest expense $ 423,339 $ 86,213 $ 509,552 Capital expenditures $ 1,003,588 $ 336,736 $ 1,340,324 Total amounts payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2002 and thereafter, including capital leases and the value deliverable at maturity under monetization contracts, are as follows: Restricted Group Other Entities Total (dollars in thousands) 2003 $ 13,757 $ 33,218 $ 46,975 2004 1,714 167,577 169,291 2005 1,020 650,007 651,027 2006 1,925,000 693,302 2,618,302 2007 934,181 91,487 1,025,668 Thereafter 4,910,113 42,948 4,953,061 Total $ 7,785,785 $ 1,678,539 $ 9,464,324 In 2002, we announced a new operating plan and major restructuring designed to reduce expenses and improve overall liquidity. The plan includes the closing of 26 retail electronics store locations, the reduction of corporate overhead and divisional expense (primarily through the elimination of certain staff positions), the consolidation of customer service call centers and the reduction of capital expenditures, including a significant reduction in required digital set top box commitments, and the disposition of our motion picture theater business. In connection with the 2002 plan, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $84.9 million, $70.9 million of which is directly attributable to the Restricted Group and $10.7 million of which is included in discontinued operations. 54 The following table summarizes the 2002 restructuring charges: Year Ended December 31, 2002 Revisions to 2001 Plan 2002 Plan Total (dollars in thousands) Restricted Group $ 9,486 $ 70,868 $ 80,354 Other Continuing Operations (4,415 ) 3,397 (1,018 ) Total Continuing Operations 5,071 74,265 79,336 Discontinued Operations (2,187 ) 10,672 8,485 $ 2,884 $ 84,937 $ 87,821 Bravo Sale and Related Events In December 2002, Rainbow Media Holdings 80% interest in the Bravo programming service was sold to NBC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company, for $1.0 billion. In consideration for the sale, Rainbow Media Holdings received 12.5 million shares of General Electric common stock and 53.2 million shares of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock (that had been effectively held by NBC on a fully converted basis) were returned to the Company. Upon the closing of the transaction, the previously existing AMC/Bravo and Rainbow Media Group credit facilities terminated by their terms and outstanding borrowings were repaid. In January 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings monetized the value of the General Electric common stock received in the transaction through the execution of prepaid forward contracts, collateralized by an equivalent amount of the underlying General Electric stock. These contracts set a floor and ceiling on the Companys participation in the changes in the underlying stock price and at maturity are expected to offset negative changes in the fair value of the General Electric stock, while allowing for upside appreciation potential to the ceiling price. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of General Electric stock, with a value determined by reference to the stock price at maturity. Cash proceeds of $314 million received in the transactions were distributed to CSC Holdings and were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the Restricted Groups credit facility. These contracts are obligations of certain unrestricted subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings; however, CSC Holdings provided a guarantee of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and any early termination obligations. The amount of the guarantees is capped at $36.1 million in the aggregate. On March 14, 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings entered into a $300 million credit facility and AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment entered into a $75 million credit facility that replaced the previously existing $600 million in combined facilities that were terminated upon the sale of Bravo (see the Rainbow Media Holdings discussion later in this section for further details). Northcoast Communications In December 2002, Northcoast Communications agreed to sell 50 personal communications services ("PCS") licenses and related network assets to Verizon Wireless for $750 million in cash. Cablevision owns a 49.9% interest in Northcoast Communications and expects to receive approximately $635 million in cash upon the closing of the transaction, after repayment of outstanding FCC debt at Northcoast Communications. The sale is subject to FCC and other customary approvals and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2003. We expect to utilize the proceeds of this transaction to reduce outstanding Restricted Group bank debt. 55 Quadrangle Capital Partners Investment On February 5, 2003, Quadrangle Capital Partners, a private investment firm, invested $75 million in a convertible preferred stock security issued by CSC Holdings. The 10% Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock has a 10% dividend requirement payable in additional shares of convertible preferred stock and is convertible into Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock at $13.98 per share. Quadrangle may put the preferred stock to us at any time after August 5, 2003 at the greater of appraised and market value. We may elect to pay the put price, determined as of the date of the put notice from Quadrangle, in cash or in stock at a value equal to 110% of the put price. We also have the right to call the security in certain circumstances. Quadrangle has received registration rights with respect to any Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock received from the Company. In connection with the investment, Quadrangle also has the right to nominate one director to Cablevisions board of directors. In March 2003, Quadrangles nominee was elected to Cablevisions board of directors. Proceeds from the issuance of the security were used to reduce Restricted Group bank debt. Restricted Group As of December 31, 2002, our Restricted Group consisted of: CSC Holdings and all of its subsidiaries holding our cable operations, which encompassed approximately 3 million subscribers; the commercial telephone operations of Lightpath on Long Island, New York; and our consumer high speed data operations, which encompassed approximately 770,100 subscribers as of such date. The Restricted Groups primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations, its bank credit facility and its access to the capital markets as evidenced by its outstanding senior, senior subordinated and redeemable preferred stock issuances and proceeds from asset sales. In addition, in March 2003, the Restricted Group received $200 million in cash from Rainbow Media Holdings. Currently, the Restricted Group has a $2.4 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. The facility matures on June 30, 2006, requires no interim commitment reductions, and permits maximum leverage of 6.75 times cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement) through March 31, 2004. As of March 19, 2003, the Restricted Group had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $1,608 million and outstanding letters of credit of $55.2 million, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $736.8 million. The Restricted Groups revolver contains certain covenants that may limit its ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring the Restricted Group to maintain certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. The Restricted Groups plant upgrade, combined with additional amounts required for the start up and operation of new businesses such as digital video services, Voice Over Internet Protocol service, Lightpaths non Long Island based commercial telephone business, and business high speed data services create a net funding requirement. In addition, we expect that the Restricted Group will fund certain expenditures relating to the construction and launch in 2003 of a direct broadcast satellite, expected to total $80 million in 2003, as well as certain investments in Northcoast Communications until the sale described above is consummated. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements for 2003 will be met with borrowings under the Restricted Groups existing bank credit facility and that the Restricted Groups available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet such requirements. R/L DBS has requested an extension of the launch date of a direct broadcast satellite to August 31, 2003 due to the satellite manufacturers need for additional time for scheduling and testing of the launch vehicle for the satellite. The FCC requires commencement of service offerings by not later than December 29, 2003. We continue to evaluate our strategic and financial alternatives with respect to our investment in R/L DBS. These alternatives could include launch of a nationally or 56 regionally marketed broadcast satellite business. Our liquidity projections do not include the impact of any further investment beyond the projected $80 million investment in 2003. Depending upon the scope of further investment in a satellite business venture, or in any other investment alternative, significant additional funding may be required. Funding for such further investment could come from pending or future asset sales, issuance of new debt or equity securities, or strategic or financial partners. The Restricted Groups future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investor Services and Standard & Poors. Standard and Poors recently reaffirmed the ratings on the Restricted Groups outstanding securities and retained a negative outlook on the Restricted Groups ratings. Moodys recently took our ratings off of credit watch, reaffirmed our bond credit ratings and gave the Companys ratings a stable outlook. Any downgrades by either rating agency would increase the Restricted Groups interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. Rainbow Media Holdings Financing for Rainbow Media Holdings, which currently consists primarily of the Companys interest in four nationally distributed entertainment programming networks (AMC, The Independent Film Channel, WE: Womens Entertainment, and MuchMusic USA), interests in certain regional sports networks, regional news operations, and Mag Rack (Sterling Digital), has historically been provided by a combination of cash flow from operations, bank credit facilities, intercompany borrowings, sales of interests in programming entities, and, from time to time, by equity contributions from partners. Rainbow Media Holdings is currently funded through cash from operations and, beginning on March 14, 2003, is funded in part through a $300 million credit facility made available to Rainbow Media Holdings and a $75 million credit facility made available to AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE. The Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility is a $300 million credit facility consisting of a $160 million revolver and a $140 million term loan maturing March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively. (In certain limited circumstances the maturity date may be accelerated to November 1, 2005). The facility requires commitment reductions beginning in June of 2005 and permits maximum senior leverage of 3.25 times cash flow (as defined, based on the combined cash flows of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE) through March 31, 2005 and maximum total leverage of 5.50 times cash flow through September 30, 2004. As of March 19, 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $274 million, resulting in undrawn commitments of $26 million ($200 million of these proceeds were made available to the Restricted Group through a distribution and, indirectly, through an intercompany advance to Cablevision). The Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility contains certain covenants that may limit Rainbow Media Holdings ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds, and permits investments by Rainbow Media Holdings, subject to certain limitations, in other entities which may include the Restricted Group. The facility also permits distributions to CSC Holdings, subject to certain limitations. Proceeds from the Rainbow Media Holdings facility are not permitted to be invested in AMC, The Independent Film Channel or WE. The combined AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE credit facility is a $75 million credit facility, consisting of a $40 million revolver and a $35 million term loan, maturing March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively. (In certain limited circumstances the maturity date may be accelerated to November 1, 2005). The facility requires commitment reductions beginning in June of 2005 and permits maximum total leverage of 2.0 times cash flow (as defined, based on the combined cash flow of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE) through maturity. As of March 19, 2003, the $35 million term loan was fully drawn with $40 million in undrawn funds available under the revolver. The facility 57 contains certain covenants that may limit AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WEs ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring the maintenance of financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. Currently AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE partnerships generate net free cash flow; however, certain of Rainbow Media Holdings operations, including regional news and the developmental activities of certain of Rainbow Media Holdings businesses, including projected investments in new programming content and services such as the video on demand programming services being developed, including the Mag Rack service, require funding. Such funding may be obtained through cash generated from other Rainbow Media Holdings operations or through borrowings under the Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility. We believe we have sufficient availability from cash from operations and committed credit facilities to fund Rainbow Media Holdings cash requirements through 2003. In January 2003, Fox Sports Networks exercised its right to put its 50% interest in Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area to Regional Programming Partners. Fox Sports Networks put right with respect to its interest in the 40% of Regional Programming Partners that it owns was not exercised and is not exercisable again until December 2005. Rainbow Media Holdings and Fox Sports Networks must determine the fair market value of Fox Sports Networks interest in these two businesses, either through negotiation or through an independent appraisal process. Once the fair market value of Fox Sports Networks interest is determined, Rainbow Media Holdings may elect to either (i) conduct an initial public offering ("IPO") of securities of Fox Sports Net Chicago and or Fox Sports Net Bay Area, or (ii) purchase Fox Sports Networks interest in Fox Sports Net Chicago and or Fox Sport Net Bay Area at the appraised fair market value of such interests. In the event that Rainbow Media Holdings elects to effect the IPO, such IPO must be consummated within 180 days of Fox Sports Networks delivery of the put notice. If Rainbow Media Holdings elects to purchase Fox Sports Networks interests, payment for such interest(s) may be made, at Rainbow Media Holdings election, either (i) with shares of Cablevision common stock, valued at the then current market price (based on a 20 day trailing average), or (ii) with a three year bullet promissory note of Regional Programming Partners bearing interest at Prime plus 1.0% and secured by the Fox Sports Networks interest(s) purchased. In March 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings and Fox Sports Networks agreed on a $110 million purchase price for Fox Sports Networks 50% interest in Fox Sports Net Bay Area and a $40 million purchase price for the 50% interest in Fox Sports Net Chicago, payable in each case in the form of three year promissory notes of Regional Programming Partners, bearing interest at Prime plus 1% and secured by the interests being purchased. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2003 following receipt of customary regulatory approval. Madison Square Garden Madison Square Gardens primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and its $500 million revolving credit facility. This facility matures on December 31, 2004, has no interim commitment reductions, and permits a maximum leverage of 4.25 times cash flow (as defined in the credit facility) through maturity. As of March 19, 2003, Madison Square Garden had outstanding debt and letters of credit of $165.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively, under this facility, resulting in undrawn funds of $324.1 million. Madison Square Garden experiences seasonality in its borrowings due to significant amounts generally received from advance ticket sales in the third quarter. Madison Square Gardens revolver contains certain covenants that may limit its ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder, including covenants requiring Madison Square Garden to maintain certain financial ratios and restricting the permitted use of borrowed funds. 58 We believe that through 2003, internally generated funds and funds available under Madison Square Gardens existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet its projected funding requirements; however, depending on potential sports players and rights transactions, levels of capital expenditures and cash flow from operations, Madison Square Garden may need to obtain an amendment to existing financial covenants under its bank credit facility, or, if such amendment could not be obtained, reduce discretionary spending and capital expenditures, and or seek funding from its partners. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments and contingent obligations not reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2002 are summarized in the following table: 2003 200405 200607 Thereafter Total (dollars in thousands) Restricted Group: Letters of credit $ 26,763 $ 101 $ 35,804 $ $ 62,668 Guarantees 45,471 1,342 1,007 47,820 Contractual commitments 38,484 1,000 39,484 Operating leases (1) 46,548 86,253 78,559 163,429 374,789 157,266 88,696 115,370 163,429 524,761 Other Entities: Letters of credit 5,381 10,000 15,381 Guarantees (2) 16,298 51,017 43,565 339,120 450,000 Contractual commitments (3) 354,720 440,353 303,794 977,171 2,076,038 Operating leases (1) 52,573 99,565 85,277 333,758 571,173 428,972 600,935 432,636 1,650,049 3,112,592 Discontinued operations: Operating leases(1) 19,804 38,029 34,796 112,432 205,061 $ 606,042 $ 727,660 $ 582,802 $ 1,925,910 $ 3,842,414 (1)Approximately $25,666, $6,027 and $9,530 of operating lease commitments for the Restricted Group, other entities and discontinued operations, respectively, have been accrued at December 31, 2002 in connection with the 2001 and 2002 restructuring plans. (2)Represents primarily guarantees for professional sports teams rights agreements of non consolidated Fox Sports Net affiliates. (3)Represents primarily professional sports teams broadcast rights payments and sports teams personnel contracts of MSG. Approximately $65,738 of commitments relating to certain sports teams personnel have been accrued at December 31, 2002. Restricted Group The Restricted Groups guarantees outstanding of $47.8 million consist primarily of guarantees of obligations of certain unrestricted subsidiaries included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet, including: (i) guarantees in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations and potential early termination events in connection with the monetization of the Companys holdings of Charter Communications and Adelphia Communications common stock; and (ii) guarantees with respect to certain purchase obligations and certain capital leases of Cablevision Electronics Investments. Amounts payable under such monetization guarantees are estimated as of a particular point in time by the financial institution counterparty and are based upon the current price 59 of the underlying common stock and various other assumptions, including stock market volatility and prevailing interest rates. Such guaranteed amounts approximate the fair value of the monetization indebtedness less the fair value of the underlying stock less the fair value of the equity collar as reflected in the Companys accompanying balance sheet. The Restricted Groups letters of credit outstanding consist primarily of: (i) letters of credit in favor of insurance providers and certain governmental authorities for the Telecommunications Services segment; and (ii) letters of credit with respect to certain inventory purchases of Cablevision Electronics Investments. Contractual commitments attributable to the Restricted Group in the table above represent primarily minimum purchase requirements incurred in the normal course of its operations. The Restricted Groups minimum operating lease payments represent primarily future payment commitments resulting from the Companys non cancelable leases of certain office space and, through 2006, rental space on utility poles, used in its distribution of services. Other Entities Additional off balance sheet commitments identified in the table above consist primarily of contractual commitments, operating leases and guarantees. The dollar amounts reflected under the heading "Contractual Commitments" consist primarily of the following: (i) long term rights agreements of Madison Square Garden which provide Madison Square Garden with exclusive broadcast rights to certain live sporting events in exchange for minimum contractual payments, (ii) commitments under employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel and players of Madison Square Garden, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination (certain of these payments are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met) and (iii) minimum contractual payment commitments of R/L DBS to a satellite manufacturer in connection with the construction and launch of a direct broadcast satellite in 2003. In addition to the above amounts, Madison Square Garden may also be obligated to pay the National Basketball Association ("NBA") a luxury tax each year pursuant to the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (the "Agreement"), which is in effect through June 30, 2004 and which may be extended for a term of one year by the NBA. The ultimate calculation of any amount due would be based on a formula established by the Agreement. If the luxury tax is in effect for a given season, to the extent the Knicks salary (as defined) exceeds the luxury tax "trigger," a tax will be due to the NBA. The Company anticipates that a luxury tax will be payable in mid 2003 to the NBA for the 2002/2003 season and the Company has made the appropriate provision for the luxury tax for the year ended December 31, 2002. Operating lease commitments represent primarily future minimum payment obligations on various long term, noncancelable leases for office and storage space and lease commitments of Radio City Music Hall. Guarantees identified in the table above represent obligations in respect of certain professional sports teams rights agreements entered into by certain non consolidated subsidiaries. The amounts guaranteed represent Rainbow Media Holdings proportionate interest in the payment obligation based on its ownership interest in the subsidiary. 60  Discontinued Operations Operating lease commitments represent primarily future minimum payment obligations of Cablevision Electronics Investments and Clearview Cinemas for retail store and theatre rental space. Obligations Under Derivative Contracts To manage interest rate risk, the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and has only entered into transactions with counterparties that are investment grade rated. All of the Companys interest rate derivative contracts are entered into by CSC Holdings and are thus attributable to the Restricted Group; all such contracts are carried at their current fair market values (based on dealer quotes) on the Companys consolidated balance sheet, with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2002, the notional value of all such contracts was $1,000.0 million and the fair value of these derivative contracts was $3.5 million, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain on interest swap contracts of $19.9 million, as detailed in the table below: Fair Market Value of Interest Rate Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2002, a net liability position $ (3,525 ) Less: fair market value as of December 31, 2001 17,319 Change in fair market value, net (20,844 ) Plus: realized gain from cash interest income and swap terminations 40,740 Net gain on interest rate swap contracts $ 19,896 The Company has also entered into derivative contracts to hedge its equity price risk and monetize the value of its shares of Comcast, AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Charter Communications, and Adelphia Communications common stock. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset negative changes in the fair value of these securities, while allowing for certain upside appreciation potential. In the event of an early termination of such contracts, however, the Company would be obligated to repay the fair value of the monetization indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and 61 the fair value of the equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The following table details the Companys estimated early termination exposure as of December 31, 2002: AT&T Comcast(1) AT&T Wireless Charter Adelphia Total (dollars in millions) Collateralized indebtedness (carrying value) $ 278.9 $ 449.9 $ 213.6 $ 251.8 $ 39.9 $ 1,234.1 Collateralized indebtedness (fair value estimate) $ 306.3 494.2 $ 231.4 $ 267.9 $ 39.9 $ 1,339.7 Derivative contract 100.7 193.3 157.3 216.3 37.4 705.0 Investment securities pledged as collateral 231.1 337.5 80.5 13.2 662.3 Net (shortfall)/excess 25.5 36.6 6.4 (38.4 ) (2.5 ) 27.6 Value of prepaid swaps with cross termination rights (14.3 ) (24.2 ) (12.8 ) (51.3 ) Net (shortfall)/ excess including prepaid swaps $ 11.2 $ 12.4 $ (6.4 ) $ (38.4 ) $ (2.5 ) $ (23.7 ) (1)Effective with the merger of AT&T Broadband and Comcast, the Companys AT&T monetization contracts were amended to record the transaction as two separate monetization contracts one for AT&T and one for Comcast, on substantially the same terms and conditions. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair market value on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and the monetization indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, or AT&T Wireless stock (as the case may be), with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. The terms of the AT&T and Comcast transactions require cash settlement in an amount determined by reference to the AT&T and Comcast stock price at maturity. The Company currently intends to generate the cash settlement amount through proceeds from the equity collar and or a sale of the underlying common shares at maturity. All of the Companys monetization transactions are obligations of wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in the Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the monetization indebtedness less the fair value of the underlying stock less the fair value of the equity collar. All of the Companys equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair market value on the Companys consolidated balance sheet (based on dealer quotes) with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of the Companys equity derivative contracts was $705.0 million, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded gains of $808.1 million on these contracts, consisting of a realized gain of $256.6 million on the Adelphia Communications contracts which were subject to early termination and a net unrealized gain on all other outstanding prepaid forward contracts of $551.5 million attributable to changes in market conditions during the period. The gains on derivative 62 contracts offset a significant portion of the losses on the Companys holdings of the underlying stocks of $865.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as shown in the following table: Fair Market Value of Equity Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Realized Gains Fair market value of terminated contracts as of May 31, 2002 $ 353,450 Less: fair market value at December 31, 2001 96,874 Realized gain due to early termination, net 256,576 Unrealized Gains Fair market value as of December 31, 2002 705,020 Less: fair market value at December 31, 2001 153,502 Unrealized gain due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net 551,518 Total gain for the period (realized and unrealized) $ 808,094 Unrealized loss on underlying stock positions due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net $ (865,616 ) In 2001, in connection with the AT&T and AT&T Wireless monetization contracts, CSC Holdings entered into prepaid interest rate swaps with a notional contract value of $1,115.0 million. These contracts require CSC Holdings to pay floating rates of interest in exchange for receipt of fixed rate payments, the net present value of which was paid to CSC Holdings at the inception of the transaction in a total cash amount of $239.3 million. These swaps have maturities in 2005 and 2006 that coincide with the related prepaid equity forward maturities. Certain contracts provide for early termination of the prepaid interest rate swap in the event of an early termination of the related prepaid equity forward. All of the Companys prepaid interest rate swaps are carried at their current fair market values on the Companys consolidated balance sheet (based on dealer quotes) with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2002, the fair value of the Companys prepaid interest rate derivative contracts was $102.8 million, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain on such derivative contracts of $96.0 million as detailed below: Fair Market Value of Prepaid Interest Rate Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2002 $ (102,819 ) Less: fair market value at December 31, 2001 (226,295 ) Unrealized gain due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net 123,476 Plus: realized loss resulting from net cash payments (27,429 ) Net gain on prepaid interest rate swap contracts $ 96,047 Related Party Transactions We hold a 49.9% voting interest and certain preferential distribution rights in Northcoast Communications. Northcoast Communications holds licenses to provide wireless PCS in 56 markets, including New York City, Boston, Minneapolis and Cleveland and commenced commercial service in Cleveland (which accounts for approximately 5% of Northcoast Communications total "Points of Presence" or "POPs" covered by its licenses) in April 2001. Northcoast Communications is controlled by John Dolan, a nephew of Charles F. Dolan and a cousin of James L. Dolan, the Companys 63 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. The operations of Northcoast Communications are not consolidated with those of the Company. As of December 31, 2002, Northcoast Communications had $58.2 million in notes payable to the FCC for the acquisition of the PCS licenses acquired during 1997. In addition, a wholly owned subsidiary of Northcoast Communications, Cleveland PCS, LLC, had $68.4 million in vendor financing outstanding under a stand alone $75 million facility obtained in connection with the launch of commercial service in Cleveland. Additional funding for Northcoast Communications has been provided by the Restricted Group, which as of December 31, 2002 amounted to $229.7 million (comprised of contributions directly to Northcoast Communications as well as loans to Northcoast PCS, LLC, the other member in Northcoast Communications, an entity wholly owned by John Dolan), in addition to certain unpaid general and administrative charges from the Company amounting to approximately $5.2 million at December 31, 2002. We also provide certain management services to Northcoast Communications, subject to the direction and control of Northcoast Communications, for which we receive an annual fee plus reimbursement of cost and expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2002, we recorded management fees of $1.8 million, which, together with previous management fees and interest thereon, aggregated $16.9 million and were unpaid as of December 31, 2002. In December 2002, Northcoast Communications agreed to sell 50 PCS licenses and related network assets to Verizon Wireless for $750 million in cash. Cablevision expects to receive approximately $635 million in cash upon closing of the sale, after repayment of outstanding FCC debt at Northcoast Communications. The sale is subject to FCC and other customary approvals and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2003. The Company expects to utilize the proceeds of this transaction to reduce outstanding Restricted Group bank debt. In connection with the Northcoast Communications/Verizon transaction, we entered into an agreement with Northcoast PCS providing that in the event Northcoast PCS does not receive a minimum of $49 million of net cash proceeds upon closing of the transaction in accordance with Northcoast Communications limited liability company agreement, we will pay Northcoast PCS an amount equal to the shortfall between $49 million and the amount it actually receives. This shortfall amount is currently expected to be approximately $5 million. If we pay any shortfall amount to Northcoast PCS and Northcoast PCS then receives any additional cash proceeds as a result of the Northcoast Communications/Verizon transaction, Northcoast PCS has agreed to pay these additional cash proceeds to us until the shortfall amount has been repaid in full. As part of the Northcoast Communications/Verizon transaction, Northcoast Communications agreed to put $60 million of the cash proceeds received from Verizon into an escrow account for one year to be available for any potential indemnification claims. To the extent that payments have not been made out of the escrow account to satisfy indemnification claims, amounts held in the escrow account in excess of $30 million will be released to Northcoast Communications six months after the closing of the transaction. Northcoast Communications has the right to replace the escrow account with a letter of credit in the same amount. As a result of the agreement with Northcoast PCS referred to above, payment of indemnification claims, if any, under the Northcoast Communications/ Verizon agreement for which Northcoast Communications is responsible will be made by the Company. Cleveland Financing Vendor financing for Northcoast Communications Cleveland operation consists of the $75 million credit facility at Cleveland PCS, LLC. This facility has no recourse to us or to Northcoast Communications, other than pursuant to a pledge by Northcoast Communications of the stock of Cleveland PCS and a guarantee of the payment by Northcoast Communications and Cablevision of the FCC indebtedness of the Cleveland PCS subsidiary which holds the Cleveland license which, as of 64 December 31, 2002, had an outstanding balance of $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2002, Cleveland PCS was in default of the terms of this credit facility and had received notice of commitment termination and acceleration from the lender. Northcoast Communications has invested $8.1 million of the $229.7 million invested by Cablevision in Northcoast Communications in Cleveland PCS at December 31, 2002. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This Statement requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred. Under previous guidance, certain exit costs were accrued upon managements commitment to an exit plan. The provisions of this Statement are required to be adopted for all exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Statement 148 amends Statement 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation ("transition provisions"). In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Accounting Principals Board ("APB") Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require pro forma disclosure in interim financial statements by companies that elect to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25 ("disclosure provisions"). The transition methods of Statement 148 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The Company continues to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation. As a result, the transition provisions do not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of Statement 148. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for the Company as of December 31, 2002 and had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. The recognition requirements of FIN 45 are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates. The Companys exposure to interest rate movements results from its use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund its working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, the Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. In addition, from time to time the Company may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Companys exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the Comcast, AT&T, Charter Communications, AT&T Wireless Services, General Electric, and Adelphia Communications common stock held by the Company. The Company has entered into prepaid forward 65 contracts to hedge its equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset negative changes in the fair value of these securities, while allowing for certain upside appreciation potential. In the event of an early termination of such contracts, however, the Company would be obligated to repay the monetization indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair market value on the Companys consolidated balance sheet and the monetization indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2002, the carrying value of the Companys fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock of $6,001.7 million exceeded its fair value of $5,717.2 million by approximately $284.5 million. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. The Companys floating rate borrowings bear interest at current market rates and thus approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2002 would increase the estimated fair value of fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock instruments by approximately $304.2 million. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Derivative Contracts: As of December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of $1,000.0 million. As of December 31, 2002, the fair market value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately $3.5 million, a net liability position, as reflected under derivative contracts in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates from December 31, 2002 prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of these contracts by approximately $8.8 million to a net liability position of $12.3 million. In addition, the Company had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of $1,115.0 million entered into in connection with its monetization transactions. As of December 31, 2002, such contracts had a fair market value of $102.8 million, a net liability position, reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2002 prevailing levels would decrease the fair market value of these contracts by approximately $32.3 million to a liability of $135.1 million. Equity Price Risk: As of December 31, 2002, the fair market value and the carrying value of the Companys holdings of Comcast, AT&T, Charter Communications, AT&T Wireless, General Electric and Adelphia Communications common stock aggregated $972.5 million. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $97.2 million. As of December 31, 2002, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of Comcast, AT&T, Charter Communications, AT&T Wireless and Adelphia Communications aggregated $705.0 million, a net receivable position. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had not hedged its equity price risk in 66 General Electric common stock. The maturities of these prepaid forward contracts, all of which were entered into in 2001, are summarized in the following table: Security # of Shares Deliverable Maturity Comcast 7,159,205 7,159,206 2005 2006 AT&T 4,426,093 4,426,093 2005 2006 Charter Communications 1,862,229 5,586,687 3,724,460 2005 2006 2007 AT&T Wireless 7,121,583 7,121,583 2005 2006 Adelphia Communications 1,010,000 2005
