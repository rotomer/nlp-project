Telecommunications In our Telecommunications segment we derive revenues principally through monthly payments by subscribers to our cable television systems. These monthly payments include charges for cable television, as well as, in many cases, equipment rental, pay per view charges, high speed Internet access and charges for telephone service. Revenue increases are derived from increases in the number of subscribers to our cable television systems, increases in the number and changes in the type of programming and services sold to our existing subscribers, and price increases. We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available to cable television systems. Revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems. By far the most serious challenge we face in our provision of cable television services, which accounted for 50% of our revenues in 2003, comes from competition from the direct broadcast satellite business. There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have. This size allows the DBS providers certain advantages, especially in the pricing they pay for programming. In addition, the cable television operators like the Company must pay local franchises up to 5% of our revenues as a fee for operating in the municipalities we serve. Direct broadcast satellite providers do not pay these fees. The combination of these two factors may lead to retail pricing advantages for the DBS providers. Recent subscriber decreases in the cable business, reversing the historical trend of consistent annual increases in penetration, most likely reflect these pricing advantages, as well as the fact that our penetration rate is now averaging approximately 73% in most areas, which limits our ability to add new subscribers. We intend to counter these advantages by "bundling" our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high speed Internet access and Internet protocol telephone service carried over the cable distribution plant, as well as by providing "on demand" services that are currently unavailable to a DBS subscriber. Our high speed Internet access business, which accounted for 10% of our revenues in 2003, faces competition from DSL providers. These providers have become increasingly aggressive in their pricing strategies in recent years, and customers may decide that a reduced price is more important to them than the superior speed that cable modems provide. Also, the telephone companies may find technological or other solutions to upgrade their service offering, providing additional competition for our service offering. In addition, with 36% of our basic subscribers now subscribing to our high speed Internet service, opportunities to expand that base at the current pace may be limited. The recent gains in cable modem penetration may therefore not be indicative of the results we achieve in the future. Our consumer Voice over Internet Protocol telephone offering, which is in its initial rollout stage, is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited continental long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price. To the extent the incumbents, who have financial resources that exceed those of the Company, decide to meet our pricing or reduce their pricing and features, strategies, future growth and success of this business may be impaired. Lightpath, our commercial telephone and broadband business, operates in the most competitive business telecommunication market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunication companies both incumbent local exchange companies, other competitive local 42 exchange companies and long distance companies. To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of the Company may be impaired. Business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless, data medium. Should the pace of this shift accelerate dramatically, future growth of the Company may be impaired. Rainbow In our Rainbow segment, which accounted for 18% of our 2003 revenues, we earn revenues in two principal ways. First, we receive payments from operators of cable television systems and satellite services. These revenues are earned under multi year affiliation agreements with those companies. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks. The second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising. Under our agreements with cable and satellite operators we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programs. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees. This is because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis, not under long term contracts. Also our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming which is tracked by rating services. We seek to grow our revenues in the Rainbow segment by increasing the number of cable systems and satellite providers that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable systems and satellite services that receive our programming. We refer to this as our "penetration." AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than newer, less penetrated services. Cable operators and satellite providers are increasingly interested in obtaining financial payments in return for carrying new services. These payments take the form of marketing support or direct payments for carriage. We seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing but, ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues are directly related to the penetration of our services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services. The principal goals for us in this segment are to increase the penetration of our national services and our advertising revenues. To do this we must continue to contract for and produce high quality, attractive programming. Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television operators and satellite providers. This increased concentration increases the power of those operators and providers and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration. In addition, this concentration gives those operators and providers greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements. Moreover, as a result of this concentration the impact from a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships becomes more severe. In December 2003, Regional Programming Partners completed the acquisition of the 50% interests in Fox Sports Net Bay Area and Fox Sports Net Chicago that it did not already own in a transaction that was accounted for as a purchase. As a result, as of December 18, 2003, we have begun to consolidate the results of Fox Sports Net Bay Area and Fox Sports Net Chicago. The consolidation will increase the revenues and expenses in our Rainbow segment, although the amount of revenues that the Rainbow segment will receive from Fox Sports Net Chicago are likely to decline in later periods as a result of the loss of the professional sports team rights in the Chicago area. Madison Square Garden Madison Square Garden, which accounted for 18% of our 2003 revenues, consists of professional sports teams (principally the New York Knicks of the NBA and the New York Rangers of the NHL), the MSG Network sports programming business, and an entertainment business, which operates the Madison Square Garden arena, Radio City Music Hall, the Hartford Civic Center and Rentschler Field, faces competitive challenges unique to these activities. We derive revenues in this segment primarily from the sale of tickets, including luxury box rentals, to sporting and entertainment events and from rental rights fees paid to this segment by promoters that present events at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at the entertainment venues, from food, beverage and merchandise sales at the venues and from the licensing of our 43 trademarks. MSG Network derives its revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television and satellite providers, sales of advertising, and from rights fees paid to this segment by broadcasters (TV and radio) and programming services that telecast events of sports teams which are under contract with MSG Network. MSG Network carries Knicks and Ranger games, so that, like the rest of this segment, its performance is related to the performance of the teams. All of these revenues are ultimately dependent upon the quality of our sporting and entertainment events. Our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales, paid attendance, luxury box rentals, and food and merchandise sales. To a large extent, the ability of the team to build excitement among fans and therefore produce higher revenue streams, depends on the teams winning performance, which generates regular season and playoff attendance, and which supports increases in prices charged for tickets, luxury box rentals, and advertising placement. Each of the teams success is dependent on the Companys ability to acquire highly competitive players. Although players are most often highly compensated, future successful performance is not certain. The governing bodies of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL) have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective sports, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing MSGs results of operations. Our sports programming business success is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of a variety of professional sports teams in addition to our proprietary programs. The success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising. Our entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our Radio City Christmas Spectacular and our touring Christmas shows, as well as availability of, and our venues ability to attract, concerts, family shows and events. Rainbow DBS Rainbow DBS launched its VOOMSM service on October 15, 2003. It has not yet produced any revenues. As described under "Rainbow DBS" under "Item 1. Business," through February 29, 2004 this business had 1,627 activated customers. All of these accounts are part of a free preview service period which, in most cases, is scheduled to end on March 31, 2004. The principal challenge for this business is to attract a sufficient subscriber base to reach and exceed a break even point and to do so with subscriber acquisition and other costs that are within its funding capabilities. There can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Restructuring Charges: In 2001, the Company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations. The costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services, and provisions for lease termination costs, including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances. In 2002, the Company announced a new operating plan and restructuring which included the closing of 26 retail electronics store locations, the elimination of certain staff positions, the reduction of capital expenditures and the disposition of its motion picture theater business. Additionally, in 44 connection with the new operating plan, the Company reached an agreement with its supplier of set top boxes which reduced the Companys purchase commitments for set top boxes from $378.5 million in 2002, $378.5 million in 2003, and $567.8 million in 2004 to a total remaining commitment of $87.5 million in 2002 and nothing thereafter and required the Company to make certain other cash payments aggregating $50.0 million plus interest on a portion of such amount with respect to, among other things, a license for certain software (valued at $17.5 million based on an independent appraisal). In connection with this plan, the Company recorded restructuring charges, which included employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services costs, and provisions for lease termination costs including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances and other related costs and the cost associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments. In 2003, the Company eliminated certain staff positions primarily at Madison Square Garden and in the Telecommunications segment and incurred severance costs aggregating approximately $6.1 million. Costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis, giving effect to the announced severance plan. Costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals. Actual lease termination costs may differ from these estimates as a result of changes in market conditions. Because these costs are based on estimates and projections, they can prove to be inaccurate. Changes in estimates, as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered, are reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charges, separately reported and identified. Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets: The Companys long lived assets at December 31, 2003 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") of approximately $1.5 billion, approximately $1.5 billion of other intangible assets and approximately $4.6 billion of property, plant and equipment. Such assets accounted for approximately 68% of the Companys consolidated total assets. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2002, and then on a periodic basis thereafter. Statement 142 requires that goodwill impairment be determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For other long lived assets, including intangibles that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. 45  In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other intangibles the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $99.9 million representing the balance of goodwill related to certain theaters of Clearview Cinemas. In 2002, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $43.2 million representing the write down of software and leasehold improvements relating to the Companys retail electronics business reported in discontinued operations. In December 2003, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $17.9 million, included in technical and operating expense, representing the write off of certain film and programming contracts of the Companys Rainbow segment. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys historical net operating losses. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. The Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. In 2001, the Companys income tax expense reflected a reduction in the valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax assets of $399.1 million. In 2002, the income tax benefit of the Company reflects an increase in the valuation allowance of $58.6 million. At the end of the second quarter of 2002, NBC exchanged part of its interest in Rainbow Media Holdings for shares of the Companys common stock. As a result of this exchange, Rainbow Media Holdings became a member of the consolidated federal income tax return of the Company. The exchange was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the valuation allowance was reduced to zero, resulting in a reduction to the recorded goodwill, without any income statement benefit. In 2003, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $28.0 million relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards. Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Companys cable television system, including line extensions to, and rebuild of, the Companys hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and costs incurred in the construction of the Companys head end facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, sub contractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. Infrastructure costs are depreciated over the 12 year estimated life of the plant, and head end facilities are depreciated over the estimated life of the specific component, ranging from 4 years for certain electronics to 15 years for tower sites. Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance and call completion fees, are expensed as incurred. In addition, the costs of connecting businesses or residences that have never before been connected to the service offering are capitalized. These costs include material, subcontractor and internal labor and related costs as discussed above. In addition, on site and remote technical assistance 47 during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. New connections are amortized over 5 years or 12 years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home, respectively. The portion of departmental costs related to reconnection, programming service up and down grade, repair and maintenance, and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred. Certain of these capitalized costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics. These estimates are evaluated at least semi annually, and any changes that result, which may be significant, are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed. Certain Transactions The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2003 Transactions. In March 2003, the Company transferred the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cablevision Electronics Investments, Inc. to GBO Electronics Acquisition, LLC. In May 2003, Northcoast Communications, an unconsolidated subsidiary of CSC Holdings, completed its sale of PCS licenses to Verizon Wireless for approximately $763.0 million in cash. Of the proceeds, approximately $51.0 million was used by Northcoast Communications to retire debt. The remaining proceeds, after payment of expenses, were distributed to the partners of Northcoast Communications, including the Company. In July 2003, the Company repurchased MGMs 20% interest in each of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment. In December 2003, Regional Programming Partners acquired Fox Sports Networks 50% interest in each of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area pursuant to Fox Sports Networks exercise of its contractual put right. 2002 Transactions.

Technical and operating expenses for 2003 increased $202.7 million (12%) compared to 2002. The net increase is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Increase in network management and field service costs $ 59.0 Increase in Rainbow and MSG programming and production costs, including contractual rights 56.5 Increase in programming costs, including YES Network programming and indemnification costs of $38.4 million 57.1 Costs incurred in connection with the launch of our direct broadcast satellite service 39.8 Increase in technical management and employee bonuses 3.2 Other net decreases (12.9 ) $ 202.7 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 1% during 2003 as compared to 2002 Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, costs of facilities and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and 50 administrative expenses increased $217.3 million (23%) for 2003 as compared to 2002. The net increase is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Increase in stock plan expenses primarily attributable to an increase in the market price of the Companys stock $ 84.3 Costs incurred in connection with the launch of our direct broadcast satellite service 39.0 Increase in sales and marketing costs 23.2 Increase in customer service costs 22.6 Reinstatement of management and employee bonuses in certain divisions 33.8 Decrease in general and administrative cost (17.8 ) Costs associated with the investigation into improper expense recognition 13.3 Higher expenses relating to a long term incentive plan, as described in Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements 12.5 Legal expenses relating to the YES Network dispute 6.4 $ 217.3 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3% in 2003 compared to 2002. Excluding the effects of the stock plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 1% during 2003 as compared to 2002. Other operating income of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the sale of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications for which a reserve had previously been recorded. Restructuring charges amounted to $10.7 million in 2003 and $74.1 million in 2002. The 2003 amount is comprised of $4.6 million in facility realignment costs relating to the 2001 restructuring, and $6.1 million of new provisions associated with the elimination of positions, including severance, outplacement costs and other related costs relating to the 2003 restructuring. The 2002 amount is comprised of a $1.1 million increase relating to the 2001 restructuring and $73.0 million of new provisions relating to the 2002 restructuring. Such charges include expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance, outplacement costs and other related costs, and facility realignment. The 2002 restructuring also includes the $32.5 million portion of a settlement with a vendor attributed to a reduction in required digital set top box commitments. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $187.0 million (21%) for 2003 as compared to 2002. The increases resulted primarily from depreciation of new subscriber devices, headend upgrades and new plant assets, the write off of certain fixed assets, costs of disposal of certain fixed assets and amortization of acquired intangibles. Net interest expense increased $119.1 million (25%) during 2003 compared to 2002. Approximately $87.3 million of the increase for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the classification of dividends on CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock as interest expense in connection with the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 as of July 1, 2003 and the inclusion of such dividends for the six months ended December 31, 2003 in interest expense. The remaining increase of $31.8 million was primarily attributable to higher overall average debt balances, partly offset by lower average interest rates (weighted average of 6.3% in 2003 as compared to 6.6% in 2002) and lower interest income ($12.5 million in 2003 as compared to $22.4 million in 2002.) Equity in net income of affiliates amounted to $429.7 million in 2003 compared to equity in net loss of affiliates of $42.4 million in 2002. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company has varying minority ownership interests. The 51 amount for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes $434.6 million representing our equity in the net income of Northcoast Communications, LLC, which resulted primarily from the gain related to Northcoast Communications sale of its personal communication service licenses to Verizon Wireless. Loss on sale of cable assets of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the contemplated settlement of working capital adjustments associated with the Companys sale of cable systems to AT&T in 2001.

Write off of deferred financing costs of $0.4 million in 2003 and $6.9 million in 2002 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, the Companys credit agreements and the redemption of the Companys senior subordinated notes. Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Unrealized gain (loss) due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog and Adelphia Communications shares $ (180.1 ) $ 551.5 Realized gain on prepaid forward contracts relating to Adelphia Communications shares 256.6 Unrealized gain (loss) on exchange right and put option related to CSC Holdings Series A Preferred Stock (38.6 ) Unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap contracts 10.4 115.9 $ (208.3 ) $ 924.0 Loss on extinguishment of debt amounted to $17.2 million in 2002.

Net miscellaneous income of $3.6 million for 2003 resulted primarily from dividends received on certain of the Companys investment securities. The 2002 expense of $5.7 million includes various miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by dividends on certain of the Companys investment securities. Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations of $20.4 million in 2003 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, offset by an increase in the valuation allowance (see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) of $28.0 million, non deductible preferred stock dividends, a non deductible adjustment related to the exchange right and put option related to the Series A Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings, state taxes, and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate. The income tax benefit of $74.4 million in 2002 resulted from a pretax loss, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $58.6 million, non deductible preferred stock dividends and state taxes.

Approximately $45.0 million of the increase was attributed to growth in programming network subscribers and rate increases, approximately $51.3 million of the increase was due primarily to higher advertising revenue and a $15.3 million positive variance resulting from a decrease in bad debt expense recognized in 2002 in connection with the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications. Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $24.4 million (8%) compared to 2002. An increase of $17.9 million resulted from the write down of certain film and programming contracts.

As a percentage of revenues, such costs decreased 3% during 2003 as compared to 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $45.2 million (18%) for 2003 compared to 2002. The net increase was comprised of an increase of $22.2 million in charges related to an employee stock plan, $14.7 million resulting from higher sales, marketing, advertising and other general and administrative cost increases and a $12.4 million increase resulting from costs associated with the investigation, partially offset by a decrease of $4.1 million in charges related to a long term incentive plan. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2003 as compared to 2002. Excluding the effects of the stock plan, such expenses decreased 3% as a percentage of revenue during 2003 as compared to 2002.

See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the restatement of the 2002 and 2001 financial statements. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 771,986 100 % $ 789,677 100 % Technical and operating expenses 567,870 74 530,787 67 Selling, general and administrative expenses 144,106 19 141,473 18 Other operating income (497 ) Restructuring charges 3,735 550 Depreciation and amortization 52,273 7 60,167 8 Operating income (loss) $ 4,499 1 % $ 56,700 7 % Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2003 declined $17.7 million (2%), as compared to revenues for the prior year. This net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decreases from: Lower MSG Networks revenues due mostly to lower affiliate fees and advertising revenues $ (22.4 ) Corporate event in 2002 with no comparable event in 2003 (6.4 ) Fewer events at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall (4.6 ) Lower Knicks regular season revenues mostly attributable to the teams share of lower league wide television revenue (4.0 ) Other net decreases (1.7 ) Increases from: Higher level of concerts and attractions held outside the Companys venues 10.2 Award show which took place in the MSG Arena in 2003 with no comparable event in 2002 5.1 Christmas Spectacular show at Radio City Music Hall, primarily increased attendance 6.1 $ (17.7 ) Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $37.1 million (7%) as compared to the prior year. These expenses were unfavorably impacted by an increase of $15.6 million due to adjustments made to luxury tax accruals payable to the National Basketball Association ("NBA"). In 2002, MSG recorded a credit reflecting the reversal of provisions recorded in prior periods for luxury tax expense as the NBA announced that there would be no luxury tax assessment for the 2001/2002 season. In 2003, MSG recorded a credit reflecting the reversal of a luxury tax provision attributable to a certain player who was previously waived due to a career ending injury. The remaining net increase is attributable to an increase in costs associated with events held outside the Companys venues of $9.8 million, higher provisions for luxury tax relating to the Knicks active roster of $9.4 million, higher team compensation of $8.8 million, an increase in costs associated with 57 the award show which took place in the Arena at Madison Square Garden in 2003 of $5.3 million. These increases were partially offset by $11.8 million primarily due to the absence of the costs for the corporate event discussed above and fewer events at MSG and Radio City Music Hall, as well as lower provisions for certain player transactions, including luxury tax associated with season or career ending Knicks player injuries. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.6 million (2%) as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $12.2 million increase in charges related to an employee stock plan and a $7.7 million provision recorded for severance in 2003. These increases were substantially offset by a decrease in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of expense related to Cablevisions long term incentive plan, lower provisions for bonuses and sales commissions, as well as other cost savings across Madison Square Garden, aggregating $17.3 million. Other operating income of $0.5 million in 2003 resulted from the sale of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications for which a reserve had been previously recorded. Restructuring charges of $3.7 million in 2003 primarily represent severance costs associated with the elimination of certain staff positions. Restructuring charges of $0.5 million in 2002 represent an additional charge recorded as a result of the final cost determination for benefits associated with the elimination of certain staff positions in 2001. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $7.9 million (13%) as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower amortization expense resulting from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. 58  Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2002 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2001. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $206.8 million (6%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Increase in revenue from high speed data services $ 129.5 Increased revenue in Rainbow Media Holdings programming services excluding those of Madison Square Garden* 113.7 Decrease in revenue recognized in connection with the warrants previously received from At Home Corporation (66.9 ) Higher revenue per cable television subscriber 58.6 Increased revenue from developing telephone businesses 25.0 Decrease in Madison Square Gardens revenue* (51.2 ) Increase in bad debt expense associated with the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications (16.3 ) Other net increases 14.4 $ 206.8 *Amounts exclude the effects of the increase in bad debt expense related to Adelphia Communications. Technical and operating expenses for 2002 increased $22.0 million (1%) compared to 2001. The increase is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Increase in programming costs $ 39.3 Increase in interconnection, call completion and circuit fees 23.1 Increase in network management and field service costs 3.3 Decrease in programming and production costs, primarily at MSG, including contractual rights (64.8 ) Decrease in technical management and employee bonuses (3.3 ) Other net increases 24.4 $ 22.0 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 1% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $7.6 million (1%) for 2002 as compared to 2001. The net decrease for 2002 was comprised of approximately $30.1 million due to reductions in management bonuses and a decrease of $18.0 million primarily in lower marketing costs. These decreases were partially offset by a $19.9 million net increase primarily from higher customer service costs, a $17.2 million increase related to a long term incentive plan, and a $3.4 million increase in expenses related to the Companys employee stock plan. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% in 2002 compared to 2001. Restructuring charges amounted to $74.1 million in 2002 and $42.7 million in 2001. The 2002 amount is comprised of a $1.1 million increase relating to the 2001 restructuring and $73.0 million of new provisions relating to the 2002 restructuring. Such charges include expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance, outplacement costs and other related costs, and facility realignment, and the 2002 restructuring also includes the $32.5 million portion of a settlement with a vendor attributed to a reduction in required digital set top box commitments. 59 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $241.8 million (22%) for 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease was comprised of a decrease of approximately $277.7 million resulting from the Companys adoption of Statement 142 as of January 1, 2002 where certain intangible assets are no longer amortized and a $99.9 million decrease due to the write off, in 2001, of excess costs over the fair value of net assets acquired related to Clearview Cinemas. Partially offsetting these decreases was a net increase of approximately $135.8 million due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets and amortization of acquired intangibles and higher losses on disposal of fixed assets. Net interest expense decreased $33.8 million (7%) during 2002 compared to 2001. The net decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rates (weighted average of 6.6% in 2002 as compared to 7.8% in 2001) and an increase in interest income ($22.4 million in 2002 as compared to $17.5 million in 2001), partly offset by higher overall average debt balances. Equity in net loss of affiliates decreased to $42.4 million in 2002 from $68.2 million in 2001. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company has varying minority ownership interests. The decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of Rainbow DBS in March 2002 and decreased losses of Northcoast Communications. Gain on sale of cable assets and programming interests, net for the year ended December 31, 2001 consists primarily of a gain of $1,441.7 million recognized on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Massachusetts and a gain of $745.1 million from the sale of a 20% minority interest in certain of the Companys programming businesses, partly offset by a $12.1 million adjustment to the gain on the disposition of the Companys cable television systems in Ohio. Impairment charges on At Home investment of $108.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 reflects an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the Companys At Home warrants which reduced the carrying value to zero at December 31, 2001. Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Change in the fair value of Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Comcast, General Electric, and Leapfrog common stock $ (874.1 ) $ (176.6 ) Gain recognized in connection with the reclassification of the shares of Charter Communications and Adelphia Communications common stock from securities available for sale to trading securities upon the adoption of Statement 133 286.4 Loss on various other investments (7.3 ) (.4 ) $ (881.4 ) $ 109.4 The effects of these gains and losses are largely offset by the losses and gains on related derivative contracts described below. Write off of deferred financing costs of $6.9 million in 2002 and $18.8 million in 2001 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, the Companys credit agreements and the redemption of the Companys senior subordinated notes. 60 Gain on derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Unrealized gains due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Comcast, Charter Communications and Adelphia Communications shares $ 551.5 $ 250.4 Realized gains on prepaid forward contracts relating to Adelphia Communications shares 256.6 Unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap contracts 115.9 31.4 $ 924.0 $ 281.8 Loss on extinguishment of debt amounted to $17.2 million in 2002 and $15.3 million in 2001. The 2002 loss resulted from the settlement of the Companys collateralized indebtedness relating to the monetization of its shares of Adelphia Communications common stock under prepaid forward contracts. The 2001 loss consists principally of the premium paid to redeem the Companys $300 million face value 91/4% senior subordinated notes due 2005 and its $150 million face value 97/8% senior subordinated notes due 2006. Gain on termination of At Home agreement of $25.2 million in 2001 consists primarily of the recognition of the remaining unamortized deferred revenue at December 31, 2001 relating to warrants previously received from At Home. Minority interests represent other parties shares of the net income (losses) of entities which are not entirely owned by us but which are consolidated in our financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 minority interests consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Fox Sports Networks 40% share of the net income or loss of Regional Programming Partners $ (29.7 ) $ 12.3 MGMs 20% share of the net income or loss of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment (18.2 ) (14.0 ) CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Preferred Stock dividend requirements (174.5 ) (174.5 ) NBCs share of the net income or loss of Rainbow Media Holdings through December 7, 2002 2.9 (195.5 ) Other (1.1 ) (1.0 ) $ (220.6 ) $ (372.7 ) Net miscellaneous expense decreased to $5.7 million for 2002 compared to $8.9 million for 2001. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in certain taxes. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $74.4 million in 2002 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $58.6 million. Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations of $225.6 million in 2001 resulted primarily from the pretax income, including the gains on the sale of the Companys cable television systems in 61 Massachusetts and of a 20% interest in certain of the national programming businesses of Rainbow Media Holdings, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance of $399.1 million. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 reflects the following items associated with assets held for sale: Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 (dollars in millions) Net operating results of Bravo programming service sold in December 2002 $ 14.5 $ 12.5 Gain on sale of Bravo programming service 663.4 Net operating results of the retail electronics business (115.2 ) (74.3 ) $ 562.7 $ (61.8 ) Business Segments Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys telecommunications services segment.

Partially offsetting this decrease were net increases of approximately $137.4 million due primarily to depreciation of new plant assets and higher costs of disposal of certain fixed assets. 63  Rainbow The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues for the Companys Rainbow segment. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the restatement of the 2002 and 2001 financial statements. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 653,259 100 % $ 554,819 100 % Technical and operating expenses 309,907 47 286,443 52 Selling, general and administrative expenses 256,164 39 233,683 42 Restructuring charges (credits) (4,478 ) (1 ) 11,670 2 Depreciation and amortization 70,417 11 55,151 10 Operating income (loss) $ 21,249 3 % $ (32,128 ) (6 )% Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $98.4 million (18%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. Approximately $83.0 million of the increase was attributed to growth in programming network subscribers and rate increases and approximately $30.7 million of the increase was due primarily to higher advertising revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $15.3 million resulting from bad debt expense recognized in connection with the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications. Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased $23.5 million (8%) compared to 2001. These increased costs resulted from higher contractual rights and programming costs. As a percentage of revenues, such costs decreased 5% during 2002 as compared to 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $22.5 million (10%) for 2002 compared to 2001. The net increase was comprised of an increase of $12.2 million resulting from higher sales, marketing, advertising and other general cost increases, an increase of $5.2 million in charges related to an employee stock plan and an increase of $5.1 million in charges related to a long term incentive plan. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 3% in 2002 compared to 2001. Excluding the effects of the stock plan, such expenses decreased 4% as a percentage of revenue during 2002 as compared to 2001. Restructuring credit amounted to $4.5 million in 2002 as compared to a restructuring charge of $11.7 million in 2001. The 2002 credit is comprised of a reduction of $6.1 million in a facility lease obligation as a result of the Bravo transaction and a $1.6 million charge relating to the 2002 restructuring plan. Such charges include expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance, outplacement costs and other related costs, and facility realignment. The 2001 restructuring charges represent the expenses associated with facility realignment. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $15.3 million (28%) for the year ended December 31, 2002 when compared to 2001. An increase of approximately $21.1 million resulted from depreciation of new fixed assets and amortization of acquired intangibles. Partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of $5.8 million, which resulted from the Companys adoption of Statement 142 as of January 1, 2002 where certain intangible assets are no longer amortized. 64 Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for Madison Square Garden. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding the restatement of the 2002 and 2001 financial statements. Years Ended December 31, 2002 2001 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 789,677 100 % $ 841,912 100 % Technical and operating expenses 530,787 67 612,891 73 Selling, general and administrative expenses 141,473 18 143,195 17 Restructuring charges 550 2,750 Depreciation and amortization 60,167 8 96,259 11 Operating income (loss) $ 56,700 7 % $ (13,183 ) (2 )% Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2002 declined $52.2 million (6%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decreases from: Lower affiliate rates, a decline in advertising revenues, and a loss of broadcast television fees primarily from the loss of New York Yankee programming rights. $ (65.2 ) Absence of ticket sales from Knicks playoff games (6.4 ) Absence of a touring show that ended in 2001 (4.0 ) Fewer events at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall, partly offset by higher ticket revenues primarily due to the mix of events (1.3 ) Increases from: Higher revenue from Radio City Entertainments Christmas Shows presented at cities outside of New York, mostly due to two additional cities 12.7 Corporate event in 2002 with no comparable event in 2001 6.4 Higher Knicks regular season revenues attributable to ticket price increases and the teams share of higher league wide television revenue. 2.6 Other net increases 3.0 $ (52.2 ) Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $82.1 million (13%) as compared to 2001. This decline is primarily attributable to lower operating costs at MSG Networks of $57.4 million, mostly due to the absence of the costs to telecast the New York Yankee games, and lower provisions for certain player transactions of $41.1 million (which includes the anticipated luxury tax associated with Knicks players who had season or career ending injuries). In addition, luxury tax declined by $26.7 million, primarily due to adjustments made to luxury tax accruals payable to the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 2002, a credit was recorded reflecting the reversal of provisions recorded in prior periods as the NBA announced that there would be no luxury tax assessment for the 2001/2002 season following the audit of all NBA clubs. 65 These declines were partially offset by the absence of a $30.0 million credit recorded in 2001 as a result of the settlement of certain litigation with the Yankees, LP. Other items partially offsetting the declines were higher team compensation of $4.3 million, a net increase in costs associated with certain revenue items discussed above of $3.2 million, higher theatrical development costs of $1.4 million and other net cost increases aggregating $4.2 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $1.7 million (1%) as compared to the 2001 level. This decrease is due primarily to the absence of a provision of $8.8 million recorded in 2001 for severance, a decline in legal fees associated with the Yankees, LP litigation of $3.0 million, as well as an increase in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of a credit related to Cablevisions stock plan of $1.3 million. These items were partially offset by an increase in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of the expense related to Cablevisions long term incentive plan of $3.4 million, higher professional, marketing and business development fees of $3.5 million, as well as other net cost increases of $4.5 million. Restructuring charges of $2.8 million in 2001 represent the expenses associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs. The charges of $0.5 million in 2002 represent employee severance payments made in excess of accrued balances. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 decreased $36.1 million (37%) as compared to 2001 due primarily to lower amortization expense relating to the implementation of Statement 142. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $453.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $405.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The 2003 cash provided by operating activities resulted from $451.5 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non cash items and a net increase in cash resulting from changes in assets and liabilities of $2.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $405.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $217.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2002 cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from $568.1 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non cash items, partially offset by a net decrease in cash resulting from changes in assets and liabilities of $162.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities amounted to $217.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2001 cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from a net decrease in cash resulting from changes in assets and liabilities of $325.6 million, partially offset by $108.5 million of income before depreciation and amortization and non cash items. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $618.0 million compared to $1,339.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The 2003 investing activities consisted of $888.4 million of capital expenditures and $179.7 million of payments for acquisitions, partially offset by net cash distributions from equity investees of $443.4 million and other net cash proceeds of $6.7 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1,339.5 million compared to $295.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. The 2002 investing activities consisted of $1,320.7 million of capital expenditures and other net cash payments of $18.8 million. 66 Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $295.1 million and consisted of $1,349.1 million of capital expenditures and other net cash payments of $64.2 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of cable assets and programming interests of $1,118.2 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $398.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to $983.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. In 2003, the Companys financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from collateralized indebtedness of $330.7 million, net bank debt proceeds of $271.3 million and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of $75.0 million, partially offset by repayment of a note to MGM of $250.0 million and other net cash payments of $28.9 million. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $983.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to $651.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2002, the Companys financing activities consisted primarily of $1,079.1 million of net bank debt proceeds, partially offset by other net cash payments of $95.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $651.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2001, the Companys financing activities consisted primarily of $1,549.4 million of proceeds from collateralized indebtedness, $996.8 million from the issuance of senior notes and $239.3 million of proceeds from prepaid interest rate derivative contracts, partially offset by net bank debt repayments of $1,609.8 million, payments for the redemption of senior subordinated notes of $466.7 million and other net cash payments of $57.6 million. Discontinued Operations The net effect of discontinued operations on cash was $33.0 million, $32.1 million and $69.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. CSC HOLDINGS, INC. The operations of CSC Holdings are identical to the operations of Cablevision, except for interest income of $3.8 million and related income tax expense of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 included in CSC Holdings consolidated statement of operations which is eliminated in Cablevisions consolidated statement of operations. In addition, prior to the implementation of Statement 150 on July 1, 2003, dividends attributable to the Series H and Series M Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings were reported in minority interests in the consolidated financial statements of Cablevision. Dividends attributable to the Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings have been reported in minority interests in the consolidated financial statements of Cablevision. Refer to Cablevisions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries, no borrowings and no public securities outstanding other than our Cablevision NY Group Class A and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock. Funding for our subsidiaries is generally obtained through separate financial arrangements made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined) and to our Rainbow and Madison Square Garden business segments. 67 The Restricted Group, which includes CSC Holdings and its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television and high speed Internet access operations, as well as our commercial telephone and modem operations throughout the New York metropolitan area, is our principal borrower. We have historically raised funds through the issuance of public securities, including senior and subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances of CSC Holdings, as well as through borrowings under a bank credit facility. During 2003, the Restricted Group funded the requirements of the Telecommunications Services segment, Rainbow DBS, and certain other general corporate requirements. Effective January 1, 2004, we reorganized the funding of certain of our businesses in light of the announcement of our intention to spin off Rainbow DBS, three of Rainbows national programming networks and certain other businesses (see "Recent Events" below). As a result, in 2004, the Restricted Group is expected to fund (i) requirements of the Telecommunications Services segment, (ii) requirements, if any, of certain Rainbow Media Holdings programming businesses that are expected to remain with Cablevision upon completion of the spin off (primarily our fuse subsidiary, our regional news operations, and the Regional Programming Partners subsidiaries), and (iii) certain other general corporate requirements. The Restricted Group is also expected to fund certain Rainbow DBS expenditures planned for, but not funded, during 2003. The Restricted Group may also from time to time, make other investments as permitted under its credit facility. Rainbow Media Holdings, which comprises the Companys programming operations, is currently funded through cash from operations and borrowings under an $823 million credit facility made available to Rainbow Media Holdings. Madison Square Gardens funding requirements are primarily provided through cash from operations and were provided as well by borrowings under a $500 million credit facility. In March 2004, borrowings under the MSG credit facility were repaid in full and the credit facility was terminated with proceeds from an intercompany loan from Regional Programming Partners. The following table summarizes our outstanding debt, present value of capital leases, redeemable preferred stock and exchangeable preferred stock as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003: Restricted Group Other Entities Total (dollars in thousands) Senior Debt: CSC Holdings bank debt $ 1,513,039 $ $ 1,513,039 Rainbow bank debt and capital leases 752,464 752,464 MSG bank debt and capital leases 117,334 117,334 Other senior debt and capital leases 10,890 48,168 59,058 Notes payable 150,000 150,000 CSC Holdings senior notes and debentures 3,692,699 3,692,699 Collateralized indebtedness relating to stock monetization 1,617,620 1,617,620 CSC Holdings subordinated debentures 599,203 599,203 Total debt 5,815,831 2,685,586 8,501,417 Redeemable preferred stock of CSC Holdings 1,544,294 1,544,294 Exchangeable participating preferred stock of CSC Holdings 80,001 80,001 Total debt and preferred stock $ 7,440,126 $ 2,685,586 $ 10,125,712 Interest expense $ 510,396 $ 105,280 $ 615,676 Capital expenditures $ 758,716 $ 129,655 $ 888,371 68 Total amounts payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2003 and thereafter, including capital leases and the value deliverable at maturity under monetization contracts, are as follows: Restricted Group Other Entities Total (dollars in thousands) 2004 $ 127,453 $ 129,011 $ 256,464 2005 3,808 657,156 660,964 2006 1,512,000 1,164,480 2,676,480 2007 934,181 201,375 1,135,556 2008 1,610,113 460,078 2,070,191 Thereafter 3,300,000 211,973 3,511,973 Total $ 7,487,555 $ 2,824,073 $ 10,311,628 Recent Events Purchase of Fox Sports Networks 50% Interest in Fox Sports Chicago and Fox Sports Bay Area In December 2003, Regional Programming Partners purchased the 50% interests in Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area that had been held by Fox Sports Networks pursuant to the exercise of Fox Sports Networks put right. Consideration for the purchase, which totaled $110 million for the 50% interest in Fox Sports Bay Area and $40 million for the 50% interest in Fox Sports Chicago, was paid by the issuance of $110 million and $40 million promissory notes to Fox Sports Networks. The notes were issued by subsidiaries of Regional Programming Partners and secured solely by Regional Programming Partners 100% interest in Fox Sports Net Bay Area. Both of the notes bear interest at the prime rate plus 1% and mature in December 2006. The results of operations of Fox Sports Bay Area and Fox Sports Chicago have been consolidated with our results of operations as of the acquisition date and the full amount of both promissory notes are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. 69  Planned Spin off of Satellite Service and Three Rainbow Media National Entertainment Services In October 2003, we announced that our board of directors had approved an amended plan to spin off our recently launched satellite service, Rainbow DBS, along with three of Rainbow Media Holdings national entertainment services AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment, their subsidiaries, and certain other Rainbow businesses. Completion of the spin off is subject to a number of conditions, including the refinancing of the existing Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility (which is expected to provide funding for the DBS business as well as refinance all then existing Rainbow Media Holdings indebtedness), receipt of a tax ruling from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have received a tax ruling from the IRS and expect to file the Form 10 in the second quarter of 2004. We expect to complete the spin off after the Form 10 is declared effective. In anticipation of the spin off, on December 31, 2003, we distributed $100 million in cash on hand from AMC and The Independent Film Channel to CSC Holdings, and beginning January 1, 2004, we reorganized the funding of certain businesses to reflect the proposed spin off structure. Quadrangle Exercise of Put Option In October 2003, Quadrangle Capital Partners LP exercised its right to require CSC Holdings to purchase all of its Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock. Terms of the agreement provide for the delivery of cash or registered equity securities of Cablevision in settlement of the put right. We are currently in discussions with Quadrangle as to the process for determining the put price, which is expected to exceed $115 million, and following that determination will determine the form and timing of the payment of the put price. Repurchase of MGMs 20% Interest in Rainbow Media National Services In July 2003, we repurchased MGMs 20% interest in each of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million, comprised of $250 million in cash paid at closing and a $250 million promissory note issued by Cablevision Systems Corporation that matured in December 2003 and was repaid with proceeds from a new term loan at Rainbow Media Holdings. The purchase was initially effected by certain unrestricted subsidiaries of CSC Holdings with advances from AMC and Rainbow Media Holdings from cash and available bank borrowings; however, in December 2003, the 20% interests were contributed by the CSC Holdings subsidiaries to Rainbow Media Holdings in connection with the closing of the new term loan and repayment of the promissory note (see "Rainbow Media Holdings" section for a discussion of the new term loan and related activity). Northcoast Communications In May 2003, Northcoast Communications completed its sale of PCS licenses to Verizon Wireless for approximately $763.0 million in cash. Of the proceeds, approximately $51.0 million was used by Northcoast Communications to retire debt. The remaining proceeds, after payment of expenses, were distributed to the partners of Northcoast Communications, including the Company, which owns a 49.9% interest in Northcoast Communications. The Companys share of the proceeds was approximately $651.0 million, of which $30.0 million is being held in an escrow fund to provide for any post closing adjustments and any potential indemnification claims. All of the funds the Company received were used to repay bank debt under the Restricted Group credit facility. Monetization of General Electric Common Stock In January 2003, Rainbow Media Holdings monetized the value of the General Electric common stock received in connection with the sale of the Bravo programming service through the execution of 70 prepaid forward contracts, collateralized by an equivalent amount of the underlying General Electric stock. These contracts set a floor and cap on the Companys participation in the changes in the underlying stock price and at maturity are expected to offset declines in the fair value of the General Electric stock below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the cap price. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of General Electric stock, with a value determined by reference to the stock price at maturity. Cash proceeds of $314 million received in the transactions were distributed to CSC Holdings and were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the Restricted Groups credit facility. These contracts are obligations of certain unrestricted subsidiaries of Rainbow Media Holdings; however, CSC Holdings provided a guarantee of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and any early termination obligations. The amount of the guarantees is capped at $36.1 million in the aggregate. Monetization of Leapfrog Common Stock In April 2003, we monetized 800,000 shares of Leapfrog common stock, acquired through an investment in convertible preferred stock of Leapfrog made in March 2001, through a prepaid forward contract, collateralized by an equivalent amount of the underlying stock. The contract sets a floor and cap on our participation in the changes in the underlying stock price and at maturity is expected to offset declines in the fair value of Leapfrog stock below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the cap price. At maturity, the contract provides for the option to deliver cash or shares of Leapfrog stock, with a value determined by reference to the stock price at maturity. Cash proceeds, net of prepaid interest, of $16.7 million were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under the Restricted Groups credit facility. The monetization contract is an obligation of an unrestricted subsidiary of CSC Holdings. Restricted Group As of December 31, 2003, our Restricted Group consisted of: CSC Holdings and all of its subsidiaries holding our cable and digital cable operations, which encompassed approximately 2.9 million and 0.9 million subscribers, respectively; our consumer high speed Internet access operations, which encompassed approximately 1.1 million subscribers; and the commercial telephone and high speed Internet access operations of Lightpath throughout the New York metropolitan area. The Restricted Groups primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations, its bank credit facility and its access to the capital markets as evidenced by CSC Holdings outstanding senior and senior subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances and proceeds from asset sales. In addition, during 2003, the Restricted Group received cash distributions of $550.0 million from Rainbow Media Holdings ($250.0 million of which was used to repay the $250.0 million promissory note issued to MGM) comprised of $50.0 million received in March, $100.0 million received in December in connection with the spin off plan, $150.0 million of which was distributed temporarily from proceeds of the new Rainbow Media Holdings term loan in December and is expected to be contributed to Rainbow DBS during 2004 to fund a portion of its cash requirements. Currently, the Restricted Group has a $2.4 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks. Borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by certain of the Restricted Group subsidiaries. The facility matures on June 30, 2006, requires no interim commitment reductions, and permits maximum leverage of 6.75 times cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement) through March 31, 2004 and 6.25 times cash flow through March 31, 2005. The leverage ratio (as defined) was 5.8 times as of December 31, 2003. As of March 1, 2004, the Restricted Group had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $1,565.0 million and outstanding letters of credit of $50.9 million, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $784.1 million. The revolver contains several financial covenants, including debt to cash flow, cash flow to interest expense, and cash flow to debt service expense (all as defined in the credit agreement), as well as restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds, that may limit 71 our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder. The Restricted Group has also issued senior public and senior subordinated public indentures, which also contain financial and other covenants, though they are generally less restrictive than the covenants contained in the Restricted Groups credit facility. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms in the Restricted Groups credit facility or in any of CSC Holdings other debt or preferred stock securities that are based on downgrades to our credit ratings by any rating agency. The Restricted Groups capital requirements associated with the roll out of its new services such as digital video and Voice Over Internet Protocol, as well as the start up losses associated with the new Voice Over Internet Protocol product, and certain other corporate expenses, create a net funding requirement. In addition, the Restricted Group is expected to fund the balance of the 2003 approved, unspent investment of $262 million in Rainbow DBS in 2004, totaling approximately $87 million. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group, including the investment in Rainbow DBS, as well as an estimated amount for the Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock redemption, to the extent we elect to settle in cash, will be met with borrowings under the Restricted Groups existing bank credit facility and that the Restricted Groups available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet these requirements for the next twelve months. Any significant additional investments of the Restricted Group may require additional funding. Cablevisions and CSC Holdings future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. In July 2003, Moodys placed CSC Holdings credit ratings on negative outlook and Standard & Poors placed CSC Holdings credit ratings on credit watch with negative implications. In October 2003, both agencies reaffirmed the ratings and the outlooks for CSC Holdings. Any downgrade to the CSC Holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. Rainbow Media Holdings Financing for Rainbow Media Holdings has historically been provided by a combination of cash flow from operations, bank credit facilities, intercompany borrowings, sales of interests in programming entities, and, from time to time, by equity contributions from partners. In December 2003, we combined the $299.7 million Rainbow Media Holdings and the $74.9 million AMC/The Independent Film Channel/WE credit facilities into one facility at Rainbow Media Holdings and refinanced and increased the term loan component of the credit facility by $450 million. $250 million of the proceeds of the new facility were distributed to Cablevision and used to repay the outstanding promissory note issued to MGM as consideration for the 20% interest in AMC, The Independent Film Channel, and WE acquired in July 2003. Upon receipt of the distribution, the 20% interests in such channels held outside of Rainbow Media Holdings were contributed to Rainbow Media Holdings. $150 million of the proceeds were temporarily distributed to CSC Holdings; however, the full balance is expected to be contributed to Rainbow DBS during 2004 to cover its funding requirements. The balance of the loan proceeds were used to reduce outstanding bank debt under Rainbow Media Holdings revolver. The amended Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility is an $823 million credit facility consisting of a $200 million revolving credit facility and a $623 million term loan maturing March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009, respectively. The facility is secured primarily by the assets of and guaranteed by AMC, the Independent Film Channel, and WE. Rainbow Media Holdings 100% interest in the stock of these entities is also pledged as collateral. The term loan requires quarterly amortization beginning December 31, 2003 through 2008 and revolver commitment reductions begin in June 2005. Principal covenants include maximum senior leverage of 4.50 times cash flow (as defined, based on the combined 72 cash flows of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE) through June 30, 2004, reducing to 4.25 times cash flow through September 30, 2004 and 4.00 times cash flow through March 31, 2005 and maximum total leverage of 5.50 times cash flow through September 30, 2004, reducing to 5.25 times thereafter through March 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2003, the senior and total leverage ratios were 4.1 times cash flow. As of March 1, 2004, Rainbow Media Holdings had outstanding borrowings under its credit facility of $732.5 million and outstanding letters of credit of $3.2 million, resulting in undrawn commitments of $87.3 million. Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility contains several financial covenants, including debt to cash flow, cash flow to interest expense, and cash flow to debt service expense (all as defined in the credit agreement), as well as restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds, that may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available thereunder. The facility also limits the amount of investment in Rainbow DBS, CSC Holdings and Cablevision. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms based upon downgrades to our credit ratings by any rating agency in Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility. On November 11, 2003, the Company announced it would restate its previously reported financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2003 and that as a result of such restatement it would seek a waiver of any potential default or event of default under its Rainbow Media Holdings and previously existing AMC/The Independent Film Channel/WE credit facilities. That waiver was obtained from bank lenders in November 2003. Currently the AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE partnerships generate net free cash flow; however, certain developmental activities undertaken by Rainbow Media Holdings, such as the Mag Rack service and other video on demand programming and content services being developed, require funding. Such funding may be obtained through cash generated from other Rainbow Media Holdings operations or through borrowings under the Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility. We believe we have sufficient availability from cash from operations and committed credit facilities to fund Rainbow Media Holdings cash requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, as discussed under "Recent Events," as of January 1, 2004, we reorganized the funding of certain businesses in anticipation of our announced spin off plan and, as a result, Rainbow Media Holdings is also expected to fund a portion of the requirements of Rainbow DBS (see "Rainbow DBS" discussion below). Rainbow Media Holdings future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. In December 2003, Moodys eliminated the credit watch for potential downgrade status for the Rainbow Media Holdings bank credit facility that it had initiated in October 2003; however, both Moodys and Standard & Poors maintain a negative outlook on the rating. Any downgrade to the Rainbow Media Holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase Rainbow Media Holdings interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. Madison Square Garden Madison Square Gardens primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and its $500 million revolving credit facility. This facility was due to mature on December 31, 2004. In March 2004, borrowings under the MSG credit facility were repaid in full and the credit facility was terminated with proceeds from a $146 million intercompany loan from Regional Programming Partners. Madision Square Gardens funding requirements for the next twelve months will be met by its cash on hand and internally generated funds, intercompany loans from Regional Programming Partners, and or new bank borrowings or loans from the partners of Regional Programming Partners. 73 Rainbow DBS Rainbow DBS business is a start up venture with significant cash requirements and it has limited access to funding, given its early stage of operations. Funding needs for Rainbow DBS operations in 2004, which include capital investment (except as noted below with respect to MVDDS), start up losses, and funds required to develop its proprietary VOOMsm HD programming channels, are expected to total $399 million. Of this amount, $237 million is being provided by Cablevision as an equity investment on or prior to the date of the spin off. In addition, Rainbow Media Holdings has the ability to borrow up to $100 million under its credit agreement (subject to covenant compliance and availability) and use proceeds of those borrowings to make equity investments in Rainbow DBS. We believe that these investments will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements of Rainbow DBS through the date of the spin off, assuming that it occurs on or prior to the end of the third quarter of 2004. Rainbow Media Holdings has an $823 million credit facility (with $87.3 million of undrawn commitments as of March 1, 2004). Of that amount, up to $100 million may be drawn to fund the investments referred to above. All of the borrowings under the Rainbow Media Holdings credit facility will be required to be repaid prior to the date of the spin off. We expect the funds necessary for that repayment to come from new debt issued by AMC, IFC and WE. All of the then outstanding borrowings under the Rainbow Media Holdings credit agreement referred to above would be required to be repaid from the new borrowings. We anticipate that the remaining proceeds of the financings could, subject to certain limitations and financial covenants, be used by the borrowers to make investments in Rainbow DBS. The ability of AMC, IFC and WE to invest in Rainbow DBS will be primarily subject to (i) compliance with a total debt to cash flow covenant, based on the cash flow of AMC, IFC and WE, and (ii) annual and cumulative investment basket limitations on the amounts available for distribution and investment. The need to finance the development of the Rainbow DBS business will limit the funding available to support the Rainbow Media national services businesses included in the spin off. There can be no assurances as to the ability of the Company, Rainbow Media Holdings, AMC, IFC or WE to secure any of this new financing. If sufficient financing cannot be raised prior to the spin off, the spin off will not occur. The funding described above, if available to the full extent we currently expect, would provide funding to cover the anticipated cash requirements of Rainbow DBS for the next twelve months. Rainbow DBS also has not identified a source of funding for the construction and launch of the five Ka band satellites for which Rainbow DBS has FCC authorization. Nor has Rainbow DBS identified financing sources to replace funds used for the acquisition of the MVDDS licenses, though Rainbow DBS might seek such funding from the Restricted Group or other sources. Additionally, Rainbow DBS has not identified financing sources for the build out of the infrastructure to exploit the MVDDS licenses. 74  Commitments and Contingencies Commitments and contingent obligations not reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2003 are summarized in the following table: 2004 2005 06 2007 08 Thereafter Total (dollars in thousands) Restricted Group: Letters of credit $ 50 $ 53,289 $ $ $ 53,339 Guarantees 30,881 1,197 476 32,554 Contractual commitments 82,785 8,000 1,600 92,385 Operating leases(1) 49,965 90,896 83,077 149,984 373,922 163,681 153,382 85,153 149,984 552,200 Other Entities: Letters of credit 12,803 12,803 Guarantees 12,362 12,362 Contractual commitments(2) 431,634 473,325 325,785 1,037,224 2,267,968 Operating leases(1) 44,572 82,801 65,068 344,058 536,499 501,371 556,126 390,853 1,381,282 2,829,632 $ 665,052 $ 709,508 $ 476,006 $ 1,531,266 $ 3,381,832 (1)Approximately $30,128 and $1,048 of operating lease commitments for the Restricted Group and other entities, respectively, have been accrued at December 31, 2003 in connection with the 2001 and 2002 restructuring plans. (2)Represents primarily professional sports teams broadcast rights payments and sports teams personnel contracts of MSG. Approximately $60,084 of commitments relating to certain sports teams and broadcast personnel have been accrued at December 31, 2003. Restricted Group The Restricted Groups outstanding guarantees of $32.6 million consist primarily of guarantees by CSC Holdings in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations and potential early termination events in connection with the monetization, by certain of its subsidiaries that are not included in the Restricted Group, of the Companys holdings of Charter Communications, General Electric, and Adelphia Communications common stock. Amounts payable under such monetization guarantees are estimated as of a particular point in time by the financial institution counterparty and are based upon the current price of the underlying common stock and various other assumptions, including stock market volatility and prevailing interest rates. Such guaranteed amounts approximate the fair value of the monetization indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar as reflected in the Companys accompanying balance sheet. The Restricted Groups letters of credit outstanding consist primarily of letters of credit obtained by CSC Holdings in favor of insurance providers and certain governmental authorities for the Telecommunications Services segment. Contractual commitments attributable to the Restricted Group in the table above represent primarily minimum purchase requirements incurred in the normal course of its operations. The Restricted Groups minimum operating lease payments represent primarily future payment commitments resulting from the Companys non cancelable leases of certain office space and, through 2006, rental space on utility poles, used in its distribution of services. 75 Other Entities The dollar amounts reflected under the heading "Contractual Commitments" for our subsidiaries that are not included in the Restricted Group consist primarily of the following: (i) long term rights agreements which provide Madison Square Garden with exclusive broadcast rights to certain live sporting events in exchange for minimum contractual payments, and (ii) commitments under employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel and players of Madison Square Garden, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination (certain of these payments are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met). In addition to the above amounts, Madison Square Garden may also be obligated to pay the National Basketball Association ("NBA") a luxury tax each year pursuant to the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (the "Agreement"), which is in effect through June 30, 2005. The ultimate calculation of any amount due would be based on a formula established by the Agreement. If the luxury tax is in effect for a given season, to the extent the Knicks salary (as defined) exceeds the luxury tax "trigger," a tax will be due to the NBA. The Company anticipates that a luxury tax will be payable in mid 2004 to the NBA for the 2003/2004 season and the Company has made the appropriate provision for the luxury tax for the year ended December 31, 2003. Operating lease commitments represent primarily future minimum payment obligations on various long term, noncancelable leases for office and storage space and lease commitments of Radio City Music Hall and Clearview Cinemas. Obligations Under Derivative Contracts To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and have only entered into transactions with counterparties that are rated investment grade. All of our interest rate derivative contracts are entered into by CSC Holdings and are thus attributable to the Restricted Group; all such contracts are carried at their current fair market values on our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2003, the notional value of all such contracts was $600 million and the fair value of these derivative contracts was $0.3 million, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a net loss on interest swap contracts of $6.5 million, as detailed in the table below: Fair Market Value of Interest Rate Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2003, a net liability position $ (349 ) Less: fair market value as of December 31, 2002 (3,525 ) Change in fair market value, net 3,176 Plus: realized loss from cash interest expense (9,695 ) Net loss on interest rate swap contracts $ (6,519 ) We have also entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of AT&T, Comcast, AT&T Wireless, Charter Communications, General Electric, Adelphia Communications and Leapfrog common stock. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. In the event of an 76 early termination of any of these contracts, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The following table details our estimated early termination exposure as of December 31, 2003: AT&T Comcast AT&T Wireless Charter General Electric Adelphia Total* Collateralized indebtedness (carrying value) $ (294.6 ) $ (475.3 ) $ (224.8 ) $ (251.8 ) $ (314.0 ) $ (39.9 ) $ (1,600.4 ) Collateralized indebtedness (fair value estimate) $ (313.8 ) $ (506.5 ) $ (238.8 ) $ (263.9 ) $ (319.1 ) $ (39.9 ) $ (1,682.0 ) Derivative contract 139.8 86.7 129.4 192.9 (60.1 ) 38.0 526.7 Investment securities pledged as collateral 179.7 469.5 113.8 44.9 394.7 0.6 1,203.2 Net excess (shortfall) 5.7 49.7 4.4 (26.1 ) 15.5 (1.3 ) 47.9 Value of prepaid swaps with cross termination rights (9.2 ) (15.5 ) (8.8 ) (33.5 ) Net excess (shortfall) including prepaid swaps $ (3.5 ) $ 34.2 $ (4.4 ) $ (26.1 ) $ 15.5 $ (1.3 ) $ 14.4 *Excludes Leapfrog monetization contract which is not expected to generate a shortfall due to the prepayment of interest. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of General Electric, Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, AT&T Wireless or Leapfrog stock (as the case may be), with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. The terms of certain of the AT&T and Comcast transactions require cash settlement in an amount determined by reference to the AT&T and Comcast stock price at maturity. We currently intend to generate the cash settlement amount through proceeds from the equity collar and or a sale of the underlying common shares at maturity. See "Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in the General Electric, Adelphia Communications and Charter Communications transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2003, the fair value of our equity derivative contracts was $524.9 million, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a net unrealized loss on all outstanding equity derivative contracts of $180.1 million attributable to changes in market conditions during the period, primarily driven by higher stock prices of the underlying securities. We also recorded an 77 unrealized gain on our holdings of the underlying stocks of $231.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as shown in the following table: Fair Market Value of Equity Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2003 $ 524,895 Less: fair market value at December 31, 2002 705,020 Unrealized loss due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net $ (180,125 ) Unrealized gain on underlying stock positions due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net $ 231,836 In 2001, in connection with the AT&T and AT&T Wireless monetization contracts, CSC Holdings entered into prepaid interest rate swaps with a notional contract value of $1,115.0 million. These contracts require CSC Holdings to pay floating rates of interest in exchange for receipt of fixed rate payments, the net present value of which was paid to CSC Holdings at the inception of the transaction in a total cash amount of $239.3 million. These swaps have maturities in 2005 and 2006 that coincide with the related prepaid equity forward maturities. Certain contracts provide for early termination of the prepaid interest rate swap in the event of an early termination of the related prepaid equity forward. All of our prepaid interest rate swaps are carried at their current fair market values on our consolidated balance sheet with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2003, the fair value of our prepaid interest rate derivative contracts was $65.8 million, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded a net gain on such derivative contracts of $16.9 million as detailed below: Fair Market Value of Prepaid Interest Rate Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2003 $ (65,753 ) Less: fair market value at December 31, 2002 (102,819 ) Unrealized gain due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net 37,066 Plus: realized loss resulting from net cash payments (20,127 ) Net gain on prepaid interest rate swap contracts $ 16,939 In connection with the issuance of the Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings, we entered into an agreement with Quadrangle Capital Partners LP which grants Quadrangle the right to require us to purchase the preferred stock beginning in the third quarter of 2003 ("put option") for cash or through the issuance of our registered equity securities at our option. The exchange right and the put option have been accounted for as a derivative. Accordingly, the fair value of the exchange right and the put option has been reflected as a liability under derivative contracts in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The change in the fair value of $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 has been included in loss on derivative contracts in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Related Party Transactions We hold a 49.9% voting interest and certain preferential distribution rights in Northcoast Communications. Northcoast Communications is controlled by John Dolan, a nephew of Charles F. Dolan and a cousin of James L. Dolan, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 78 respectively. The operations of Northcoast Communications were not consolidated with those of the Company at December 31, 2003. In May 2003, Northcoast Communications completed its sale of PCS licenses to Verizon Wireless for approximately $763.0 million in cash. Of the proceeds, approximately $51.0 million was used by Northcoast Communications to retire debt. The remaining proceeds, after payment of expenses, were distributed to the partners of Northcoast Communications, including the Company. Our share of the proceeds was approximately $651.0 million, of which $30.0 million is being held in an escrow fund to provide for any post closing adjustments and any potential indemnification claims. All of the funds we received were used to repay bank debt under our Restricted Group credit facility. Northcoast Communications has the right to replace the escrow account with a letter of credit in the same amount. As a result of an agreement with Northcoast PCS, LLC (the other member in Northcoast Communications, an entity wholly owned by John Dolan), payment of indemnification claims, if any, under the Northcoast Communications/Verizon agreement for which Northcoast Communications is responsible will be made by us. Vendor financing for Northcoast Communications Cleveland operation consists of a $75 million credit facility at Cleveland PCS, LLC. This facility has no recourse to us or to Northcoast Communications, other than pursuant to a pledge by Northcoast Communications of the stock of Cleveland PCS and a guarantee of the payment by Northcoast Communications and Cablevision of the FCC indebtedness of the Cleveland PCS subsidiary which holds the Cleveland license which, as of December 31, 2003, had an outstanding balance of $2.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, Cleveland PCS was in default of the terms of this credit facility and had received notice of commitment termination and acceleration from the lender. Fox Sports Net Ohio and Cleveland Indians Baseball Club Limited Partnership (the "Indians") are parties to a multi year rights agreement under which Fox Sports Net Ohio pays license fees to the Indians in exchange for telecast rights to substantially all regular season Indians games. The Indians are owned by (i) Lawrence Dolan, a brother of Charles F. Dolan, the Companys Chairman, (ii) a trust, the beneficiaries of which are Lawrence Dolan and certain descendants of Lawrence Dolan, and (iii) certain other trusts, the beneficiaries of which are certain descendants of Charles F. Dolan, including James L. Dolan, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas C. Dolan and Patrick F. Dolan, officers of the Company and brothers of James L. Dolan. Management control of the Indians is held by Lawrence Dolan. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46, as revised in December 2003, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities, which are entities that either (a) do not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. For all variable interest entities created prior to February 1, 2003, the Company will be required to apply the provisions of FIN 46 by March 31, 2004. For variable interest entities created subsequent to January 31, 2003, FIN 46 was effective in 2003. The adoption of FIN 46 had no impact on the Companys financial condition or results of operations for entities created after January 31, 2003. The Company is still evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 46 for entities created prior to February 1, 2003. It is reasonably possible that the Company will be required to consolidate its investment in Northcoast Communications, LLC. See Note 14 of Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed description of this investment.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the Comcast, AT&T, 79 Charter Communications, AT&T Wireless, General Electric, Leapfrog Enterprises and Adelphia Communications common stock held by us. We have entered into prepaid forward contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. In the event of an early termination of any of these contracts, we would be obligated to repay the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. As of December 31, 2003, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast, AT&T, Charter Communications, AT&T Wireless, General Electric, Leapfrog and Adelphia Communications common stock aggregated $1,224.5 million. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $122.4 million. As of December 31, 2003, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of these securities aggregated $524.9 million, a net receivable position. The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via a prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: Cap Price ** Security # of Shares Deliverable Hedge Price per Share* Maturity Low High Comcast 7,159,205 7,159,206 2005 2006 $ 35.90 $38.47 $ 46.62 $ 63.91 AT&T 4,426,093 4,426,093 2005 2006 $ 34.39 $42.08 $ 44.71 $ 61.21 Charter Communications 1,862,229 5,586,687 3,724,460 2005 2006 2007 $ 22.35 $22.92 $ 32.24 $ 38.33 AT&T Wireless 7,121,583 7,121,583 2005 2006 $ 16.84 $18.65 $ 27.62 $ 33.15 General Electric 12,742,033 2006 $ 23.14 $25.67 $ 27.76 $ 30.81 Adelphia Communications 1,010,000 2005 $ 39.04 $40.04 $ 62.57 $ 63.57 Leapfrog 800,000 2007 $ 23.55 $24.55 $ 29.87 $ 30.87 *Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. **Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of 80 higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. In addition, from time to time we may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2003, the fair value of our fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock liabilities of $7,714.7 million exceeded their carrying value of $7,328.5 million by approximately $386.2 million. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR based market rates and thus approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2003 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt and redeemable preferred stock liabilities by approximately $268.6 million to $7,983.3 million. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Derivative Contracts: As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of $600 million. As of December 31, 2003, the fair market value and carrying value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately $0.3 million, a net liability position, as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates from December 31, 2003 prevailing levels would not change the fair value of these contracts as they are nearing maturity. In addition, we had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of $1,115.0 million entered into in connection with our monetization transactions. As of December 31, 2003, such contracts had a fair market value and carrying value of $65.8 million, a net liability position, reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2003 prevailing levels would increase the fair market value of our liabilities under derivative contracts by approximately $20.0 million to a liability of $85.8 million.
