CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including capital market characteristics, the effectiveness of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. Telecommunications In our Telecommunications segment we derive revenues principally through monthly payments by subscribers to our video, high speed data and voice services. These monthly payments include charges for cable television programming, as well as, in many cases, equipment rental, pay per view and video on demand charges, high speed data and payments for VoIP services. Revenue increases are derived from increases in the number of subscribers to these services, upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe and additional services sold to our existing subscribers. We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available to cable television systems. Revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems. By far the most serious challenge we face in our provision of cable television video services, which accounted for 46% of our consolidated revenues in 2004, comes from competition from the direct broadcast satellite business. There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have. We intend to compete with these DBS competitors by "bundling" our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high speed data service and VoIP service carried over the cable distribution plant, as well as by providing "on demand" services that are currently unavailable to a DBS subscriber. Our high speed data services business, which accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues in 2004, faces competition from DSL providers. These providers have become increasingly aggressive in their pricing strategies in recent years, and customers may decide that a reduced price is more important to them than the superior speed that cable modems provide. In addition, with 46% of our basic subscribers now subscribing to our high speed data service, opportunities to expand that base at the current pace may be limited. The recent gains in cable modem penetration may therefore not be indicative of the results we achieve in the future. Our consumer VoIP offering is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited United States and Canada long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price. To the extent the incumbents, who have financial resources that exceed those of the Company, decide to meet our pricing and or features or reduce their pricing, future growth and success of this business may be impaired. The regulatory framework for cable modem service and VoIP service is being developed and differing regulatory alternatives will be considered, including increased regulation, which may affect our competitive position. Lightpath, our commercial telephone and broadband business, operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies both incumbent local exchange companies, other competitive local 38 exchange companies and long distance companies. To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of the Company may be impaired. The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless, data medium. Should this trend accelerate dramatically, future growth of Lightpath may be impaired. In addition, the telephone companies may find technological or other solutions to upgrade their service offering, providing additional competition for our video, data and voice service offerings. Rainbow In our Rainbow segment, which accounted for 22% of our consolidated 2004 revenues, we earn revenues in two principal ways. First, we receive affiliate fee payments from operators of cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite operators. These revenues are earned under multi year affiliation agreements with those companies. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks. The second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising. Under our agreements with cable and satellite operators we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programs. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees. This is because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis, not under long term contracts. Also our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services. We seek to grow our revenues in the Rainbow segment by increasing the number of cable systems and satellite providers that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable systems and satellite services that receive our programming. We refer to this as our "penetration." AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than newer, less penetrated services. We may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for these additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fee expenses, discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period. We seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing and by airing an increased number of minutes of national advertising but, ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues are directly related to the penetration of our services and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services. The principal goals in this segment are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing penetration of our national services. To do this we must continue to contract for and produce high quality, attractive programming. Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television operators and satellite providers. This increased concentration increases the power of those operators and providers and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration. In addition, this concentration gives those distributors greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements. Moreover, as a result of this concentration the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would be more significant. In December 2003, Regional Programming Partners completed the acquisition of the 50% interests in Fox Sports Net Bay Area and Fox Sports Net Chicago that it did not already own in a transaction that was accounted for as a purchase. As a result, as of December 18, 2003, we began consolidating the results of Fox Sports Net Bay Area and Fox Sports Net Chicago. The consolidation increased the revenues and expenses in our Rainbow segment in 2004, although the amount of revenues that the Rainbow segment will receive from Fox Sports Net Chicago will decline in future periods as a result of 39 the termination by two of its significant customers that declined to carry Fox Sports Net Chicago without these distribution rights agreements. In February 2005, the Company announced it was restructuring its Regional Programming Partnership with various subsidiaries of News Corporation. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company will own 100% of Madison Square Garden and will no longer own interests in Fox Sports Ohio, Fox Sports Florida, National Sports Partners or National Advertising Partners. The Company will also own 100% of Fox Sports Net Chicago as well as 50% of Fox Sports Net New England. In addition, the $150 million promissory notes payable to News Corporation will be contributed by News Corporation to Regional Programming Partnership for no additional consideration and will thereafter be cancelled without any payment being made on them. As a result, the Company will no longer consolidate the operating results or the assets and liabilities of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida. The net revenues and operating income of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida for the year ended December 31, 2004 aggregated approximately $172.4 million and $55.7 million, respectively. The operating results of these businesses include certain allocations of general and administrative costs from the Company that may not be eliminated upon the sale of these businesses and certain other intercompany related transactions which currently eliminate in our consolidated financial statements. The pro forma effects of this transaction will be reported in the period that the transaction is consummated. The amount of cash on hand at Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida as of December 31, 2004 totaled $95 million and these entities had no indebtedness. Upon closing of the transaction, Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida will be transferred with their respective cash on hand and such cash will no longer be consolidated on our balance sheet. Madison Square Garden Madison Square Garden, which accounted for 16% of our consolidated 2004 revenues, consists of professional sports teams (principally the New York Knicks of the NBA and the New York Rangers of the NHL and the New York Liberty of the Womens National Basketball Association), the MSG Networks sports programming business, and an entertainment business, which operates the Madison Square Garden arena, Radio City Music Hall, the Hartford Civic Center and Rentschler Field (entertainment venues), and faces competitive challenges unique to these activities. We derive revenues in this segment primarily from the sale of tickets, including luxury box rentals, to sporting and entertainment events, from rental rights fees paid to this segment by promoters that present events at our entertainment venues and the sports teams share of league wide distributions of national television rights fees and royalties. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at the entertainment venues, from food, beverage and merchandise sales at the venues and from the licensing of our trademarks. MSG Networks derives its revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television and satellite providers, sales of advertising, and from rights fees paid to this segment by broadcasters and programming services that telecast events of sports teams which are under contract with MSG Networks. MSG Networks carries Knicks and Ranger games, so that, like the rest of this segment, its performance is related to the performance of the teams. All of these revenues are ultimately dependent upon the quality of our sporting and entertainment events. Madison Square Gardens short term agreement with an affiliate expired on March 7, 2005 and this affiliate has discontinued carriage of Madison Square Gardens networks. We believe we will ultimately reach contractual terms with this affiliate for carriage of MSG Networks. However, we can give no assurance as to when an agreement will be reached and therefore cannot determine the extent to which our 2005 operating results will be negatively impacted. If an agreement is not reached in 2005, the negative impact to Madison Square Gardens operating results could be significant, but the impact would not be material to the Companys consolidated operating results. 40 Our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales, paid attendance, luxury box rentals, and food, beverage and merchandise sales. To a large extent, the ability of the team to build excitement among fans and therefore produce higher revenue streams, depends on the teams winning performance, which generates regular season and playoff attendance, and which supports increases in prices charged for tickets, luxury box rentals, and advertising placement. Each teams success is dependent on its ability to acquire highly competitive personnel. The governing bodies of the NBA and the NHL have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective leagues, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing this segments results of operations. Effective September 16, 2004 the National Hockey League ("NHL") commenced a lockout of the players in support of its attempt to reach a new collective bargaining agreement with the National Hockey League Players Association. The parties failed to reach an agreement after several negotiating sessions and on February 16, 2005, the NHL announced that it had cancelled the 2004/2005 season. We can give no assurance as to when the labor dispute will be resolved and therefore can not determine the extent to which our 2005 operating results will be negatively impacted. However, while a continued lockout could have a significant adverse impact on Madison Square Gardens operating results, we do not believe it would have a significant adverse impact on the Companys consolidated operating results. The success of our MSG Networks sports programming business is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of a variety of professional sports teams in addition to our proprietary programming. The continued carriage and success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising. In the second quarter of 2004, the New York Mets gave notice of termination of their broadcast rights agreement with Madison Square Garden. The termination of the rights agreement will be effective after the 2005 baseball season. Our entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our Radio City Christmas Spectacular and our touring Christmas shows, as well as availability of, and our venues ability to attract, concerts, family shows and events. Rainbow DBS Rainbow DBS launched its VOOMSM service on October 15, 2003. The Rainbow DBS segment had not produced any revenues and incurred operating expenses of $89.7 million during 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Rainbow DBS net revenues amounted to $14.9 million and operating losses amounted to $661.4 million, including impairment charges of $354.8 million. In January 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized and directed the sale of the assets of Rainbow DBS and the shutdown of its business. On January 20, 2005, Rainbow DBS entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Rainbow 1 direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets to a subsidiary of EchoStar Communications Corp. for $200 million in cash. This transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. In February 2005, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent under which VOOM HD, LLC, a new private company formed by certain holders of Cablevision Class B Common Stock, including Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, would acquire from the Company the business, assets and liabilities of the Companys Rainbow DBS satellite business not included in the above mentioned agreement with EchoStar. The letter of intent between the Company and VOOM HD expired on February 28, 2005 without a definitive agreement being reached. Following the expiration of the letter of intent, the Company began shutting down the Rainbow DBS operations. In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan ("March 2005 Agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of Rainbow DBS from the Company. Cablevision has agreed that no new shutdown activities will be undertaken at Rainbow DBS during the term of this agreement. 41 Charles F. Dolan has agreed to fund any Rainbow DBS expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the Company cash or shares of the Companys common stock in advance of the Company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. Similarly, if Rainbow DBS makes any new commitments or other agreements, the Company will segregate cash or shares received from Charles F. Dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions. In March 2005, Charles F. Dolan deposited $10 million with the Company in accordance with the March 2005 Agreement. The March 2005 Agreement between the Company and Charles and Thomas Dolan terminates on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan has the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately. In the event of a shutdown, the Company anticipates incurring significant costs relating to early termination of various contracts, other contractual obligations, employee termination benefits and other costs. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets: The Companys long lived assets at December 31, 2004 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired ("goodwill") of approximately $1.47 billion, approximately $1.45 billion of other intangible assets and approximately $4.23 billion of property, plant and equipment. Such assets accounted for approximately 63% of the Companys consolidated total assets. On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and was required to analyze its goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal 2002, and then on a periodic basis thereafter. Statement 142 requires that goodwill impairment be determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For other long lived assets, including intangibles that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. 42 In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other long lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. For the Telecommunications Services segment, these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of homes passed, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed, among other assumptions. For the Madison Square Garden ("MSG") and Rainbow segments these valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers, number of events (MSG segment only), access to sports programming and film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell out rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Companys reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite lived intangibles, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the Companys reporting units. Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight line basis over the respective license periods. We periodically review the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service. If we determine that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, we would record a write off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films. In 2004, the Company recorded impairment losses totaling approximately $354.8 million related to its decision to seek strategic alternatives for the Rainbow DBS segment of its operations. That amount includes approximately $108.9 million that was included in technical and operating expenses representing $75.8 million for the write down of certain film and programming contracts and $33.1 million for the write off of equipment inventory and deposits. The remaining $246.0 million of the 2004 direct broadcast satellite impairment loss is included in depreciation and amortization and includes $87.7 million of impairments of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets. In addition to the Rainbow DBS impairment losses, we recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million, $17.9 million and $1.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, included in technical and operating expense, representing the impairment of certain film and programming contracts. The Company also recorded an impairment loss in 2002 of $43.2 million representing the write down of software and leasehold improvements relating to the Companys retail electronics business now reported in discontinued operations. Useful Lives Of Finite Lived Intangibles Assets The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the July 2003 repurchase of MGMs 20% interest in each of AMC, WE and IFC and the repurchase of NBCs interests in Rainbow Media Holdings in various transactions in 2001 and 2002. The Company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated 43 those lives to be 10 years for affiliation agreements and 7 to 10 years for advertiser relationships. At December 31, 2004, the carrying values, net of accumulated amortization, were $465.1 million for affiliation agreements and $78.3 million for advertiser relationships. The amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements finite lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements and the related customer relationships. The useful lives for the affiliation agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 8 to10 years is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible. There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewal. In one case during 2004, there was a 10 day period in which an affiliate was restricted from carrying certain of the Companys sports and entertainment networks because the parties had not reached agreement on contract renewal terms. We reached a short term agreement with the affiliate at the end of the 10 day period and that affiliate continuously carried the networks pursuant to successive subsequent short term agreements through March 7, 2005. However, we were unable to reach an agreement with this affiliate at expiration on March 7, 2005, and this affiliate has discontinued carriage of certain of the Companys sports networks. We believe we will ultimately reach contractual terms with this affiliate for carriage of such networks. However, if we are not successful in reaching such agreement in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment of the related affiliate and customer relationship intangibles associated with this affiliate. See "Impairment of Long lived and Indefinite Lived Assets" above. If an affiliate were to cease carrying the service on an other than temporary basis, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement. If the Company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under "Impairment Of Long Lived And Indefinite Lived Assets" for the asset group containing that intangible. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliation agreement remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2004 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization in the year ending December 31, 2005 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $9.5 million. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry 44 forwards and deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. In 2002, the income tax benefit of the Company reflects an increase in the valuation allowance of $58.6 million. At the end of the second quarter of 2002, NBC exchanged part of its interest in Rainbow Media Holdings for shares of the Companys common stock. As a result of this exchange, Rainbow Media Holdings became a member of the consolidated federal income tax return of the Company. The exchange was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the valuation allowance was reduced to zero, resulting in a reduction to the recorded goodwill, without any income statement benefit. In 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded increases in the valuation allowance of $14.0 million and $28.0 million, respectively, relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards. Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Companys cable television system, including line extensions to, and rebuild of, the Companys hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and costs incurred in the construction of the Companys headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, sub contractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. Infrastructure costs are depreciated over the 12 year estimated life of the plant, and headend facilities are depreciated over the estimated life of the specific component, ranging from 4 years for certain electronics to 15 years for tower sites. Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance and call completion fees, are expensed as incurred. In addition, the costs of connecting businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the service offering are capitalized. These costs include material, subcontractor and internal labor and related costs as discussed above. In addition, on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. New connections are amortized over 5 years or 12 years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home, respectively. The portion of departmental costs related to reconnection, programming service up and down grade, repair and maintenance, and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred. Certain of these capitalized costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics. These estimates are evaluated at least semi annually, and any changes that result, which may be significant, are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed. Restructuring Charges: In 2001, the Company recorded a charge to income representing the cost of restructuring its operations. The costs included in the charge principally consisted of employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services, and provisions for lease termination costs, including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances. 45 In 2002, the Company announced a new operating plan and restructuring which included the closing of 26 retail electronics store locations, the consolidation of customer service call centers and the elimination of certain staff positions. Additionally, in connection with the new operating plan, the Company reached an agreement with its supplier of set top boxes which reduced the Companys purchase commitments for set top boxes from $378.5 million in 2002, $378.5 million in 2003, and $567.8 million in 2004 to a total remaining commitment of $87.5 million in 2002 and nothing thereafter and required the Company to make certain other cash payments aggregating $50.0 million plus interest on a portion of such amount with respect to, among other things, a license for certain software (valued at $17.5 million based on an independent appraisal). In connection with this plan, the Company recorded restructuring charges, which included employee termination costs, such as severance pay and outplacement services costs, and provisions for lease termination costs including an estimate of costs incurred during a projected vacancy period, estimated brokerage commissions and tenant allowances and other related costs and the cost associated with the reduction in required digital set top box commitments. In 2003, the Company eliminated certain staff positions primarily at Madison Square Garden and in the Telecommunications Services segment and incurred severance costs aggregating approximately $6.1 million. In 2004, the Company recorded restructuring charges aggregating $5.7 million associated with the elimination of certain positions in various business units of the Company. Costs related to employee terminations are estimated on an individual by individual basis, giving effect to the announced severance plan. Costs for lease terminations are projected in consultation with real estate professionals. Actual lease termination costs may differ from these estimates as a result of changes in market conditions. Because these costs are based on estimates and projections, they can prove to be inaccurate. Changes in estimates, as the plan is implemented and additional facts are gathered, are reflected in current operations as adjustments to the restructuring charges, separately reported and identified. Certain Transactions The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2004 Transactions. In 2004, Rainbow DBS invested approximately $85.0 million in exchange for a substantial interest in an entity that had acquired licenses from the FCC to provide multichannel video distribution and data service in 46 metropolitan areas in the United States. In July 2004, Northcoast Communications, a 49.9% owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cleveland PCS, to an unaffiliated entity. The Company did not record any gain or loss in connection with the sale. 2003 Transactions. In March 2003, the Company transferred the stock of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cablevision Electronics Investments, Inc. to GBO Electronics Acquisition, LLC. In May 2003, Northcoast Communications completed its sale of PCS licenses to Verizon Wireless for approximately $763.0 million in cash. Of the proceeds, approximately $51.0 million was used by Northcoast Communications to retire debt. The remaining proceeds, after payment of expenses, were distributed to the partners of Northcoast Communications, including the Company. In July 2003, the Company repurchased MGMs 20% interest in each of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment for $500 million. In December 2003, Regional Programming Partners acquired News Corporations 50% interest in each of Fox Sports Net Chicago and Fox Sports Net Bay Area pursuant to News Corporations exercise of its contractual put right for $150 million. 46  2002 Transactions. In December 2002, we acquired the 17.2% interest in Rainbow Media Holdings held by National Broadcasting Company, Inc. ("NBC") in connection with the sale of Rainbow Media Holdings 80% interest in the Bravo programming service for $1.0 billion, payable in General Electric common stock and 53.2 million shares of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock (31.4 million shares of which were issuable upon the conversion of shares of Rainbow Media Holdings common stock held by NBC).

Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $333.7 million in 2004 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $14 million, non deductible preferred stock dividends, a non deductible adjustment related to the exchange right and put option related to the Series A Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings, a non deductible redemption premium related to the Series H and M Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings, state taxes, and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 1,094,199 100 % $ 764,846 100 % Technical and operating expenses 439,268 40 334,320 44 Selling, general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 328,830 30 301,408 39 Other operating income (8,496 ) (1 ) Restructuring charges (credits) 909 (48 ) Depreciation and amortization 127,414 12 102,216 13 Operating income $ 197,778 18 % $ 35,446 5 % Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $329.4 million (43%) as compared to revenues for the prior year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $27.4 million (9%) for 2004 compared to 2003.

Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for Madison Square Garden. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 778,754 100 % $ 771,986 100 % Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 561,326 72 567,870 74 Selling, general and administrative expenses 146,652 19 144,106 19 Other operating income (95,840 ) (12 ) (497 ) Restructuring 4,146 3,735 Depreciation and amortization 45,445 6 52,273 7 Operating (loss)/income $ 117,025 15 % $ 4,499 1 % 56  Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $6.8 million (1%), as compared to revenues for the prior year. This net increase is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Increases from: Higher MSG Networks revenues due mostly to higher affiliate fees, excluding impact of the cancellation of National Hockey League 2004/2005 season discussed below $ 16.4 National Basketball Association expansion revenue received in 2004 10.3 Higher other Knicks related regular season and playoff revenues 11.9 Higher revenues from Christmas Spectacular, including touring shows 15.9 Net higher revenues from other events at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall 13.3 Other net increases 9.1 Decreases from: Impact of National Hockey League cancellation of 2004/2005 season (42.7 ) Lower level of concerts and attractions held outside the Companys venues (12.2 ) Discontinuation of A Christmas Carol show at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in 2004 (15.2 ) $ 6.8 Madison Square Gardens short term agreement with an affiliate expired on March 7, 2005 and this affiliate has discontinued carriage of Madison Square Gardens networks. We believe we will ultimately reach contractual terms with this affiliate for carriage of MSG Networks. However, we can give no assurance as to when an agreement will be reached and therefore cannot determine the extent to which our 2005 operating results will be negatively impacted. If an agreement is not reached in 2005, the negative impact to Madison Square Gardens operating results could be significant, but the impact would not be material to the Companys consolidated operating results. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $6.5 million (1%) as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in costs attributable to the cancellation of the NHL 2004/2005 season. Other factors contributing to this decrease were lower costs associated with events held outside the Companys venues, the absence of the costs for A Christmas Carol due to the discontinuation of this show, as well as lower operating costs at MSG Networks. The impact of these favorable results, aggregating $75.5 million, was substantially offset by a net increase of $69.0 million. The main drivers of this net increase were higher provisions for Knicks active roster luxury tax and for certain team transactions, higher team compensation, a credit recorded in the first quarter of 2003 reflecting the reversal of a luxury tax provision attributable to a certain player who was previously waived due to a career ending injury, as well as increased costs associated with favorable revenue items discussed above. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $2.5 million (2%) as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher professional fees and promotional costs, partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to employee stock and long term incentive plans, lower provisions for severance, as well as other cost savings across the Company. Other operating income of $95.8 million in 2004 results from the notice of termination of Madison Square Gardens broadcast rights agreement with the New York Mets. In the second quarter of 2004, the New York Mets gave notice of termination of their rights agreement with Madison Square Garden, and with the notice paid Madison Square Garden a contractually obligated termination fee of $54.0 million. The termination of the rights agreement will be effective after the 2005 baseball season. In addition, Madison Square Garden recorded a $41.8 million credit reflecting the reversal of a 57 purchase accounting liability related to this rights agreement. Other operating income of $0.5 million in 2003 resulted from the sale of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications for which a reserve had been previously recorded. Restructuring charges of $4.1 million in 2004 represent severance costs associated with the elimination of certain staff positions in the first and second quarters of 2004, as well as an additional charge recorded as a result of the final cost determination for benefits associated with the elimination of certain staff positions in 2003. Restructuring charges of $3.7 million in 2003 primarily represent severance costs associated with the elimination of certain other staff positions in the second quarter of 2003. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased $6.8 million (13%) as compared to the prior year due primarily to certain intangibles and fixed assets becoming fully amortized and depreciated, respectively.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Revenues, net $ 14,935 $ Technical and operating expenses (including cost of goods sold of $32,573 and $566 in 2004 and 2003 and excluding depreciation and amortization (including impairments)) 222,175 39,792 Selling, general and administrative expenses 164,850 42,771 Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 289,356 7,105 Operating loss $ (661,446 ) $ (89,668 ) Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2004 consist primarily of programming service and equipment rental fees of $13.2 million.

The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of equipment upon installation, with an appropriate provision for returned merchandise. No revenues were recorded for the same periods in 2003 as the programming service was offered under a free promotional period and revenue related to the sale of equipment to customers was deferred until the expiration of an extended money back guarantee offer which ended in the first quarter of 2004. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, including impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $182.4 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases of $41.5 million in costs to license and develop content for the VOOM high definition channels, $20.3 million of costs primarily to operate the uplink and broadcast facility and the customer call center, $8.8 million of programming license fees and $2.9 million of costs of equipment sold and related installation. Additionally, the 2004 results include a write down to net realizable value for inventory not deployed of $29.1 million, a write down to net realizable value of licensed film assets of $75.8 million and a $4.0 million write off of deposits (related to FCC construction bonds for milestones not anticipated to be met) recorded in conjunction with the Board of Directors decision not to spin off the DBS business, but instead to seek strategic alternatives. 58 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $122.1 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to the increased activity focused on gaining new subscribers since the initial launch of the service in October 2003. The increases consist principally of $84.4 million of increased marketing and subscriber acquisition costs, including installation costs for customers who rent equipment; an increase in general and administrative expenses of $32.4 million due to increases in various costs including corporate overhead, field operations, including costs to retrieve disconnected set top boxes, information technology costs and salaries resulting from additional manpower; and an increase of $5.3 million in stock plan and long term incentive plan expenses. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $289.4 million represents primarily the impairment of long lived assets of $246.0 million recorded in conjunction with the Board of Directors decision not to spin off the DBS business, but instead to seek strategic alternatives, $35.1 million of depreciation consisting primarily of the satellite which was placed in service in October 2003 and related broadcast equipment, and $8.3 million of depreciation for equipment rented to customers including the write off of customer equipment not required to be returned by deactivated customers, consisting of satellite dishes, over the air antennas and wiring and a related provision based on estimated customer life. Outlook for Rainbow DBS. In January 2005, our Board of Directors authorized and directed the sale of the assets of Rainbow DBS and the shutdown of its operations. Rainbow DBS has entered into a contract to sell its Rainbow 1 satellite and certain other related assets to a subsidiary of EchoStar for $200 million in cash. The Company anticipates that the remaining assets of Rainbow DBS and its business will either be transferred to an entity that is not part of the Company or will be shutdown. As a result of these existing and anticipated actions, the Company anticipates that (i) Rainbow DBS will continue to incur significant operating losses that will be reflected in the Companys results for a portion of 2005; (ii) the Company may incur significant shut down costs as it exits this business; and (iii) the Company may incur further impairment charges against the carrying value of the Rainbow DBS assets. In the event of a shutdown, assuming the consummation of the Rainbow 1 sale to EchoStar, the Company does not expect any material impact to its liquidity position.

Excluding the effects of the stock plan, as a percentage of revenues such costs increased 1% during 2003 as compared to 2002. Other operating income of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the sale of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications for which a reserve had previously been recorded. Restructuring charges amounted to $10.7 million in 2003 and $74.1 million in 2002. The 2003 amount is comprised of $4.6 million in facility realignment costs relating to the 2001 restructuring, and $6.1 million of new provisions associated with the elimination of positions, including severance, outplacement costs and other related costs relating to the 2003 restructuring.

Net interest expense increased $119.1 million (25%) during 2003 compared to 2002. Approximately $87.3 million of the increase for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from the classification of dividends on CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock as interest expense in connection with the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 as of July 1, 2003 and the inclusion of such dividends for the six months ended December 31, 2003 in interest expense. The remaining increase of $31.8 million was primarily attributable to higher overall average debt balances, partly offset by lower average interest rates (weighted average of 6.3% in 2003 as compared to 6.6% in 2002) and lower interest income ($12.5 million in 2003 as compared to $22.4 million in 2002.) Equity in net income of affiliates amounted to $429.7 million in 2003 compared to equity in net loss of affiliates of $42.4 million in 2002.

Write off of deferred financing costs of $0.4 million in 2003 and $6.9 million in 2002 consist principally of costs written off in connection with amendments to, or termination of, the Companys credit agreements and the redemption of the Companys senior subordinated notes. Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) Gain (loss) due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless, Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog and Adelphia Communications shares $ (180.1 ) $ 808.1 Unrealized gain (loss) on exchange right and put option related to CSC Holdings Series A Preferred Stock (38.6 ) Unrealized and realized gains on interest rate swap contracts 10.4 115.9 $ (208.3 ) $ 924.0 Loss on extinguishment of debt amounted to $17.2 million in 2002.

For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 minority interests consists of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 (dollars in millions) News Corporations 40% share of the net income of Regional Programming Partners $ (27.4 ) $ (29.7 ) MGMs 20% share of the net income or loss of AMC, The Independent Film Channel and WE: Womens Entertainment through July 18, 2003 (17.0 ) (18.2 ) CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Preferred Stock dividend requirements through June 30, 2003* (87.2 ) (174.5 ) CSC Holdings Series A Preferred Stock dividend requirements (5.0 ) NBCs share of the net loss of Rainbow Media Holdings through December 7, 2002 2.9 Other (1.6 ) (1.1 ) $ (138.2 ) $ (220.6 ) *Beginning July 1, 2003, these dividend requirements are recorded as interest expense. Net miscellaneous income of $3.6 million for 2003 resulted primarily from dividends received on certain of the Companys investment securities. The 2002 expense of $5.7 million includes various miscellaneous expenses, partially offset by dividends on certain of the Companys investment securities. Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations of $20.4 million in 2003 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $28.0 million, non deductible preferred stock dividends, a non deductible adjustment related to the exchange right and put option related to the Series A Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings, state taxes, and an adjustment to the deferred tax rate.

Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for Madison Square Garden. Years Ended December 31, 2003 2002 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues (dollars in thousands) Revenues, net $ 771,986 100 % $ 789,677 100 % Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 567,870 74 530,787 67 Selling, general and administrative expenses 144,106 19 141,473 18 Other operating income (497 ) Restructuring charges 3,735 550 Depreciation and amortization 52,273 7 60,167 8 Operating income (loss) $ 4,499 1 % $ 56,700 7 % 66 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2003 declined $17.7 million (2%), as compared to revenues for the prior year. This net decrease is attributable to the following: (dollars in millions) Decreases from: Lower MSG Networks revenues due mostly to lower affiliate fees and advertising revenues $ (22.4 ) Corporate event in 2002 with no comparable event in 2003 (6.4 ) Fewer events at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall (4.6 ) Lower Knicks regular season revenues mostly attributable to the teams share of lower league wide television revenue (4.0 ) Other net decreases (1.7 ) Increases from: Higher level of concerts and attractions held outside the Companys venues 10.2 Award show which took place in the MSG Arena in 2003 with no comparable event in 2002 5.1 Christmas Spectacular show at Radio City Music Hall, primarily increased attendance 6.1 $ (17.7 ) Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $37.1 million (7%) as compared to the prior year. These expenses were unfavorably impacted by an increase of $15.6 million due to adjustments made to luxury tax accruals payable to the National Basketball Association ("NBA"). In 2002, MSG recorded a credit reflecting the reversal of provisions recorded in prior periods for luxury tax expense as the NBA announced that there would be no luxury tax assessment for the 2001/2002 season. In 2003, MSG recorded a credit reflecting the reversal of a luxury tax provision attributable to a certain player who was previously waived due to a career ending injury. The remaining net increase is attributable to an increase in costs associated with events held outside the Companys venues of $9.8 million, higher provisions for luxury tax relating to the Knicks active roster of $9.4 million, higher team compensation of $8.8 million, an increase in costs associated with the award show which took place in the Arena at Madison Square Garden in 2003 of $5.3 million. These increases were partially offset by $11.8 million primarily due to the absence of the costs for the corporate event discussed above and fewer events at MSG and Radio City Music Hall, as well as lower provisions for certain player transactions, including luxury tax associated with season or career ending Knicks player injuries. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.6 million (2%) as compared to the prior year primarily due to a $12.2 million increase in charges related to an employee stock plan and a $7.7 million provision recorded for severance in 2003. These increases were substantially offset by a decrease in Madison Square Gardens proportionate share of expense related to Cablevisions long term incentive plan, lower provisions for bonuses and sales commissions, as well as other cost savings across Madison Square Garden, aggregating $17.3 million. Other operating income of $0.5 million in 2003 resulted from the sale of trade accounts receivable from Adelphia Communications for which a reserve had been previously recorded. Restructuring charges of $3.7 million in 2003 primarily represent severance costs associated with the elimination of certain staff positions. Restructuring charges of $0.5 million in 2002 represent an additional charge recorded as a result of the final cost determination for benefits associated with the elimination of certain staff positions in 2001. 67 Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 decreased $7.9 million (13%) as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower amortization expense resulting from certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $39.4 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to the launch of the service in October 2003. The 2003 costs consist primarily of $16.4 million of marketing and subscriber acquisition costs, $26.0 million of general and administrative expenses including corporate overhead, field operations, information technology costs and consulting fees, and $0.4 million of stock plan and long term incentive plan expenses. The 2002 costs consist primarily of general and administrative expenses including consulting costs associated with the development of the satellite asset in preparation for launch. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2003 of $7.1 million represents primarily depreciation of the satellite that was placed in service in October 2003. CSC HOLDINGS, INC. The operations of CSC Holdings are identical to the operations of Cablevision, except for (i) interest expense of $85.0 million and related tax benefit of $35.1 million relating to $1.5 billion of Cablevision senior notes issued in April 2004 included in the Cablevision statement of operations and (ii) interest income of $3.8 million and related income tax expense of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 included in CSC Holdings consolidated statement of operations which is eliminated in Cablevisions consolidated statement of operations. In addition, prior to the implementation of Statement 150 on July 1, 2003, dividends attributable to the Series H and Series M Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings were reported in minority interests in the consolidated financial statements of Cablevision. Dividends attributable to the Series A Exchangeable Participating Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings have been reported in minority interests in the consolidated financial statements of Cablevision. Refer to Cablevisions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein. 68 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Our outstanding securities consist of Cablevision NY Group Class A and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock and $1.5 billion in debt securities (see "Recent Events" below for a more detailed description of the securities). Funding for the debt service requirements of our debt securities is provided by our subsidiary operations, as permitted by the covenants governing subsidiary credit agreements and CSC Holdings public debt securities, and we anticipate that sufficient cash distributions can be made to fund these requirements for the next twelve months. Funding for our subsidiaries is generally obtained through separate financial arrangements made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined), to our Rainbow business segment, and through cash on hand and cash flow from operations. CSC Holdings and those of its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television and high speed data service operations as well as our commercial telephone and high speed data service throughout the New York metropolitan area comprise the "Restricted Group" since they are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the $2.4 billion credit facility and the public debt issued by CSC Holdings. In 2004, the Restricted Group funded (i) requirements of the Telecommunications Services segment, (ii) requirements of certain Rainbow Media Holdings programming businesses (primarily our fuse subsidiary and our regional news operations), and (iii) certain other general corporate requirements. In 2004, the Restricted Group also funded certain Rainbow DBS expenditures planned for, but not funded, during 2003. The Restricted Group may also make other investments from time to time as permitted under its credit facility. Rainbow National Services LLC ("RNS"), our wholly owned subsidiary which owns the common equity interests in the Companys AMC, WE: Womens Entertainment and IFC programming operations, generates cash from operations and is the issuer of $800 million of senior and senior subordinated notes and the obligor on a $950 million senior secured credit facility entered into in August 2004. RNS cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings available to it have provided funding to Rainbow DBS subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in RNS financing agreements. Madison Square Gardens funding requirements have been primarily provided through cash from operations and borrowings under a $500 million credit facility. In March 2004, borrowings under the Madison Square Garden credit facility were repaid in full with proceeds from a $146.0 million equity contribution from Regional Programming Partners and the credit facility was terminated. The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and present value of capital leases as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004: Restricted Group Rainbow National Services Other Entities Total (dollars in thousands) Bank debt $ 1,889,000 $ 600,000 $ 887 $ 2,489,887 Capital leases 5,943 3,036 62,584 71,563 Notes payable 150,000 150,000 Senior notes and debentures 4,193,626 297,938 1,500,000 5,991,564 Senior subordinated debentures 250,000 496,231 746,231 Collateralized indebtedness relating to stock monetizations 1,553,427 1,553,427 Total debt $ 6,338,569 $ 1,397,205 $ 3,266,898 $ 11,002,672 Interest expense $ 485,037 $ 41,639 $ 194,646 $ 721,322 Capital expenditures $ 609,365 $ 1,003 $ 165,267 $ 775,635 69  Total amounts payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2004 and thereafter, including capital leases and the value deliverable at maturity under monetization contracts, are as follows: Restricted Group Rainbow National Services Other Entities Total (dollars in thousands) 2005 $ 4,602 $ 4,500 $ 642,213 $ 651,315 2006 1,890,028 6,000 1,031,971 2,927,999 2007 500,514 6,000 111,626 618,140 2008 500,000 6,000 36,648 542,648 2009 900,000 6,000 503,300 1,409,300 Thereafter 2,550,000 1,371,500 1,006,600 4,928,100 Total $ 6,345,144 $ 1,400,000 $ 3,332,358 $ 11,077,502 Recent Events In January 2005, monetization contracts covering 1.9 million shares of our Charter Communications stock matured. We settled our obligations under the related collateralized indebtedness by delivering an equivalent number of Charter Communications shares and the cash proceeds from the related equity derivative contract that had previously been pledged to the bank counterparty. During 2005, monetization contracts covering 4.4 million shares of AT&T stock, 7.2 million shares of Comcast stock and 1.0 million shares of Adelphia stock also mature. The Company intends to settle such transactions by either delivering shares of the applicable stock and proceeds of the equity derivative contracts or delivering cash from the proceeds of a new monetization transaction. In February 2005, the Company announced it was restructuring its Regional Programming Partnership with various subsidiaries of News Corporation. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company will own 100% of Madison Square Garden and will no longer own interests in Fox Sports Ohio, Fox Sports Florida, National Sports Partners or National Advertising Partners. In addition, the $150 million notes payable to News Corporation will be contributed to Regional Programming Partnership for no additional consideration and will thereafter be cancelled without any payment being made on them. As a result, the Company will no longer consolidate the operating results or the assets and liabilities of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida. The net revenues and operating income of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida for the year ended December 31, 2004 aggregated approximately $172.4 million and $55.7 million, respectively. The operating results of these businesses include certain allocations of general and administrative costs from the Company that may not be eliminated upon the sale of these businesses and certain other intercompany related transactions which currently eliminate in our consolidated financial statements. The pro forma effects of this transaction will be reported in the period that the transaction is consummated. The amount of cash on hand at Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida as of December 31, 2004 totaled $95 million and these entities had no indebtedness. Upon closing of the transaction, Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida will be transferred with their respective cash on hand and such cash will no longer be consolidated on our balance sheet. 70 Issuance of Debt Securities In April 2004, Cablevision issued $1.0 billion face amount of 8.0% senior notes due 2012 and $500 million face amount of floating rate senior notes due 2009. The floating rate notes bear interest based on six month LIBOR plus 4.50%. The notes are unsecured and contain covenants similar to the covenants of CSC Holdings outstanding senior public debt securities, including a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 9:1. Proceeds of the offerings, net of issuance costs, were invested in our CSC Holdings subsidiary through our purchase from CSC Holdings of its equity securities. In addition, in April 2004, CSC Holdings issued $500 million face amount of 63/4% senior notes due 2012. The proceeds, net of issuance costs, along with the net proceeds received as equity contributions from Cablevision, were used to repay bank borrowings temporarily. Approximately $1.8 billion was reborrowed to fund certain debt redemptions described below. In August 2004, RNS put in place a $950 million senior secured credit facility ($350 million of which is a revolving credit facility and $600 million of which is a term loan facility) and issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 83/4% senior notes due 2012 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 103/8% senior subordinated notes due 2014. Proceeds of the financings totaling $1,366.1 million were distributed to Rainbow Media Enterprises, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings) which in turn distributed approximately $704.9 million to Rainbow Media Holdings to repay and terminate its credit facility and collateralize outstanding letters of credit. The balance of the cash is held by Rainbow Media Enterprises. Redemption of Debt and Termination of Certain Securities In May 2004, CSC Holdings redeemed, at the relevant early redemption prices, its 113/4% Series H Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock due 2007; its 111/8% Series M Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock due 2008; its 97/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2013; and, its 97/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2023. The redemptions were completed at a total cash cost, including the applicable redemption premiums and accrued and unpaid dividends and interest, of $2.0 billion. In August 2004, CSC Holdings redeemed its Series A Preferred Stock held by Quadrangle Capital Partners LP for $150.3 million in cash funded with borrowings from the Restricted Group revolving credit facility. In October 2004, the Company received $213.6 million in cash in exchange for all 14.2 million shares it owned of AT&T Wireless common stock, representing the $15 share price paid in consideration of the merger between AT&T Wireless and Cingular Wireless LLC. The shares and resultant cash exchanged for such shares had previously been pledged in support of the repayment of the collateralized debt. As a result of that exchange, the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to its shares of AT&T Wireless were terminated. The termination provisions under the prepaid forward contracts required the Company to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and equity collars. The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.1 million representing the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the collateralized indebtedness. At December 31, 2004, the Company had settled certain collateralized indebtedness with a fair value of $124.1 million by releasing to the counterparty cash proceeds from the related prepaid forward contract totaling $20.1 million and the cash from the merger transaction of $105.0 million, both of which had been pledged in settlement of the debt. The Company received the net difference of $1.0 million in cash. The remaining collateralized indebtedness related to the AT&T Wireless shares was settled in February 2005 and accordingly, the balance sheet at December 31, 2004 reflects the redemption value of the collateralized indebtedness of $116.5 million, the fair value of the prepaid forward contracts of 71 $8.9 million and restricted cash of $108.6 million. The Company received net cash proceeds of $1.0 million in February 2005 upon settlement of this obligation. Suspension of Planned Spin off of Rainbow Media Enterprises and Sale of Rainbow DBS Assets In December 2004, the Company announced it would no longer pursue the planned spin off of Rainbow Media Enterprises in its previously proposed form and would instead pursue strategic alternatives for its Rainbow DBS business. In January 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized and directed the sale of the assets of Rainbow DBS and the shutdown of its business. On January 20, 2005, Rainbow DBS entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Rainbow 1 direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets to a subsidiary of EchoStar Communications Corp. for $200 million in cash. This transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals. In February 2005, the Company signed a letter of intent under which VOOM HD, LLC, a new private company formed by certain holders of Cablevision Class B Common Stock, including Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, would acquire from the Company the business, assets and liabilities of the Companys Rainbow DBS satellite business not included in the Companys definitive agreement with EchoStar. The letter of intent between the Company and VOOM HD expired on February 28, 2005 without a definitive agreement being reached. Following the expiration of the letter of intent, the Company began shutting down the Rainbow DBS operations. In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan ("March 2005 Agreement") pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of Rainbow DBS from the Company. Cablevision has agreed that no new shutdown activities will be undertaken at Rainbow DBS during the term of the March 2005 Agreement. Charles F. Dolan has agreed to fund any Rainbow DBS expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the Company cash or shares of the Companys common stock in advance of the Company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. Similarly, if Rainbow DBS makes any new commitments or other agreements, the Company will segregate cash or shares received from Charles F. Dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions. In March 2005, Charles F. Dolan deposited $10 million with the Company in accordance with the March 2005 Agreement. The March 2005 Agreement between the Company and Charles and Thomas Dolan terminates on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan has the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately. In the event of a shutdown, the Company anticipates incurring significant costs relating to early termination of various contracts, other contractual obligations, employee termination benefits and other costs. In the event of a shutdown, assuming the consummation of the Rainbow 1 sale to Echostar, the Company does not expect any material impact to its liquidity position. Restricted Group As of December 31, 2004, our Restricted Group consisted of: CSC Holdings and all of its subsidiaries holding our cable operations, which encompassed approximately 2.96 million subscribers (including approximately 1.48 million digital video subscribers); our consumer high speed data services operations, which encompassed approximately 1.35 million subscribers; and the commercial telephone and high speed data services operations of Lightpath throughout the New York metropolitan area. The Restricted Group has a $2.4 billion revolving credit facility in place that matures on June 30, 2006. As of March 14, 2005, total borrowings outstanding were $1,959.4 million, including $53.4 million 72 reserved for letters of credit, with a resulting undrawn commitment of $440.6 million. The credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries and contains several financial covenants, including a limitation on the ratios of debt to cash flow, cash flow to interest expense, and cash flow to debt service expense (all as defined in the credit agreement) and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds that may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available. In January 2005, the Restricted Group amended the permitted debt to cash flow ratio permitted under the credit facility. The amended covenant is 6.25 times through June 30, 2005, 5.75 times through December 31, 2005 and 5.50 times thereafter through June 30, 2006. The Restricted Group was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2004. CSC Holdings, a member of the Restricted Group, has also issued senior and senior subordinated public debentures, which also contain financial and other covenants, though they are generally less restrictive than the covenants contained in the Restricted Groups credit facility. Principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 9:1 and limitations on dividends and distributions subject to an aggregate cap. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms in the Restricted Groups credit facility or in any of CSC Holdings other debt securities that are based on changes in the credit ratings assigned by any rating agency. Sources of cash for the Restricted Group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the Restricted Group and borrowings. In April 2004, the Restricted Group also received $1.5 billion in cash proceeds from the issuance of capital stock to Cablevision that it used to redeem certain outstanding securities described above. The Restricted Groups principal uses of cash include capital spending, in particular the capital requirements associated with the roll out of its services such as digital video and Voice over Internet Protocol, debt service, including distributions made to Cablevision to service interest expense on its public debt securities, other corporate expenses and changes in working capital, as well as discretionary investments that it may fund from time to time. In addition, the Restricted Group contributed $237 million to Rainbow DBS during 2004. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group will be met with borrowings under the Restricted Groups existing bank credit facility and that the Restricted Groups available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet these requirements for the next twelve months. Cablevisions and CSC Holdings future access to the public debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by their credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. In January 2005, Standard and Poors affirmed the Companys credit ratings, removed all ratings from credit watch status, and assigned a "positive" outlook. In March 2005, Standard and Poors lowered the outlook on the Companys ratings to "developing" and affirmed all of the Companys credit ratings. Any downgrade to the Cablevision and CSC Holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. Rainbow Media Holdings Rainbow Media Holdings $820 million credit facility was repaid and terminated on August 20, 2004 with a distribution from the proceeds of the RNS financing described below. On the same date, the commitment from a bank to provide up to $250 million of senior subordinated funding to Rainbow Media Holdings which was to be guaranteed by AMC, WE and IFC was also terminated. Rainbow National Services On August 20, 2004, RNS entered into new debt financing arrangements totaling approximately $1,750 million in a combination of a senior secured credit facility totaling approximately $950 million 73 (comprised of a $600 million term loan and $350 million undrawn revolving credit facility), and senior and senior subordinated notes totaling approximately $800 million. Substantially all of the net proceeds of the new financings totaling approximately $1,366.1 million were distributed to Rainbow Media Enterprises, which in turn distributed $704.9 million to Rainbow Media Holdings to repay and terminate its credit facility and collateralize outstanding letters of credit. The balance of the cash was distributed to Rainbow Media Enterprises and will continue to be used to fund cash requirements of certain of its subsidiaries, including other programming subsidiaries, as well as certain expenditures of Rainbow DBS as described below. It may also be utilized to repay outstanding bank debt. The RNS credit facility is secured by the assets and common equity interests of AMC, WE and IFC and guaranteed by AMC, WE and IFC and Rainbow Programming Holdings, RNSs direct parent. The term loan requires amortization of 0.25% of the original outstanding balance per quarter beginning June 30, 2005 through March 31, 2011 and 23.50% of the original outstanding balance for each quarter thereafter through its maturity date. Outstanding borrowings under the facility were $600 million as of March 14, 2005, resulting in undrawn revolver commitments of $350 million. Financial covenants include (i) a maximum total leverage ratio of 6.75 times cash flow (as defined based on the combined cash flows of AMC, WE and IFC) through December 31, 2006 with reductions thereafter, (ii) a maximum senior leverage of 5.0 times cash flow, reducing to 4.75 times on October 1, 2005 with further reductions thereafter, and (iii) minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense and cash flow to debt service. Additional covenants include limitations on liens, additional indebtedness and distributions. Permitted distributions include (i) up to $150 million annually, with a cumulative limit of $600 million, to fund Rainbow DBS, and (ii) up to $50 million annually, with a cumulative limit of at $200 million, for other general purposes, and (iii) subject to maintaining a maximum ratio of total debt to cash flow of 5.0 times, distributions of up to $300 million from the proceeds of permitted future debt offerings. RNS was in compliance with all of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2004. RNSs notes offerings consisted of $300 million face amount of 83/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012, and $500 million face amount of 103/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014. Net proceeds from these offerings totaled $775.9 million. These issuances are guaranteed by substantially all of RNSs subsidiaries. Principal covenants include limitations on additional indebtedness, including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 7.0 times, reducing to 6.0 times after January 1, 2009, limitations on distributions and limitations on the ability to incur liens (as per the terms of the senior notes indenture). Although the debt service requirements of the new financings are significant, RNSs cash flow from operations (net of the debt service requirements) is expected to be sufficient to fund its commitments for the next twelve months. RNSs future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. In August 2004, Moodys and Standard & Poors assigned ratings to RNSs senior secured credit facility and senior and senior subordinated notes. In January 2005, Standard and Poors affirmed RNSs credit ratings, removed all ratings from credit watch status, and assigned a "positive" outlook. In March 2005, Standard and Poors lowered the outlook on RNSs ratings to "developing" and affirmed all of RNSs credit ratings. Any future downgrade to RNSs credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact RNSs ability to raise additional funds. Madison Square Garden Madison Square Gardens primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations and its $500 million revolving credit facility. This facility was terminated in March 2004 with proceeds from a $146 million equity contribution from Regional Programming Partners. 74 Madison Square Gardens funding requirements for the next twelve months will be met by its cash on hand and cash from operations, and or intercompany loans or equity contributions from Regional Programming Partners or borrowings under any new bank credit facilities that may be entered into by Madison Square Garden or Regional Programming Partners, although there can be no assurance that such new facility can be obtained or obtained on acceptable terms. Madison Square Garden has submitted a letter to the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority ("MTA") expressing Madison Square Gardens preliminary interest in acquiring the development rights over the MTAs Hudson Rail Yards property for an aggregate purchase price of $600 million. Madison Square Garden expects to submit a formal response to the MTAs request for proposals on March 21, 2005. If Madison Square Garden is awarded the development rights, it will require substantial amounts of funding. Such funds may be provided by cash on hand at Madison Square Garden and or its affiliates, debt financing arrangements entered into by Madison Square Garden, equity contributions from Madison Square Garden affiliates including CSC Holdings (the Restricted Group) or from new equity partners. The plans for the renovation of the Madison Square Garden arena are not yet finalized and it is not expected to require significant funding during the next twelve months. Rainbow DBS Rainbow DBS business launched its service in October 2003 and has significant cash requirements. Funding needs for Rainbow DBS in 2004 totaled approximately $462 million, $237 million of which was funded by borrowings under the Restricted Group credit facility and the balance by indebtedness incurred at Rainbow Media Holdings and RNS. Rainbow DBSs cash requirements for January and February of 2005 have been provided from cash on hand at Rainbow Media Enterprises. Rainbow DBS entered into a satellite procurement contract covering five Ka band satellites with Lockheed Martin in November 2004. The construction cost under the contract is approximately $740 million, subject to certain adjustments. This amount excludes launch costs. Rainbow DBS has the right to terminate this contract prior to November 21, 2005 without penalty. If the contract is terminated subsequent to that date, Rainbow DBS would be required to make a termination payment, which at December 31, 2005 would not be significant. Milestone payments scheduled to be made in 2005 aggregate $50.9 million. However, milestone payments would cease upon termination of the contract. The Company currently expects to transfer this obligation to an entity that is not part of the Company or terminate the contract in connection with a shutdown of the Rainbow DBS operations. In February 2005, the Company signed a letter of intent under which VOOM HD, LLC, a new private company formed by certain holders of Cablevision Class B Common Stock, including Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, would acquire from the Company the business, assets and liabilities of the Companys Rainbow DBS satellite business not included in the Companys definitive agreement with EchoStar. The letter of intent between the Company and VOOM HD expired on February 28, 2005 without a definitive agreement being reached. Following the expiration of the letter of intent, the Company began shutting down the Rainbow DBS operations. In March 2005, we entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of Rainbow DBS from Cablevision. The agreement allows Rainbow DBS to remain in operation and to continue to provide its VOOM service to subscribers while Charles and Thomas Dolan seek to arrange an alternate transaction that would avoid a shutdown of Rainbow DBS. For the period from March 1 through March 31, 2005, Charles Dolan has agreed to fund any costs incurred by Rainbow DBS above those that would have been incurred if the Company had shut down the business as of February 28, 2005. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the Company cash or shares of the Companys common stock in advance of the Company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. If shares 75 are delivered, the cash expenditures shall be paid out of cash balances at Rainbow Media Enterprises. In March 2005, $10 million in cash was delivered to the Company as an initial deposit to cover such funding requirements in accordance with the March 2005 Agreement. The agreement between the Company and Charles and Thomas Dolan terminates on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan will have the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately. In the event of a shutdown, the Company anticipates incurring significant costs relating to early termination of various contracts, other contractual obligations, employee termination benefits and other costs. In the event of a shutdown, assuming the consummation of the Rainbow 1 sale to EchoStar, the Company does not expect any material impact to its liquidity position.

The above table does not include amounts owed to Loral Space and Communications of $44.1 million payable from a percentage of future revenues of Rainbow DBS, if any, or from any future sale of all or part of the interests in or assets of Rainbow DBS in connection with Rainbow Media Holdings acquisition of Loral Space and Communications interest in Rainbow DBS (see Note 3 of Cablevisions consolidated financial statements). The above table does not include the amounts due pursuant to the agreement entered into by Rainbow DBS with Lockheed Martin for the construction of five Ka band satellites at a cost of $740 million, as Rainbow DBS has the right to terminate this contract prior to November 21, 2005 without penalty. If the contract is terminated subsequent to that date, Rainbow DBS would be required to make a termination payment, which at December 31, 2005 would not be significant. Milestone payments scheduled to be made in 2005 aggregate $50.9 million. However milestone payments would cease upon termination of the contract. Restricted Group The Restricted Groups outstanding guarantees of $20.4 million consist primarily of guarantees by CSC Holdings in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations and potential early termination events in connection with the monetization of the Companys holdings of Charter Communications, General Electric, and Adelphia Communications common stock. Amounts payable under such monetization guarantees are estimated as of a particular point in time by the financial institution counterparty and are based upon the current price of the underlying common stock and various other assumptions, including stock market volatility and prevailing interest rates. Such guaranteed amounts approximate the fair value of the monetization indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar as reflected in the Companys accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 78  The Restricted Groups letters of credit outstanding of $53.4 million consist primarily of letters of credit obtained by CSC Holdings in favor of insurance providers and certain governmental authorities for the Telecommunications Services segment. Contractual commitments attributable to the Restricted Group in the table above represent primarily minimum purchase requirements incurred in the normal course of its operations. The Restricted Groups minimum operating lease payments represent primarily future payment commitments resulting from the Companys non cancelable leases of certain office space and, through 2009, rental space on utility poles, used in its distribution of services. Other Entities The dollar amounts reflected under the heading "Contractual Commitments" for our subsidiaries that are not included in the Restricted Group consist primarily of the following: (i) long term rights agreements which provide Madison Square Garden and other regional sports networks with exclusive broadcast rights to certain live sporting events in exchange for minimum contractual payments, and (ii) commitments under employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel and players of Madison Square Garden, which provide for payments that are guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination (certain of these payments are covered by disability insurance if certain conditions are met). In addition to the above amounts, Madison Square Garden may also be obligated to pay the National Basketball Association ("NBA") a luxury tax each year pursuant to the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, which is in effect through June 30, 2005. The ultimate calculation of any amount due would be based on a formula established by the agreement. If the luxury tax is in effect for a given season, to the extent the Knicks salary (as defined) exceeds the luxury tax "trigger," a tax will be due to the NBA. The Company anticipates that a luxury tax will not be payable to the NBA for the 2004/2005 season. Operating lease commitments represent primarily future minimum payment obligations on various long term, noncancelable leases for office and storage space and lease commitments for Radio City Music Hall and Clearview Cinemas. Obligations Under Derivative Contracts To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and have only entered into transactions with counterparties that are rated investment grade. All of our interest rate derivative contracts are entered into by CSC Holdings and are thus attributable to the Restricted Group; all such contracts are carried at their current fair market values on our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2004, the notional value of all such contracts was $450 million and the fair value of these derivative contracts was $4.1 million, a net liability position. For the year ended 79 December 31, 2004, we recorded a net gain on interest swap contracts of $2.0 million, as detailed in the table below: Fair Market Value of Interest Rate Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2004, a net liability position $ (4,051 ) Less: fair market value as of December 31, 2003 (349 ) Change in fair market value, net (3,702 ) Plus: realized gain from cash interest income 5,751 Net gain on interest rate swap contracts $ 2,049 We have also entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of AT&T, Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog and 1.0 million shares of our Adelphia Communications common stock. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. In the event of an early termination of any of these contracts, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The following table details our estimated early termination exposure as of December 31, 2004: AT&T Comcast Charter General Electric Adelphia Total* (dollars in thousands) Collateralized indebtedness (carrying value) $ (311,211 ) $ (502,158 ) $ (251,814 ) $ (314,029 ) $ (39,935 ) $ (1,419,147 ) Collateralized indebtedness (fair value estimate) (321,294 ) (515,951 ) (256,782 ) (314,166 ) (39,935 ) (1,448,128 ) Derivative contract 151,582 63,062 214,723 (112,513 ) 38,678 355,532 Investment securities pledged as collateral 168,723 476,517 25,028 465,084 389 1,135,741 Net excess (shortfall) (989 ) 23,628 (17,031 ) 38,405 (868 ) 43,145 Value of prepaid swaps with cross termination rights (6,472 ) (10,930 ) (17,402 ) Net excess (shortfall) including prepaid swaps $ (7,461 ) $ 12,698 $ (17,031 ) $ 38,405 $ (868 ) $ 25,743 *Excludes Leapfrog monetization contract which is not expected to generate a shortfall due to the prepayment of interest and the AT&T Wireless contracts that were terminated in October 2004. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of General Electric, Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, AT&T, Comcast, or Leapfrog stock (as the case may be), with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. See "Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in the General Electric, Adelphia Communications and Charter 80 Communications transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing interest expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of our equity derivative contracts was $371.9 million, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net loss on all outstanding equity derivative contracts of $132.9 million attributable to changes in market conditions during the period, primarily driven by higher stock prices of several of the underlying securities, as well as the termination of the AT&T Wireless equity derivative contracts. We also recorded a gain on our holdings of the underlying stocks of $135.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as shown in the following table: Fair Market Value of Equity Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2003 $ 524,895 Change in fair market value, net (132,940 ) Redemption of contracts (20,099 ) Fair market value as of December 31, 2004 $ 371,856 Gain on underlying stock positions due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net $ 135,649 In 2001, in connection with certain monetization contracts, CSC Holdings entered into prepaid interest rate swaps with a notional contract value of $1,115.0 million. These contracts require CSC Holdings to pay floating rates of interest in exchange for receipt of fixed rate payments, the net present value of which was paid to CSC Holdings at the inception of the transaction in a total cash amount of $239.3 million. These swaps have maturities in 2005 and 2006 that coincide with the related prepaid equity forward maturities. Certain contracts provide for early termination of the prepaid interest rate swap in the event of an early termination of the related prepaid equity forward. All of our prepaid interest rate swaps are carried at their current fair market values on our consolidated balance sheet with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statement of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value of our prepaid interest rate derivative contracts was $47.3 million, a net liability position. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded a net loss on such derivative contracts of $2.7 million as detailed below: Fair Market Value of Prepaid Interest Rate Derivative Contracts (dollars in thousands) Fair market value as of December 31, 2004 $ (47,314 ) Less: fair market value at December 31, 2003 (65,753 ) Change in fair market value, net 18,439 Plus: realized loss resulting from net cash payments (21,145 ) Net loss on prepaid interest rate swap contracts $ (2,706 ) In connection with the issuance of the Series A preferred stock to Quadrangle, CSC Holdings entered into an agreement with Quadrangle which granted Quadrangle the right to require CSC Holdings to purchase the preferred stock ("put option") for cash or through the issuance of registered equity securities of Cablevision, at CSC Holdings option. The exchange right and the put option had been accounted for as a derivative. In October 2003, Quadrangle exercised its put option to require 81 CSC Holdings to purchase all of its Series A preferred stock. The parties entered into an agreement that the put price was $150.3 million. The put price was paid in cash by CSC Holdings in August 2004. The change in the fair value of the exchange right and put option of $31.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 has been reflected as a loss on derivative contracts in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Related Party Transactions We hold a 49.9% voting interest and certain preferential distribution rights in Northcoast Communications. Northcoast Communications is controlled by John Dolan, a nephew of Charles F. Dolan and a cousin of James L. Dolan, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, respectively. The operations of Northcoast Communications were not consolidated with those of the Company at December 31, 2003, however, pursuant to FIN 46R, Northcoast Communications was consolidated beginning March 31, 2004. In May 2003, Northcoast Communications completed its sale of PCS licenses to Verizon Wireless for approximately $763.0 million in cash. Of the proceeds, approximately $51.0 million was used by Northcoast Communications to retire debt. The remaining proceeds, after payment of expenses, were distributed to the partners of Northcoast Communications, including the Company. Our share of the proceeds was approximately $651.0 million. All of the funds we received were used to repay bank debt under our Restricted Group credit facility. Vendor financing for Northcoast Communications Cleveland operation consisted of a $75 million credit facility at its Cleveland PCS, LLC subsidiary. This facility had no recourse to us or to Northcoast Communications, other than pursuant to a pledge by Northcoast Communications of the stock of Cleveland PCS and a guarantee of the payment by Northcoast Communications and Cablevision of the FCC indebtedness of the Cleveland PCS subsidiary which held the Cleveland license. In March 2004, Northcoast Communications agreed to sell its Cleveland PCS business to an unaffiliated entity. The sale of Cleveland PCS was consummated in July 2004. As of December 31, 2004, both the FCC indebtedness and the obligations of Cleveland PCS under the vendor financing were satisfied. The Companys investment in Northcoast Communications was zero at December 31, 2004. Fox Sports Net Ohio and Cleveland Indians Baseball Club Limited Partnership (the "Indians") are parties to a multi year rights agreement under which Fox Sports Net Ohio pays license fees to the Indians in exchange for telecast rights to substantially all regular season Indians games. The Indians are owned by (i) Lawrence Dolan, a brother of Charles F. Dolan, the Companys Chairman, (ii) a trust, the beneficiaries of which are Lawrence Dolan and certain descendants of Lawrence Dolan, and (iii) certain other trusts, the beneficiaries of which are certain descendants of Charles F. Dolan, including James L. Dolan, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas C. Dolan and Patrick F. Dolan, officers of the Company and brothers of James L. Dolan and a trust whose discretionary beneficiaries include Brian Sweeney, son in law of Charles F. Dolan, brother in law of James L. Dolan and a director. Management control of the Indians is held by Lawrence Dolan. In February 2005, the Company signed a letter of intent under which VOOM HD, LLC, a new private company formed by certain holders of Cablevision Class B Common Stock, including Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan, would acquire from the Company the business, assets and liabilities of the Companys Rainbow DBS satellite business not included in the agreement with EchoStar. The letter of intent between the Company and VOOM HD expired on February 28, 2005 without a definitive agreement being reached. In March 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Charles F. Dolan and Thomas C. Dolan pursuant to which the parties agreed to work cooperatively to finalize the separation of Rainbow DBS from the Company. Cablevision has agreed that no new shutdown activities will be undertaken at 82 Rainbow DBS during the term of the agreement. Charles F. Dolan has agreed to fund any Rainbow DBS expenditures above those that would have been incurred under a shutdown scenario. Charles F. Dolan is required to fund those expenditures by providing to the Company cash or shares of the Companys common stock in advance of the Company making any expenditures above those contemplated in the shutdown budget. Similarly, if Rainbow DBS makes any new commitments or other agreements, the Company will segregate cash or shares received from Charles F. Dolan to pay the costs associated with those actions. In March 2005, Charles F. Dolan deposited $10 million with the Company in accordance with the agreement. The agreement will terminate on March 31, 2005. Charles F. Dolan has the right to terminate the agreement before that date. Upon any termination, any cash or shares deposited by Charles F. Dolan that have not been used to fund costs or segregated to pay costs associated with new commitments or other agreements will be returned to him and the shutdown of Rainbow DBS will be implemented immediately. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2004, the SEC staff issued Topic D 108, Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than Goodwill, which requires the direct method of separately valuing all intangible assets and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets. Topic D 108 requires the application of the direct value method to such assets acquired in business combinations completed after September 29, 2004. Further, for registrants who have applied the residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing, such registrants should perform an impairment test using a direct value method for all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2004. Impairments recognized upon application of Topic D 108 should be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. The Company currently uses the direct value method for purposes of impairment testing of its indefinite lived intangibles and therefore the adoption of Topic D 108 had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In September 2004, the EITF reached a consensus regarding Issue No. 04 1, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships Between the Parties to a Business Combination. EITF 04 1 requires an acquirer in a business combination to evaluate any preexisting relationship with the acquiree to determine if the business combination in effect contains a settlement of the preexisting relationship. A business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship should be viewed as a multiple element transaction. EITF 04 1 is effective for business combinations after October 13, 2004, but requires goodwill resulting from prior business combinations involving parties with a preexisting relationship to be tested for impairment by applying the guidance in the consensus in impairment tests performed after October 13, 2004. The application of the provisions of EITF 04 1 had no impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations in 2004.. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. Statement 153 addresses the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. Statement 153 eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. Previously, Opinion 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished. The Statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The provisions of Statement 153 will be adopted for all nonmonetary exchanges initiated after July 1, 2005 and therefore had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. 83 In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (Statement No. 123R). Statement No. 123R supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance and it establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. Statement No. 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Statement No. 123R is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company will be required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 123R beginning with its fiscal quarter commencing on July 1, 2005, and therefore the Statement had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company has not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect that the adoption will have on its financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the Comcast, AT&T, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog Enterprises and Adelphia Communications common stock held by us. We have entered into prepaid forward contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities other than 9.8 million shares of Adelphia Communications common stock. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. In the event of an early termination of any of these contracts, we would be obligated to repay the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. As of December 31, 2004, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast, AT&T, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog and Adelphia Communications common stock aggregated $1,150 million. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $115.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of these securities aggregated $371.9 million, a net receivable position. 84 The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via a prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: Cap Price (b) Security # of Shares Deliverable Hedge Price per Share (a) Maturity Low High Comcast 7,159,205 7,159,206 2005 2006 $ 35.90$38.47 $ 46.62 $ 63.91 AT&T 4,426,093 4,426,093 2005 2006 $ 34.39$42.08 $ 44.71 $ 61.21 Charter Communications (c) 1,862,229 5,586,687 3,724,460 2005 2006 2007 $ 22.35$22.92 $ 32.24 $ 38.33 General Electric 12,742,033 2006 $ 23.14$25.67 $ 27.76 $ 30.81 Adelphia Communications 1,010,000 2005 $ 39.04$40.04 $ 62.57 $ 63.57 Leapfrog 800,000 2007 $ 23.55$24.55 $ 29.87 $ 30.87 (a)Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. (b)Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. (c)On January 19, 2005, monetization contracts covering 1.9 million shares of the Companys Charter Communications stock matured. The Company settled its obligations under the related collateralized indebtedness by delivering an equivalent number of Charter Communications shares and the cash proceeds from the related equity derivative contract that had previously been pledged to the bank counterparty. In October 2004, the Company received $213.6 million in cash in exchange for all 14.2 million shares it owned of AT&T Wireless common stock, representing the $15 share price paid in consideration of the merger between AT&T Wireless and Cingular Wireless LLC. The shares and resultant cash exchanged for such shares had previously been pledged in support of the repayment of the collateralized debt. As a result of that exchange, the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to its shares of AT&T Wireless were terminated. The termination provisions under the prepaid forward contracts required the Company to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and equity collars. The Company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $6.1 million representing the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the collateralized indebtedness. At December 31, 2004, the Company had settled certain collateralized indebtedness with a fair value of $124.1 million by releasing to the counterparty cash proceeds from the related prepaid forward contract totaling $20.1 million and the cash from the merger transaction of $105.0 million both of which had been pledged in settlement of the debt. The Company received the net difference of $1.0 million in cash. The remaining collateralized indebtedness related to the AT&T Wireless shares was settled in February 2005 and accordingly, the balance sheet at December 31, 2004 reflects the redemption value of the collateralized indebtedness of $116.5 million, the fair value of the prepaid forward contracts of $8.9 million and restricted cash of $108.6 million. The Company received net cash proceeds of $1.0 million in February 2005 upon settlement of this obligation. 85 Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment. In addition, from time to time we may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2004, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $8,168.3 million exceeded the carrying value of $7,665.9 million by approximately $502.4 million. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR based market rates and thus approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2004 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $347.4 million to $8,515.7 million. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Derivative Contracts: As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of $450.0 million. As of December 31, 2004, the fair market value and carrying value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately $4.1 million, a net liability position, as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2004 prevailing levels would increase our liability under these contracts to $16.6 million. In addition, we had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of $1,115.0 million entered into in connection with our monetization transactions. As of December 31, 2004, such contracts had a fair market value and carrying value of $47.3 million, a net liability position, reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2004 prevailing levels would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately $9.9 million to a liability of $57.2 million.
