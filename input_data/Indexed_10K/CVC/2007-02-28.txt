Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. Telecommunications Services Our Telecommunications Services segment derives revenues principally through monthly charges to subscribers of our video, high speed data and voice services. These monthly charges include fees for cable television programming, as well as, in many cases, equipment rental, pay per view and video on demand, high speed data and voice services. Revenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers to these services, upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe, and additional services sold to our existing subscribers. We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems. Revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems. Because 59% of our basic video customers are already subscribers to our high speed data services, our ability to grow our high speed data services may be limited. Programming costs are the most significant part of our operating expenses and are expected to increase as a result of digital subscriber growth, additional service offerings and contractual rate increases. Our cable television video services, which accounted for 46% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, face competition from the direct broadcast satellite business and the delivery systems of incumbent telephone companies. There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have. We compete with these DBS competitors by bundling our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high speed data service and voice service carried over the cable distribution plant, as well as by providing interactive and on demand services that are currently unavailable to a DBS subscriber, such as video on demand. As discussed in greater detail below, we face intense competition from incumbent telephone companies such as Verizon and AT&T, which have recently begun to offer video programming in addition to their voice and high speed Internet access services, evidencing their commitment to compete across all of the Companys telecommunications products. Their competitive position has been improved by recent operational, regulatory and legislative advances that they have made. Historically, we have made substantial investments in the development of new and innovative programming options for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors. We likely will continue to do so in order to be a more effective competitor. Our high speed data services business, which accounted for 15% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, faces competition from DSL providers, including Verizon and AT&T, and wireless Internet providers. These providers have become increasingly aggressive in their pricing strategies in recent years, and customers may decide that a reduced price is more important to them than the superior speed that cable modems provide. As discussed in greater detail below, another source of competition is incumbent telephone companies such as Verizon and AT&T. This competition, together with our already high penetration, is expected to slow our growth in cable modem penetration from the growth rates we have experienced in the past. 44 Our consumer voice offering, which accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited United States, Canada and Puerto Rico long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price. To the extent the incumbents, who have financial resources that exceed those of the Company, decide to meet our pricing and or features or reduce their pricing, future growth and success of this business may be impaired. The regulatory framework for cable modem service and voice service is being developed and changes in how we are regulated, including increased regulation, may affect our competitive position. The telephone companies continue constructing systems designed to provide video programming as well as voice and data services to residential customers in our service area. AT&T has announced plans to begin offering video services in our service area in Connecticut, where it is currently permitted to offer such service without any state authorization. Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our service area, though currently less than a quarter of the households according to our estimates. Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service (it already has or needs no authority to provide phone and data services) for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey and through numerous local franchises in New York. Verizon has so far not indicated any plans to offer video service in Connecticut. See Item 1. Business Regulation for a discussion of regulatory and legislative issues and Item 1A. Risk Factors Pending FCC, Congressional and judicial proceedings may affect our businesses. Optimum Lightpath, our commercial voice and commercial broadband business, which accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies incumbent local exchange companies such as Verizon and AT&T, other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies. To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of our Optimum Lightpath may be impaired. The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless, data medium. Should this trend accelerate dramatically, future growth of Optimum Lightpath may be negatively impacted. Rainbow In our Rainbow segment, which accounted for 15% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, we earn revenues in two principal ways. First, we receive affiliate fee payments principally from cable television systems and DBS operators. These revenues are generally on a per subscriber basis and earned under multi year contracts with those operators referred to as affiliation agreements. The specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks but are generally based upon the number of each operators subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers. The second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising. Under our agreements with cable television system and DBS operators, we have the right to sell a specific amount of national advertising time on our programming networks. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis, not under long term contracts. Also, our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services. We seek to grow our revenues in the Rainbow segment by increasing the number of distributors that carry our services and the number of viewing subscribers. We refer to this as our penetration. AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than our newer, less penetrated services. Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements. In negotiating for increased or extended carriage, we may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers or extended carriage, which we record as 45 deferred carriage fees and which are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related subscriber guarantee, or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees (deferred carriage), discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period. We seek to increase our advertising revenues by increasing the number of minutes of national advertising and by increasing rates for such advertising, but, ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services, and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services. The principal goals in this segment are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our national services. To do this we must continue to contract for and produce high quality, attractive programming. Our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television systems and DBS operators because of the disparate bargaining power between us and the largest cable television systems and DBS operators. This increased concentration could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration. In addition, this concentration gives those operators greater leverage in negotiating the price and other terms of affiliation agreements. Moreover, as a result of this concentration, the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliates would have a significant impact on this segment. Madison Square Garden Madison Square Garden which accounted for 14% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, consists of professional sports teams (principally the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), along with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League and the New York Liberty of the Womens National Basketball Association), the MSG Networks sports programming business, and an entertainment business. It also operates the Madison Square Garden Arena, Radio City Music Hall, the Hartford Civic Center and Rentschler Field (sports and entertainment venues in Connecticut), and effective January 1, 2007, the Beacon Theater in New York City. Madison Square Garden faces competitive challenges unique to these activities. We derive revenues in this segment primarily from the MSG Networks (see below), the sale of tickets, including luxury box rentals, to sporting and entertainment events, from rental rights fees paid to this segment by promoters that present events at our entertainment venues and the sports teams share of league wide distributions of national television rights fees and royalties. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at our owned and operated venues, from food, beverage and merchandise sales at these venues and from the licensing of our trademarks. MSG Networks derives its revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television providers (including our cable television systems), satellite providers that provide video service and sales of advertising. This segments financial performance is related to the performance of all the teams presented and the attractiveness of its entertainment events. Our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales, paid attendance, luxury box rentals, and food, beverage and merchandise sales. To a large extent, the ability of the teams to build excitement among fans, and therefore produce higher revenue streams, depends on the teams winning performance, which generates regular season and playoff attendance and luxury box rentals, and which also supports increases in prices charged for tickets, luxury box rentals, and advertising placement. Each teams success is dependent on its ability to acquire highly competitive personnel. The governing bodies of the NBA and the NHL have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective leagues, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing our professional sports teams results of operations. 46 MSG Networks sports programming business is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of professional sports teams, in addition to our proprietary programming. The continued carriage and success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising, as well as the ability to attract advertisers. In the second quarter of 2004, the New York Mets gave notice of termination of its broadcast rights agreement with MSG Networks. The termination of the rights agreement was effective after the end of the 2005 baseball season. Although the termination of the rights agreement had a negative impact on Madison Square Gardens revenue, it did not have a significant impact on Madison Square Gardens results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. Madison Square Gardens entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our Radio City Christmas Spectacular and our touring Christmas shows, as well as the availability of, and our venues ability to attract concerts, family shows and events. The dependence of this segments revenues on its sports teams and Christmas shows generally make it seasonal with a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income being derived in the fourth quarter of each year. Stock Option Related Matters We incurred substantial expenses in 2006 for legal, accounting, tax and other professional services in connection with the Companys voluntary review of past practices in connection with grants of stock options and SARs, the preparation of restated financial statements, stock option related litigation, and the investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with these matters. Refer to Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets: The Companys long lived and indefinite lived assets at December 31, 2006 include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) of approximately $1,032,117, approximately $1,510,034 of other intangible assets ($893,879 of which are indefinite lived intangibles) and approximately $3,714,842 of property, plant and equipment. Such assets accounted for approximately 64% of the Companys consolidated total assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment 47 loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For other long lived assets, including intangibles that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other long lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. For the Telecommunications Services segment, these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of homes passed, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed, among other assumptions. For the Madison Square Garden and Rainbow segments, these valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers, number of events (MSG segment only), access to sports programming and film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell through rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Companys reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite lived intangibles, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the Companys reporting units. Rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun, unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability, then when the uncertainty is resolved. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight line basis over the respective license periods. We periodically review the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service. If we determine that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, we would record a write off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films. In 2004, the Company recorded impairment losses totaling $354,812 related to its decision to seek strategic alternatives for the Rainbow DBS segment of its operations. The Company recorded impairment charges of $90,540 included in depreciation and amortization expense relating to long lived assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets and $75,805 included in technical and operating expenses representing the write down of certain film and programming contracts relating to its VOOM HD Networks programming service. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment charge relating to the Rainbow DBS satellite distribution business of $155,415 reflecting the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of long lived assets and goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and a charge of approximately $33,052 representing the write off of equipment inventory and deposits which 48 have been recorded in discontinued operations. In addition to the Rainbow DBS segment impairment losses, we recorded impairment losses of approximately $1,640, $663 and $297 in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, included in technical and operating expense, representing the impairment of certain film and programming contracts and $2,104 and $7,697 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, included in depreciation and amortization related to certain other long lived assets and intangibles primarily within our theater operations and PVI Virtual Media business in 2006 and within our theater operations and Rainbow segment in 2005. Useful Lives of Finite Lived Intangible Assets: The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation relationships, affiliation agreements, advertiser relationships, season ticket holder relationships and suite holder contracts and relationships as a result of the Regional Programming Partners restructuring transaction with News Corporation in April 2005. In addition, the Company has also recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the July 2003 repurchase of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, Inc.s (MGM) 20% interest in each of American Movie Classics Company LLC, WE: Womens Entertainment and The Independent Film Channel LLC and the repurchase of NBCs interests in Rainbow Media Holdings in various transactions in 2001 and 2002. The Company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated those lives to be 4 to 11 years for affiliation agreements, 24 years for affiliation relationships, 7 to 10 years for advertiser relationships, 10 to 15 years for season ticket holder relationships and 3 to 11 years for suite holder contracts and relationships. At December 31, 2006, the carrying values, net of accumulated amortization, were $416,886 for affiliation agreements and affiliation relationships, $36,002 for broadcast rights and other agreements, $61,257 for advertiser relationships, $64,978 for season ticket holder relationships, $15,352 for suite holder contracts and relationships and $21,680 for other intangibles. The amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements and affiliation relationships finite lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements, affiliation relationships and the related customer relationships. The useful lives for the affiliation agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 4 to 11 years for affiliation agreements and 24 years for affiliation relationships is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible asset. There have been periods when an existing affiliate agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewal. In one case during 2004, there was a 10 day period in which an affiliate was restricted from carrying certain of the Companys sports and entertainment networks because the parties had not reached agreement on contract renewal terms. We reached a short term agreement with the affiliate at the end of the 10 day period and that affiliate continuously carried the networks pursuant to successive subsequent short term agreements through March 7, 2005. However, we were unable to reach an agreement with this affiliate at expiration on March 7, 2005, and this affiliate discontinued carriage of certain of the Companys sports networks. On May 9, 2005, we reached a multi year agreement on key rate and positioning terms for carriage of these sports networks and the parties subsequently entered into definitive documentation 49 reflecting such agreement. See Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets discussion above. If an affiliate were to cease carrying the service on an other than temporary basis, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliate agreement intangible asset. If the Company were to renew an affiliate agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets for the asset group containing that intangible. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliate agreement remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2006 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliate agreements and affiliation relationships were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization in the year ending December 31, 2007 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $6,683. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys future deductible temporary differences and NOLs. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state net operating loss carry forwards. In 2006, the Company recorded a decrease in the valuation allowance of $10,404 relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards. In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded increases in the valuation allowance of $6,459 and $14,036, respectively, relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards. During 2006 and 2005, certain state net operating loss carry forwards expired prior to utilization. The deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired net operating loss carry forwards had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $2,638 and $6,953 in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Companys cable television system, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Companys hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant and headend facilities. Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance and call completion fees, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to connect businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the infrastructure or digital platform are also capitalized. These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor to connect, provision and provide on site and remote technical assistance and other related costs associated with the connection activities. In addition, on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental 50 costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. New connections are amortized over 5 years or 12 years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home, respectively. The portion of departmental costs related to reconnection, programming service up and down grade, repair and maintenance, and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred. Defined Benefit Pension Plans: The Company sponsors both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in various forms covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements. The Companys company wide plans include a non contributory cash balance retirement plan, an unfunded non qualified excess cash balance plan and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan (collectively, the Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans). In addition, Madison Square Garden sponsors a non contributory pension plan covering its non union employees (hired prior to January 1, 2001), an unfunded non qualified defined benefit pension plan and two non contributory pension plans covering certain of its union employees (collectively, the Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans). The Company utilizes actuarial methods required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (Statement No. 87), in calculating the liability and expense related to these plans. These actuarial methods require numerous assumptions in an attempt to estimate future events, including the discount rate, expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases, as determined annually by the Company. Material changes in the pension costs of the plans may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions, changes in the number of the plan participants, changes in the level of benefits provided, changes in asset levels and changes in legislation. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and managements best judgment regarding future expectations. Since liabilities under defined benefit plans are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate is a significant assumption. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high quality, long term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the plans, we refer to applicable bond yields (such as Moodys Aaa Corporate Bonds) and the Buck Consultants Discount Rate Model (which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds), to select a rate at which we believe the plans benefits could be effectively settled. Based on the published rates and the results from the Buck Consultants Discount Rate Model as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we used the following weighted average discount rates for the Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans and the Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans: Weighted Average Discount Rate Used to Calculate the Benefit Obligation at December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans 5.80 % 5.80 % Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans 6.14 % 5.75 % For the year ended December 31, 2006, these discount rates had an aggregate effect of decreasing the Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Plans benefit obligation by approximately 51 $6,797. There was no effect on the benefit obligation for the Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans. The expected long term return on plan assets is based on a periodic review and modeling of the plans asset allocation structure over a long term horizon. Expectations of returns for each asset class are the most important of the assumptions used in the review and modeling and are based on comprehensive reviews of historical data and economic/financial market theory. The expected long term rate of return was selected from within the reasonable range of rates determined by (a) historical real returns, net of inflation, for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, and (b) projections of inflation over the long term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. The expected rate of return for the Cablevision Qualified and the Madison Square Garden Qualified Defined Benefit Plans was 8.00% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following table reflects the Companys estimates of the possible effects of changes in the discount rates and expected rates of return on its 2007 net periodic benefit cost and its benefit obligation at December 31, 2006 for the Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans and the Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans: Discount Rate 25 Basis Points Increase 25 Basis Points Decrease Increase (Decrease) in Net Periodic Benefit Cost Projected Benefit Obligation Net Periodic Benefit Cost Projected Benefit Obligation Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans $ (223 ) $ (2,701 ) $ 418 $ 2,890 Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans (517 ) (4,362 ) 578 4,856 Expected Rate of Return Increase (Decrease) in Net Periodic Benefit Cost 25 Basis Points Increase 25 Basis Points Decrease Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans (309 ) 309 Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans (131 ) 131 Generally accepted accounting principles include mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in our earnings which otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur. For example, while the expected long term rate of return on the Plans assets should, over time, approximate the actual long term returns, differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year. These differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses, which are then amortized over time. 52 The rate of future compensation increases is another assumption used by the Companys third party actuary. The weighted average rate of future compensation increases used in 2006 and in 2005 for the Cablevision Qualified Defined Benefit and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans and the Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans are as follows: Net Periodic Benefit Cost Benefit Obligation 2006 2005 2006 2005 Cablevision Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans 4.15 % 4.12 % 4.40 % 4.15 % Madison Square Garden Qualified and Non qualified Defined Benefit Plans 4.00 % 3.16 % 4.39 % 4.00 % In addition, the Companys actuary also uses other assumptions such as termination and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used by the Company may differ materially from actual results due to changing economic and market conditions, higher or lower benefit payments or longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other things. Differences between actual and expected occurrences could significantly impact the actual amount of net periodic cost and the benefit obligation recorded by the Company. Certain Transactions The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2005 Transactions. In April 2005, the Company and News Corporation restructured Regional Programming Partners. As a result, the Company now owns 100% of Madison Square Garden and no longer owns interests in Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Florida, National Sports Partners or National Advertising Partners. The Company also owns 100% of Fox Sports Net Chicago, which was shut down in June 2006, as well as 50% of Fox Sports Net New England and continues to own 60% of Fox Sports Net Bay Area. In April 2005, subsidiaries of the Company entered into agreements with EchoStar relating to the launch and operation of the business of Rainbow HD Holdings, the Companys VOOM HD Networks high definition television programming service, subject to the closing of the sale of our satellite (Rainbow 1) to EchoStar which occurred in November 2005. Under those arrangements, EchoStar was initially distributed a portion of the VOOM HD Networks programming service and, beginning in 2006 began carrying all 15 of the channels included in the programming service. In connection with the arrangements, EchoStar was issued a 20% interest in Rainbow HD Holdings, the Companys subsidiary owning the VOOM HD Networks, and that 20% interest will not be diluted until $500,000 in cash has been invested in Rainbow HD Holdings equity by the Company. Under the terms of the affiliation arrangements with EchoStar covering the VOOM HD Networks for a 15 year term, if Rainbow HD Holdings fails to spend $100,000 per year, up to a maximum of $500,000 in the aggregate, on its service offerings, EchoStar may terminate the affiliation agreement. The Company has the right to terminate the affiliation agreement if the VOOM HD Networks are discontinued in the future. 2004 Transactions. In 2004, Rainbow DBS invested approximately $84,600 in exchange for a substantial interest in an entity that had acquired licenses from the FCC to provide multichannel video distribution and data service in 46 metropolitan areas in the United States. 53 In July 2004, Northcoast Communications, a 49.9% owned subsidiary of the Company, completed its sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cleveland PCS, to an unaffiliated entity. The Company did not record any gain or loss in connection with the sale.

The Company allocates certain costs to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services. The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect intersegment eliminations unless specifically indicated. See Business Segments Results for a more detailed discussion relating to the operating results of our segments. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $754,984 (15%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunication Services segment $ 630,942 Increase in revenues of the Rainbow segment 60,425 Increase in revenues of the Madison Square Garden segment 49,645 Other net decreases (994 ) Intersegment eliminations 14,966 $ 754,984 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) include primarily: cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis; network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections; contractual rights payments to broadcast certain live sporting events and contractual payments pursuant to employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel; amortization of costs to license programming, including feature films, and programming and production costs of our Rainbow businesses; and interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers. 56 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) in 2006 increased $411,062 (18%) as compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 269,941 Increase in expenses of the Rainbow segment 37,128 Increase in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment 87,793 Other net increases 596 Intersegment eliminations 15,604 $ 411,062 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 2% during 2006 as compared to 2005. This increased percentage is primarily attributable to increases in technical and operating expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment and to a lesser extent the Rainbow segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $188,342 (15%) for 2006 as compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 129,474 Increase in expenses of the Rainbow segment 39,851 Increase in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment 20,292 Other net decreases (578 ) Intersegment eliminations (697 ) $ 188,342 On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (Statement No. 123R). Statement No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions, as the Company formerly did, using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally requires that share based payments be accounted for using a fair value based method. As a result of the adoption of Statement No. 123R, the Companys stock plan expense for 2006 for all segments has increased as compared to 2005. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2006 compared to 2005. Restructuring credits amounted to $3,484 in 2006 and $537 in 2005. The 2006 amount related primarily to adjustments to facility realignment provisions recorded in connection with the 2001 and 2002 restructuring plans of $3,996, partially offset by a charge of $512 relating to facility realignment and severance costs associated with the 2006 restructuring plans. The 2005 amount is comprised of a $2,060 credit resulting from changes in estimates of facility realignment costs relating to the 2001 and 2002 restructuring plans, partially offset by $1,025 of severance costs in 2005 and $498 of additional provisions for severance costs associated with the 2004 and 2003 restructuring plans. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) increased $45,170 (4%) for 2006 as compared to 2005. The net increase consisted of an increase in depreciation expense of $53,571 primarily from depreciation of new fixed assets in our telecommunication services segment, partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $8,401 primarily resulting from an impairment of certain intangibles recorded in 2005 attributable to the shutdown of two of three MetroChannels and a net decrease of $741 relating to the impairment of certain long lived assets within our theater operations. 57 Net interest expense increased $142,937 (19%) during 2006 compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase due to higher average debt balances related primarily to the financing of the special dividend on March 29, 2006, partially offset by lower outstanding collateralized indebtedness and the redemption of certain senior subordinated debentures $ 118,328 Increase due to higher average interest rates 48,990 Higher interest income (20,757 ) Other net decreases (3,624 ) $ 142,937 Equity in net income of affiliates amounted to $6,698 in 2006 compared to $3,219 in 2005. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company does not have a majority ownership interest. Gain on sale of affiliate interests of $64,968 for the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from the Company and News Corporation restructuring their ownership of National Sports Partners and National Advertising Partners. Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 of $290,052 and $(138,312) respectively, consists primarily of the net increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast, General Electric, AT&T, Charter Communications, Leapfrog, and Adelphia Communications common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains and losses are largely offset by the losses and gains on related derivative contracts described below. Write off of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $14,083 includes $6,084 of costs written off in connection with the refinancing of the Rainbow National Services LLC credit agreement in July 2006, $3,412 of costs written off in connection with the early redemption of CSC Holdings $250,000 principal amount of 10 1/2% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2016 in May 2006, and $4,587 of costs written off in connection with the refinancing of the CSC Holdings credit agreement. Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Unrealized and realized gain (loss) due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog and Adelphia Communications shares $ (214,352 ) $ 135,677 Unrealized and realized losses on interest rate swap contracts (39,360 ) (16,497 ) $ (253,712 ) $ 119,180 The effects of these gains and losses are largely offset by the losses and gains on investment securities pledged as collateral which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $13,125 for the year ended December 31, 2006 represents the premium paid on the early redemption of CSC Holdings $250,000 principal amount of 10 1/2% Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2016 in May 2006. 58 Minority interests represent other parties share of the net income (losses) of entities which are not entirely owned by us but which are consolidated in our financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 minority interests consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 News Corporations 40% share of the net income of Fox Sports Net Bay Area $ (7,228 ) $ (6,896 ) News Corporations 40% share of the net loss of Regional Programming Partners 2,123 Other (1,666 ) (698 ) $ (8,894 ) $ (5,471 ) Net miscellaneous income of $2,837 and $651 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, resulted primarily from dividends received on certain of the Companys investment securities, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $134,217 for the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from the Companys pretax loss, state income tax benefit of $24,315, increased by a $10,404 decrease in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards, a tax benefit of $16,356 resulting from the reduction in a tax contingency liability pursuant to a change in judgment, a tax benefit of $5,013 resulting from the favorable settlement of an issue with a taxing authority, partially offset by the impact of non deductible officers compensation of $4,443 and other non deducible expenses of $6,768. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $75,691 for the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, state income tax benefit of $12,211, increased by a tax benefit of $6,701 resulting from an adjustment to a state tax rate, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $6,459 relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards and the impact of non deductible officers compensation of $6,226 and other non deducible expenses of $10,637. The Company is currently being audited by the state of Ohio for the tax year ended December 31, 2000. The primary audit issue is the amount of gain that should be subject to tax in Ohio pursuant to the 2000 sale of certain cable television systems. Ohio has asserted that more of the gain should be taxed in Ohio. Ohio has issued a proposed assessment of additional tax due of approximately $55,000 plus interest of approximately $12,000. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded a liability with respect to such matter of approximately $11,000, including interest, which represents managements current estimate of the additional amount that may be owed. Income (loss) from discontinued operations In April 2005, the operations of the Rainbow DBS satellite distribution business were shut down. In connection with the shut down, certain assets of the business, including the Rainbow 1 direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets were sold to a subsidiary of EchoStar for $200,000 in cash. This transaction closed in November 2005. In September 2005, Loral Space & Communications Holding Corporation (Loral) filed an action against Cablevision and Rainbow DBS Holdings, Inc. (Rainbow DBS) for breach of contract based on a letter agreement dated March 23, 2001 (the Letter Agreement) between Loral and Rainbow DBS. Loral alleges that the sale of the Rainbow 1 satellite and related assets to EchoStar constituted a sale of substantially all of the assets of Rainbow DBS triggering a Make Whole Payment under the Letter Agreement of $33,000 plus interest. A trial in this matter took place in January 2007 in New York Supreme Court for New York County. On January 24, 2007, the jury returned a verdict finding that the EchoStar sale had triggered a Make Whole Payment under the Letter 59 Agreement, requiring a payment to Loral of $50,898, including interest, which has been accrued for as of December 31, 2006 and reflected as an expense in discontinued operations. Cablevision and Rainbow DBS have filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative for a new trial, which is pending. In April 2005, the Company and News Corporation restructured Regional Programming Partners. As a result, the Company now owns 100% of Madison Square Garden, 50% of Fox Sports Net New England and continues to own 60% of Fox Sports Net Bay Area and no longer owns interests in Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Florida, National Sports Partners or National Advertising Partners. The Company also owned 100% of Fox Sports Net Chicago which was shut down in June 2006. The operating results of the Fox Sports Net Chicago, Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida businesses and those of the Rainbow DBS distribution business, which was shut down in April 2005, have been reported in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 reflects the following items, net of related income taxes and minority interests: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 Net operating results of the Rainbow DBS distribution business, including shutdown costs, net of taxes* $(33,472 ) $(60,832 ) Net operating results of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida, net of taxes 6,652 Gain on sale of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida, net of taxes 266,810 Net operating results of Fox Sports Net Chicago, net of taxes** 40,955 1,620 Other, net of taxes (37 ) 2,603 $7,446 $216,853 * The 2006 amount includes $30,025, net of taxes, representing the Make Whole Payment due to Loral. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. ** The 2006 amount includes approximately $46,100, net of taxes, representing the collection in June 2006 of affiliate revenue from a cable affiliate, including approximately $42,200, net of taxes, relating to periods prior to 2006, that had not been previously recognized due to a contractual dispute. The underlying contract was terminated in June 2006 and no further payments will be received under this contract. 60 Business Segments Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenue for the Companys Telecommunications Services segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) in Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Operating Income Revenues, net $ 4,237,707 100 % $ 3,606,765 100 % $ 630,942 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 1,774,607 42 1,504,666 42 (269,941 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 834,031 20 704,557 20 (129,474 ) Restructuring charges (credits) (17 ) 295 312 Depreciation and amortization 915,724 22 843,177 23 (72,547 ) Operating income $ 713,362 17 % $ 554,070 15 % $ 159,292 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $630,942 (17%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The following table presents the increases by major components of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 for the Companys Telecommunications Services segment: As of December 31, Percent 2006 2005 Increase Increase Video (including analog, digital, pay per view, video on demand and digital video recorder) $ 2,576,598 $ 2,309,293 $ 267,305 12 % High speed data 900,024 761,775 138,249 18 % Voice 369,793 171,701 198,092 115 % Advertising 119,239 110,033 9,206 8 % Other (including installation, home shopping, advertising sales commissions, and other products) 109,781 98,093 11,688 12 % Total cable television 4,075,435 3,450,895 624,540 18 % Optimum Lightpath 210,594 195,486 15,108 8 % Intra segment eliminations (48,322 ) (39,616 ) (8,706 ) (22 )% Total Telecommunications Services $ 4,237,707 $ 3,606,765 $ 630,942 17 % Revenue increases reflected above are primarily derived from increases in the number of subscribers to these services (set forth in the table below), upgrades by video customers from the level of the programming package to which they subscribe, additional services sold to our existing subscribers and general increases in rates, offset in part by offer discounts and other rate changes. As a result, our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the fourth quarter of December 2006 was $115.30 as compared with $100.46 for the fourth quarter of December 2005. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services and Optimum Voice call completion activity, partially offset by a decline in traditional circuit switched services. The following table presents certain subscriber information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 for the Companys cable television systems (excluding Lightpath): 61 As of December 31, Increase Percent Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) (Decrease) Basic video customers 3,127,000 3,027,000 100,000 3 % iO digital video customers 2,447,000 1,963,000 484,000 25 % Optimum Online high speed data customers 2,039,000 1,694,000 345,000 20 % Optimum voice customers 1,209,000 731,000 478,000 65 % Residential telephone customers 5,000 8,000 (3,000 ) (33 )% Total revenue generating units 8,827,000 7,423,000 1,404,000 19 % The Company added basic video customers and revenue generating units ("RGUs") in each quarter of 2006 aggregating approximately 100,000 and 1,404,000, respectively, for the year. However, fewer basic video customers and RGUs were added during the fourth quarter of 2006 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Because of our relatively high digital video penetration rates and, to a lesser extent, the increasing competition in our service territory, we expect our basic video customer and RGU growth in 2007 to be lower than what we experienced in 2006. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for 2006 increased $269,941 (18%) compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) due primarily to subscriber growth, expanded service offerings, and programming rate increases $ 164,162 Increase in field service and network related costs primarily due to growth in revenue generating units 57,205 Increase in call completion and interconnection costs related to the VoIP business due primarily to subscriber growth and the costs of our flat rate international service offering beginning in the second quarter of 2006 48,996 Resolution of a contractual programming dispute* (26,476 ) Increase in VoIP related taxes and surcharges due primarily to subscriber growth, partially offset by favorable tax settlements 12,033 Other net increases 23,915 Intra segment eliminations (9,894 ) $ 269,941 * Represents the collection of $26,500 in June 2006 related to the resolution of a contractual programming dispute, $19,476 of which was due in periods prior to 2006 but not recognized as a reduction to programming costs because it was being disputed and was not being paid by the affiliate. The underlying contract was terminated in June 2006 and no further payments will be received under the contract. Payments received under the contract are accounted for as a reduction to programming costs. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained constant, during 2006 as compared to 2005. 62 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $129,474 (18%) for 2006 as compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in customer related costs (principally call center related costs) primarily due to increased revenue generating units $ 42,005 Increase in sales and marketing costs 41,666 Increase in share based compensation expenses (includes the effects of adopting Statement No. 123R effective January 1, 2006) 24,828 Other general and administrative cost increases 11,400 Increase in expenses relating to a long term incentive plan 8,387 Intra segment eliminations 1,188 $ 129,474 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2006 as compared to 2005. Restructuring charges amounted to $295 in 2005. This amount is comprised primarily of $894 of severance costs associated with the 2005 restructuring plans and $263 of additional provisions for severance associated with the 2004 restructuring plans, partially offset by a credit of $896 resulting from changes in estimates of facility realignment costs relating to the 2002 restructuring plans. Depreciation and amortization increased $72,547 (9%) for 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation of new fixed assets, primarily subscriber devices. Rainbow The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues for the Companys Rainbow segment: Increase Years Ended December 31, (Decrease) 2006 2005 in % of Net % of Net Operating Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Income Revenues, net $885,986 100 % $825,561 100 % $60,425 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) 382,695 43 345,567 42 (37,128 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 367,845 42 327,994 40 (39,851 ) Restructuring charges 143 (143 ) Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 106,556 12 113,429 14 6,873 Operating income $28,747 3 % $38,571 5 % $(9,824 ) Included in the Rainbow segments results of operations is operating income from AMC, IFC and WE tv aggregating $197,294 and $185,703, and operating losses from Rainbows other programming services aggregating $168,547 and $147,132 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These other programming services consist of Fox Sports Net Bay Area, fuse, Mag Rack, sportskool, News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures. The operating loss was attributable primarily to VOOM HD Networks, as well as the News 12 Networks and fuse, which more than offset 63 operating income generated by Fox Sports Net Bay Area. The VOOM HD Networks business has been incurring substantial operating losses and these losses are expected to continue for at least the next several years. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $60,425 (7%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in advertising revenues at the AMC/IFC/WE tv businesses $ 34,762 Increase in affiliate and other revenue at Rainbows other programming businesses 20,150 Increase in advertising revenues at Rainbows other programming businesses 13,689 Increase in affiliate and other revenue at the AMC/IFC/WE tv businesses resulting from increases in programming network subscribers and rate changes. 9,809 Decrease attributable to the MetroChannel business which shut down two of its three channels in the second quarter of 2005 (17,985 ) $ 60,425 Advertising revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 and we expect this trend to continue. Revenue increases discussed above are primarily derived from increases in the level of advertising on our networks, increases in the number of subscribers to our programming services, and increases in fees charged for our services. The following table presents certain viewing subscriber information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: As of December 31, Percent 2006 2005 Increase Increase (in thousands) Viewing Subscribers: AMC 81,100 77,200 3,900 5.1 % WE tv 52,700 50,900 1,800 3.5 % IFC 40,100 37,300 2,800 7.5 % fuse 42,000 35,500 6,500 18.3 % VOOM HD Networks 300 25 275 Fox Sports Net Bay Area 3,700 3,600 100 2.8 % Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $37,128 (11%) compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Net increase resulting from higher programming and contractual costs at the other Rainbow businesses, including the VOOM HD Networks $ 31,861 Net increase in programming costs at the AMC/IFC/WE tv businesses which resulted primarily from increased series development/original programming costs 9,240 Decrease resulting from the MetroChannel business, which shut down two of its three channels in the second quarter of 2005 (3,973 ) $ 37,128 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating increased 1% during 2006 as compared to 2005 resulting primarily from higher programming costs associated with the VOOM HD Networks. 64 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39,851 (12%) for 2006 compared to 2005. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in share based compensation expenses (includes the effects of adopting Statement No. 123R effective January 1, 2006) $ 19,160 Increase in administrative costs, including corporate allocations 10,421 Increase in expenses relating to Cablevisions long term incentive plan 5,341 Net increase in selling, marketing and advertising costs primarily related to marketing and promotional activities 4,929 $ 39,851 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2% in 2006 compared to 2005. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) decreased $6,873 (6%) for 2006 as compared to 2005. The net decrease was comprised of approximately $4,963 resulting from the impairment of certain intangibles during the second quarter of 2005, a decrease of approximately $3,585 attributable to the MetroChannel business, which shut down two of its three channels in the second quarter of 2005, and a decrease of approximately $1,237 due to the transfer of certain intangibles to another operating segment in the second quarter of 2005. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately $2,912 resulting primarily from depreciation of new fixed assets. Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to net revenues for Madison Square Garden. Years Ended December 31 Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) in % of Net % of Net Operating Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Income Revenues, net $ 854,040 100 % $ 804,395 100 % $ 49,645 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 606,566 71 518,773 64 (87,793 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 189,310 22 169,018 21 (20,292 ) Restructuring charges 366 366 Depreciation and amortization 60,160 7 62,834 8 2,674 Operating income (loss) $ (1,996 ) % $ 53,404 7 % $ (55,400 ) The dependence of this segments revenues on its sports teams and Christmas shows generally make it seasonal with a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income being derived in the fourth quarter of each year. 65 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $49,645 (6%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. This net increase is attributable to the following: Return of National Hockey League games after the cancellation of 2004 2005 season $ 52,118 Higher other team related revenues 9,368 Lower advertising sales revenue and sublicense fees resulting from loss of Mets broadcast rights agreement (26,877 ) Retroactive MSG Networks affiliate rate adjustments recorded in 2005* (17,834 ) Net higher other MSG Networks affiliate fees (excluding the impact of the cancellation of the NHL 2004 2005 season and the 2005 retroactive affiliate rate adjustments noted above) including the impact of the loss of the Mets broadcast rights agreement 16,541 Net higher revenues from entertainment events 19,029 Other net decreases (2,700 ) $ 49,645 * The retroactive MSG Networks affiliate rate adjustments discussed above resulted from the signing of certain affiliate contracts in 2005 that increased rates for periods prior to January 1, 2005. Therefore the results for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflect positive retroactive rate adjustments related to the periods prior to January 1, 2005 that did not recur in 2006. Technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $87,793 (17%) as compared to the prior year. This increase is attributable to the following: Return of National Hockey League games after the cancellation of the 2004 2005 season $ 70,153 Lower benefit from amortization of team related purchase accounting liabilities (see discussion below) 23,439 Higher provision for National Basketball Associations luxury tax, including impact of certain team personnel transactions 21,844 Lower net provisions for certain team personnel transactions (excluding the impact of purchase accounting liabilities (see discussion below) and luxury tax)* (17,418 ) Higher other team operating expenses, primarily team personnel compensation 13,828 Higher costs associated with the higher revenues from entertainment events 10,968 Lower broadcast rights fees other than those related to the resumption of the National Hockey League games, primarily due to the termination of the Mets broadcast rights agreement (39,831 ) Other net increases 4,810 $ 87,793 * The change in the provisions for certain team personnel transactions includes the settlement in 2006 of the dispute with the Knicks ex head coach, Larry Brown, under which the Knicks agreed to pay Mr. Brown $18,500 of the disputed amount in connection with his employment agreement. The purchase accounting liabilities discussed above were established in April 2005 as a result of the Companys acquisition of the minority interest in Madison Square Garden. Following this transaction the Company began to amortize these purchase accounting liabilities over the period of the respective player contracts. During 2006 and 2005, the majority of these players were subsequently waived or traded and the unamortized purchase accounting liabilities associated with these players were immediately written off. As a result, the amount of amortization associated with these team personnel transactions declined from $25,358 in 2005 to $3,381 in 2006. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 7% during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the prior year. 66 Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased $20,292 (12%) as compared to the prior year. This increase is attributable to the following: Increase in share based compensation expenses (including the effects of adopting Statement No. 123R effective January 1, 2006) $ 10,396 Higher employee salaries and related benefits due primarily to higher expenses relating to Cablevisions long term incentive plan 6,689 Higher legal and other professional fees 4,153 Return of National Hockey League games after the cancellation of the 2004 2005 season 2,120 Lower charitable contributions due primarily to contributions in 2005 related to Hurricane Katrina relief (4,287 ) Other net increases 1,221 $ 20,292 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1% during the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the prior year. Restructuring charges of $366 for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represent charges recorded as a result of the final cost determination for benefits associated with the elimination of certain staff positions. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased $2,674 (4%) as compared to the prior year resulting primarily from lower depreciation expense due to assets which became fully depreciated. The lower depreciation expense was partly offset by higher amortization due primarily to the amortization of certain intangible assets recorded as a result of the Companys acquisition of the minority interest in Madison Square Garden in April 2005 and the transfer of certain intangibles from another operating segment in 2005. This increase in amortization expense was partly offset by a decrease in the amortization of certain other intangibles that became fully amortized in 2005. 67 Comparison of Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2005 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2004 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $539,941 (12%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunication Services segment $ 482,809 Increase in revenues of the Rainbow segment 19,167 Increase in revenues of the Madison Square Garden segment 25,641 Other net decreases (1,380 ) Intersegment eliminations 13,704 $ 539,941 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization, and impairments) include primarily: cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis; network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections; contractual rights payments to broadcast certain live sporting events and contractual payments pursuant to employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel; amortization of costs to license programming, including feature films, and programming and production costs of our Rainbow businesses; and interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) for 2005 increased $105,661 (5%) compared to 2004. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 228,137 Decrease in expenses of the Rainbow segment (84,607 ) Decrease in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment (42,553 ) Other net decreases (3,502 ) Intersegment eliminations 8,186 $ 105,661 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 3% during 2005 as compared to 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from impairment charges in 2004 amounting to 2% of revenues. 68 Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $107,163 (9%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 67,602 Increase in expenses of the Rainbow segment 3,976 Increase in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment 22,038 Other net increases 7,970 Intersegment eliminations 5,577 $ 107,163 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% during 2005 compared to 2004. Other operating income, net of $95,758 for the year ended December 31, 2004 includes primarily a $54,052 cash payment received in connection with the New York Mets notice of termination of the broadcast rights agreement with Madison Square Garden which was effective at the end of the 2005 baseball season and a $41,788 reversal of a purchase accounting liability related to this broadcast rights agreement. Restructuring credits amounted to $537 in 2005 and $835 in 2004. The 2005 amount is comprised of a $2,060 credit resulting from changes in estimates of facility realignment costs relating to the 2001 and 2002 restructuring plans, partially offset by $1,025 of current severance costs in 2005 and $498 of additional provisions for severance costs associated with the 2004 and 2003 restructuring plans. The 2004 amount is comprised of a $5,761 credit resulting from changes in estimates of facility realignment and other costs relating to the 2001, 2002 and 2003 restructuring plans, partially offset by $4,926 of severance costs. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) decreased $55,032 (5%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from impairment charges in 2004 of $78,497 relating to certain Rainbow DBS assets that were not held for sale and $12,043 related to certain assets of the VOOM HD Networks and lower write off and disposal costs of certain fixed assets in 2005. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $35,508 resulting primarily from depreciation of new fixed assets, impairment charges of $7,697 recorded in 2005 relating primarily to certain long lived assets and intangibles within our theater operations and Rainbow segment and an increase in amortization expense as a result of an increase in amortizable intangibles resulting from the Regional Programming Partners transaction. Net interest expense increased $35,370 (5%) during 2005 compared to 2004. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase due to higher average debt balances $ 56,017 Increase due to higher average interest rates 52,223 Decrease in dividends on CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock due to their redemption in May 2004 (60,593 ) Higher interest income (8,130 ) Other net decreases (4,147 ) $ 35,370 Equity in net income of affiliates amounted to $3,219 in 2005 compared to equity in net loss of affiliates of $12,997 in 2004. Such amounts consist of the Companys share of the net income or loss of certain businesses in which the Company does not have majority ownership interest. 69 Gain on sale of programming and affiliate interests amounted to $64,968 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $2,232 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 2005 gain resulted primarily from the Company and News Corporation restructuring their ownership of National Sports Partners and National Advertising Partners. The 2004 gain resulted from the sale of a minority owned affiliate interest. Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Increase (decrease) in the fair value of Charter Communications, Adelphia Communications, AT&T, AT&T Wireless (2004 period only), Comcast, General Electric and Leapfrog common stock $ (138,459 ) $ 133,544 Income related to other investments 147 1,054 $ (138,312 ) $ 134,598 The effects of these gains and losses are largely offset by the losses and gains on related derivative contracts described below. Write off of deferred financing costs of $18,961 in 2004 consisted of costs written off in connection with the redemption of CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock and CSC Holdings 9 7/8% senior subordinated debentures aggregating $5,080 and termination of certain of the Companys credit agreements aggregating $13,881. Gain (loss) on derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Unrealized and realized gain (loss) due to the change in fair value of the Companys prepaid forward contracts relating to the AT&T, AT&T Wireless (2004 period only), Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric, Leapfrog and Adelphia Communications shares $ 135,677 $ (132,941 ) Loss on exchange right and put option related to CSC Holdings Series A Preferred Stock (31,709 ) Unrealized and realized losses on interest rate swap contracts (16,497 ) (655 ) $ 119,180 $ (165,305 ) The effects of these gains and losses are largely offset by the losses and gains on investment securities pledged as collateral which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $78,571 for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents premiums of $58,170 on the early redemption of CSC Holdings Series H and Series M Redeemable Preferred Stock, $14,325 on the early redemption of CSC Holdings 9 7/8% senior subordinated debentures, and $6,076 on the termination of the AT&T Wireless stock monetization contracts. 70 Minority interests represent other parties share of the net income (losses) of entities which are not entirely owned by us but which are consolidated in our financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 minority interests consisted of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 News Corporations 40% share of the net income or loss of Regional Programming Partners $ 2,123 $ (57,218 ) News Corporations 40% share of the net income of Fox Sports Net Bay Area (6,896 ) Minority partners interest in DTV Norwich 7,850 Other (698 ) (939 ) $ (5,471 ) $ (50,307 ) Net miscellaneous income of $651 for the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from dividends received on certain of the Companys investment securities, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $75,691 for the year ended December 31, 2005 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, state income tax benefit of $12,211, increased by a tax benefit of $6,701 resulting from an adjustment to the state tax rate, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $6,459 relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards and the impact of non deductible officers compensation and other non deducible expenses of $6,226 and $10,637, respectively. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $201,397 in 2004 resulted primarily from the pretax loss, offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of $14,036, non deductible preferred stock dividends of $21,208, a non deductible adjustment related to the exchange right and put option related to the Series A Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings of $11,098, a non deductible redemption premium related to the Series H and M Preferred Stock of CSC Holdings of $20,360, state income tax benefit of $25,692, a tax benefit of $21,615 resulting from an adjustment to the deferred tax rate, and the impact of non deductible officers compensation and other non deductible expenses of $8,303 and $4,776, respectively. Income (loss) from discontinued operations In April 2005, the operations of the Rainbow DBS satellite distribution business were shut down. In connection with the shut down, certain assets of the business, including the Rainbow 1 direct broadcast satellite and certain other related assets were sold to a subsidiary of EchoStar for $200,000 in cash. This transaction closed in November 2005. In April 2005, the Company and News Corporation restructured Regional Programming Partners. As a result, the Company now owns 100% of Madison Square Garden, 50% of Fox Sports Net New England and continues to own 60% of Fox Sports Net Bay Area and no longer owns interests in Fox Sports Net Ohio, Fox Sports Net Florida, National Sports Partners or National Advertising Partners. The Company also owned 100% of Fox Sports Net Chicago which was shut down in June 2006. The operating results of the Fox Sports Net Chicago (which was shut down in June 2006), Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida businesses and those of the Rainbow DBS distribution business, which was shut down in April 2005, have been reported in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. 71 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 reflects the following items, net of related income taxes and minority interests: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 Net operating results of the Rainbow DBS distribution business including shutdown costs (including impairment charges of $188,467 in 2004), net of taxes $ (60,832 ) $ (220,327 ) Net operating results of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida, net of taxes 6,652 22,924 Gain on sale of Fox Sports Net Ohio and Fox Sports Net Florida, net of taxes 266,810 Net operating results of Fox Sports Net Chicago, net of taxes 1,620 13,581 Other, net of taxes 2,603 (1,654 ) $ 216,853 $ (185,476 ) Extraordinary loss, net of taxes of $7,436 for the year ended December 31, 2004 resulted from Rainbow DBS investment in DTV Norwich, LLC and represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of the acquired assets.

The increase in Lightpath net revenues is attributable primarily to growth in Ethernet data services over Lightpaths fiber infrastructure and to growth in traditional data services. As a result, our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the fourth quarter of December 2005 was $100.46 as compared to $88.33 for the fourth quarter of December 2004. The following table presents certain subscriber information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 for the Companys cable television systems: As of December 31, Increase Percent Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) (Decrease) Basic video customers 3,027,000 2,963,000 64,000 2 % iO digital video customers 1,963,000 1,483,000 480,000 32 % Optimum Online high speed data customers 1,694,000 1,353,000 341,000 25 % Optimum voice customers 731,000 273,000 458,000 168 % Residential telephone customers 8,000 9,000 (1,000 ) (11 )% Total revenue generating units 7,423,000 6,081,000 1,342,000 22 % Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for 2005 increased $228,137 (18%) compared to 2004. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) due primarily to subscriber growth, expanded service offerings, and programming rate increases $ 114,548 Increase in field service and network related costs primarily due to growth in revenue generating units 67,563 Increase in call completion and interconnection costs related to the VoIP business due primarily to subscriber growth 28,339 Other net increases, including intra segment eliminations 17,687 $ 228,137 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 1% during 2005 as compared to 2004. 73 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $67,602 (11%) for 2005 as compared to 2004.

Restructuring charges amounted to $295 in 2005 and $736 in 2004. The 2005 amount is comprised of $894 of current severance costs and $297 of additional provisions for severance associated with the 2004 restructuring plans, partially offset by a $896 credit resulting from changes in estimates of facility realignment costs relating to the 2002 restructuring plans. The 2004 amount is comprised of $882 of new provisions associated with the elimination of positions, including severance and outplacement costs, partially offset by a credit of $146 in facility realignment costs relating to the 2001 and 2002 restructuring. Depreciation and amortization increased $56,692 (7%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation of new fixed assets, primarily subscriber devices and increases in amortization expense relating to other amortizable intangibles. Rainbow The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues for the Companys Rainbow segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) in % of Net % of Net Operating Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Income Revenues, net $ 825,561 100 % $ 806,394 100 % $ 19,167 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) 345,567 42 430,174 53 84,607 Selling, general and administrative expenses 327,994 40 324,018 40 (3,976 ) Restructuring credits (77 ) (77 ) Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 113,429 14 213,896 27 100,467 Operating income (loss) $ 38,571 5 % $ (161,617 ) (20 )% $ 200,188 Included in the Rainbow segments results of operations is operating income from AMC, IFC and WE tv aggregating $185,703 and $159,815 and operating losses from Rainbows other programming services aggregating $147,132 and $321,432 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These other programming services consist of Fox Sports Net Bay Area, fuse, Mag Rack, sportskool, 74 News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, VOOM HD Networks, Rainbow Network Communications, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corp. and other Rainbow ventures. The operating loss was attributable primarily to the VOOM HD Networks, as well as the News 12 Networks and fuse which more than offset operating income generated by Fox Sports Net Bay Area. The 2004 operating loss included impairment charges relating to the VOOM HD Networks and certain Rainbow DBS assets that were not held for sale. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $19,167 (2%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in advertising revenues at the AMC/IFC/WE tv and fuse businesses $ 39,552 Increase in affiliate revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue 2,049 Decrease attributable to the MetroChannel business which shut down two of its three channels in the second quarter of 2005 (22,434 ) $ 19,167 Revenue increases discussed above are primarily derived from increases in the level of advertising on our networks, increases in the number of subscribers to our programming services, and increases in fees charged for our services. The following table presents certain viewing subscriber information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004: As of December 31, Percent 2005 2004 Increase Increase (in thousands) Viewing Subscribers: AMC 77,200 76,100 1,100 1.4 % WE tv 50,900 49,900 1,000 2.0 % IFC 37,300 34,600 2,700 7.8 % fuse 35,500 33,100 2,400 7.3 % VOOM HD 25 25 Fox Sports Net Bay Area 3,600 3,600 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $84,607 (20%) compared to 2004. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Net decrease resulting from lower programming and contractual costs for the VOOM HD Networks (including an impairment charge of $75,805 recorded in 2004) $ (107,068 ) Net increase resulting from higher programming and contractual costs at other Rainbow businesses 22,461 $ (84,607 ) As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 11% during 2005 as compared 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from impairment charges in 2004 amounting to approximately 9% of revenues. 75 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3,976 (1%) for 2005 compared to 2004. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses relating to a long term incentive plan $ 9,392 Increase in selling, marketing and advertising costs 3,578 Decrease in administrative costs across all other Rainbow businesses, including a decrease in costs relating to the investigation into improper expense recognition (7,857 ) Decrease in share based compensation expenses (1,137 ) $ 3,976 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2005 compared to 2004. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) decreased $100,467 (47%) for 2005 as compared to 2004. The decrease resulted primarily from impairment charges in 2004 of $78,497 relating to certain Rainbow DBS assets that were not held for sale and $12,043 related to certain assets of the VOOM HD Networks. A decrease of approximately $11,970 resulted primarily from certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in 2004 and a decrease of $3,720 resulted from certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $4,963 resulting from the impairment in 2005 of certain intangibles and $800 from the impairment of fixed assets. Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to net revenues for Madison Square Garden: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) in % of Net % of Net Operating Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Income Revenues, net $ 804,395 100 % $ 778,754 100 % $ 25,641 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 518,773 64 561,326 72 42,553 Selling, general and administrative expenses 169,018 21 146,980 19 (22,038 ) Other operating income (95,840 ) (12 ) (95,840 ) Restructuring charges 366 4,146 3,780 Depreciation and amortization 62,834 8 45,445 6 (17,389 ) Operating income $ 53,404 7 % $ 116,697 15 % $ (63,293 ) 76 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $25,641 (3%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. This net increase is attributable to the following: Net impact of National Hockey League cancellation of 2004 2005 season $ (11,604 ) Absence of National Basketball Association expansion revenue received in 2004 (10,345 ) Absence of Knicks playoff related revenue (6,192 ) Lower revenues from Christmas Spectacular, including touring shows (6,986 ) Other net decreases (2,879 ) Higher MSG Networks revenues due to: Retroactive increase in affiliate rates recorded in 2005 that related to periods prior to January 1, 2005 17,834 Other MSG Networks revenues, (excluding the impact of the cancellation of the NHL 2004 2005 season and the Knicks playoffs reflected above) primarily from net affiliate rate adjustments related to the year ended December 31, 2005 35,101 Net higher revenues from other events at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall 5,709 Higher Knicks related regular season revenues 5,003 $ 25,641 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $42,553 (8%) as compared to the prior year. This net decrease is attributable to the following: Net impact of National Hockey League cancellation of 2004 2005 season $ (37,078 ) Amortization of certain purchase accounting liabilities (32,173 ) Higher net provisions for certain team personnel transactions (excluding the impact of purchase accounting liabilities and luxury tax) 25,032 Higher net provision for luxury tax, including the impact of certain team personnel transactions 2,908 Other net decreases (1,242 ) $ (42,553 ) The purchase accounting liabilities discussed above were established in April 2005 as a result of the Companys acquisition of the minority interest in Madison Square Garden. Following this transaction the Company began to amortize these purchase accounting liabilities over the period of the respective player contracts. Some of these players were subsequently waived or traded before December 31, 2005 resulting in the complete amortization of the associated purchase accounting liabilities. The higher net luxury tax provision of $2,908 resulted primarily from luxury tax associated with a player who was waived prior to the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement and whose contractual obligations are now subject to luxury tax. This was substantially offset by lower luxury tax for the current calendar years portion of the tax for the 2005 2006 season as compared to the prior years portion of the 2003 2004 season. There was no luxury tax attributable to the 2004 2005 season. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $22,038 (15%) as compared to the prior year primarily driven by an increase in expenses related to employee salaries and related benefits, including stock and long term incentive plans, higher professional fees and other costs relating primarily to the Companys efforts to acquire the development rights over the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authoritys Hudson Rail Yards, and higher charitable contributions. Other operating income of $95,840 in 2004 results from the notice of termination of Madison Square Gardens broadcast rights agreement with the New York Mets. In the second quarter of 2004, the New York Mets gave notice of termination of their rights agreement with Madison Square Garden, and with the notice paid Madison Square Garden a contractually obligated termination fee of $54,052. The termination of the rights agreement was effective at the end of the 2005 baseball season. In addition, Madison Square Garden recorded a $41,788 credit reflecting the reversal of a purchase accounting liability related to this rights agreement. 77 Restructuring charges of $366 in 2005 primarily represent charges recorded as a result of the final cost determination for benefits associated with the elimination of certain staff positions. Restructuring charges of $4,146 for 2004 primarily represent severance costs associated with the elimination of certain staff positions in 2004. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased $17,389 (38%), as compared to the prior year. An increase of $10,668 resulted from higher amortization of intangibles primarily due to certain intangible assets recorded as a result of the Companys acquisition of the minority interest in Madison Square Garden. An increase of $6,721 resulted from higher depreciation expense primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation of certain Madison Square Garden Arena assets due to its planned renovation. CSC HOLDINGS, INC. The statement of operations results of CSC Holdings are identical to the statement of operations results of Cablevision, except for the following: Interest expense of $132,784, $124,498 and $85,048 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relating to $1,500,000 of Cablevision senior notes issued in April 2004 included in Cablevisions consolidated statements of operations, Interest income of $3,958 and $89 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to cash held at Cablevision, Miscellaneous expenses of $177 included in Cablevisions consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, and Income tax benefit of $52,831, $50,993 and $35,125 for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, included in Cablevisions consolidated statements of operations related to the items listed above. Refer to Cablevisions Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations herein. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Cablevisions outstanding securities consist of Cablevision NY Group Class A and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock and $1,500,000 of debt securities. Funding for the debt service requirements of our debt securities is provided by our subsidiaries operations, principally CSC Holdings, as permitted by the covenants governing CSC Holdings credit agreements and public debt securities. Funding for our subsidiaries is generally provided by cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under bank credit facilities made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined) and to Rainbow National Services LLC (RNS) and the proceeds from the issuance of notes and debentures in the capital markets. The Company has accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past and may do so in the future. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Cablevision had cash flow from operating activities in excess of capital expenditures. 78 The following table summarizes our outstanding debt and present value of capital leases as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006: Cablevision Restricted Group Rainbow National Services Other Entities Total Bank debt $ $ 4,482,500 $ 510,000 $ $ 4,992,500 Capital leases 256 11,507 49,695 61,458 Notes payable 18,843 18,843 Senior notes and debentures 1,500,000 4,195,480 298,476 5,993,956 Senior subordinated debentures 497,011 497,011 Collateralized indebtedness relating to stock monetizations 921,574 921,574 Total debt $ 1,500,000 $ 8,697,079 $ 1,316,994 $ 971,269 $ 12,485,342 Interest expense $ 132,784 $ 615,460 $ 125,195 $ 54,763 $ 928,202 Capital expenditures $ $ 819,043 $ 5,219 $ 62,035 $ 886,297 Total amounts payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to December 31, 2006 and thereafter, including capital leases and related interest, the value deliverable at maturity under monetization contracts and the $4,992,500 of outstanding bank debt as of December 31, 2006 are as follows: Cablevision Restricted Group Rainbow National Services Other Entities Total 2007 $ $ 611,832 $ 1,676 $ 111,326 * $ 724,834 2008 586,017 26,536 258,972 * 871,525 2009 500,000 1,185,000 26,536 670,455 * 2,381,991 2010 285,000 26,536 3,000 314,536 2011 1,435,000 51,536 3,000 1,489,536 Thereafter 1,000,000 4,598,750 1,196,648 6,795,398 Total $ 1,500,000 $ 8,701,599 $ 1,329,468 $ 1,046,753 $ 12,577,820 * Cablevision has the option, at maturity, to deliver the shares of common stock underlying the monetization contracts along with proceeds from the related derivative contracts in full satisfaction of the maturing collateralized indebtedness or obtain the required cash equivalent of the common stock through new monetization and derivative contracts. The amounts included in the table are $102,469 in 2007, $222,624 in 2008 and $667,455 in 2009. Restricted Group As of December 31, 2006, CSC Holdings and those of its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television video operations (including approximately 3.1 million basic video customers and 2.4 million digital video customers) and high speed data service (which encompasses approximately 2.0 million customers) and our residential voice services operations (which encompasses approximately 1.2 million customers), as well as Optimum Lightpath, our commercial data and voice service business comprise the Restricted Group since they are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and debentures securities issued by CSC Holdings. In addition, the Restricted Group is also subject to the covenants of the debt issued by Cablevision. Sources of cash for the Restricted Group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the Restricted Group, borrowings under its bank credit agreement and issuance of notes and 79 debentures in the capital markets and, from time to time, distributions or loans from its subsidiaries. The Restricted Groups principal uses of cash (excluding the cash used to pay the special dividend discussed below) include capital spending, in particular the capital requirements associated with the growth of its services such as digital video, high speed data and voice; debt service, including distributions made to Cablevision to service interest expense on its debt securities; other corporate expenses and changes in working capital; and investments that it may fund from time to time. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group will be met with cash generated by its operating activities and borrowings under the Restricted Groups bank credit facility and that the Restricted Groups available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet these requirements for the next 12 months. On February 24, 2006, the Restricted Group entered into a $2,400,000 credit facility with a group of banks consisting of three components: a $1,000,000 revolver, a $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility and a $400,000 term A 2 loan facility that has since been refinanced and repaid in full, as described below. Of the $1,400,000 proceeds received from the term loans under the credit facility, $1,265,648 was used to repay the outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under the prior Restricted Group credit facility that was scheduled to mature in June 2006, and $26,059 for fees and expenses. On March 29, 2006, the Restricted Group entered into a $3,500,000 term B loan facility, of which $414,077 of the proceeds was used to prepay the outstanding borrowings of the term A 2 loan facility, including accrued interest, fees and expenses. The balance of the outstanding term B loan facility borrowings was invested in short term AAA rated funds until approval of the special dividend by the Companys Board of Directors, and was then distributed to Cablevision on April 24, 2006 after the special dividend was approved by the Board of Directors. The three components of the new Restricted Group credit facility, the $1,000,000 revolver, the $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility and the $3,500,000 term B loan facility, are direct obligations of CSC Holdings, guaranteed by most Restricted Group subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of the stock of most Restricted Group subsidiaries. As of February 23, 2007, $51,994 of the $1,000,000 revolving credit facility was restricted for certain letters of credit issued on behalf of CSC Holdings and $948,006 of the revolver was undrawn. The revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility mature in six years in February 2012 and the term B loan facility matures in seven years in March 2013. The revolver has no required interim repayments, the $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility requires quarterly repayments aggregating 0% in year one, 5% in each of years two and three, 25% in each of years four and five, and 40% in the final year and the $3,500,000 term B loan facility is subject to quarterly repayments totaling 1% ($8,750 per quarter) in each of years one through six and 94% ($822,500 per quarter) in the final year. The interest rate on the term A 1 loan facility varies, depending on the Restricted Groups cash flow ratio (as defined) from .75% to 1.75% over the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar based borrowings and from zero to .75% over the Base Rate for Base Rate Borrowings (as defined). The interest rate on the borrowings under the term B loan facility is the Eurodollar Rate (as defined) plus 1.75% or prime rate plus .75%, at the Companys election. The weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2006 on borrowings under the term A 1 loan facility and term B loan facility were 6.62% and 7.12%, respectively. The principal financial covenants, which are not identical for the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, on the one hand, and the term B loan facility, on the other, include (i) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, maximum total leverage of 7.50 to 1 with subsequent stepdowns over the life of the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility until reaching 4.50 to 1 for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2010, (ii) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, maximum senior secured leverage of 4.00 times cash flow through December 31, 2006 with annual stepdowns thereafter over the life of the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility until reaching 3.00 to 1 for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2010, (iii) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense of 1.75 to 1 initially, increasing to 2.00 to 1 on and after July 1, 2007, and (iv) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, a minimum ratio of cash flow less cash taxes to total debt expense (defined to include interest expense, certain payments of principal and dividends paid 80 by CSC Holdings to Cablevision to permit Cablevision to pay interest and certain principal payments on its debt) of 1.50 to 1. These covenants and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds in the revolving credit facility may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn revolver funds. Additional covenants include limitations on liens and the issuance of additional debt. Under the term B loan facility, we are limited in our ability to incur additional indebtedness based on a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the term B loan facility) of 7.50 to 1 with subsequent stepdowns over the life of the term B loan facility until reaching 5.00 to 1 for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2010 and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 4.50 times cash flow (as defined in the term B loan facility). Under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, there are generally no restrictions on investments that the Restricted Group may make, provided it is not in default. The Restricted Group can make distributions or other restricted payments so long as CSC Holdings is not in default but there is a limitation (initially $200,000, subject to increase to reflect capital contributions or issuance of equity interests) on restricted payments during any period when the cash flow leverage ratio is greater than 6.00 to 1. The $200,000 limitation does not apply to restricted payments by CSC Holdings to Cablevision to be used by Cablevision to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on its indebtedness. Under the term B loan facility, there also are generally no restrictions on investments that the Restricted Group may make provided it is not in default; however, CSC Holdings must also remain in compliance with the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow and the maximum senior secured leverage ratio. Our ability to make restricted payments is also limited by provisions in the term B loan facility and the indentures covering our notes and debentures. CSC Holdings, a member of the Restricted Group, has issued senior and senior subordinated notes and debentures, which also contain financial and other covenants, though they are generally less restrictive than the covenants contained in the Restricted Groups bank credit facility. Principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow (as defined in the indentures) of 9.00 to 1 and limitations on dividends and distributions. The indentures governing the Cablevision note and debenture issuances contain similar covenants and restrictions, including a limitation on additional debt incurrence based on a 9.00 to 1 debt to cash flow ratio. There are no covenants, events of default, borrowing conditions or other terms in the Restricted Groups credit facility or in any of CSC Holdings or Cablevisions other debt securities that are based on changes in the credit ratings assigned by any rating agency. The Restricted Group was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its various credit agreements as of December 31, 2006. Cablevisions and CSC Holdings future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by their credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Key factors in the assessment of Cablevisions and CSC Holdings credit ratings include Cablevision and CSC Holdings financial strength and flexibility, operating capabilities, management risk tolerance and ability to respond to changes in the competitive landscape. The corporate credit rating for Cablevision and CSC Holdings is B1 with a stable outlook by Moodys and BB with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors. Any future downgrade to the Cablevision and or CSC Holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. See discussion under Item 1A Risk Factors, A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratings agencies may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. 81 Rainbow and Rainbow National Services RNS, our wholly owned subsidiary which owns the common equity interests in the Companys AMC, WE tv and IFC programming operations, generated positive cash from operating activities in 2006. Its cash on hand, plus cash flow from operations and proceeds from borrowings available to it, provides the capital required for net funding and investment requirements of other Rainbow programming entities including the VOOM HD Networks, News 12 Networks and fuse subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in RNS financing agreements. On July 5, 2006, RNS entered into an $800,000 senior secured credit facility (the New RNS Credit Facility) which consists of a $500,000 term A loan facility and a $300,000 revolving credit facility. The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012. The New RNS Credit Facility allows RNS to utilize up to $50,000 of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5,000 for a swing loan. Further, the New RNS Credit Facility provides for an incremental facility of up to $925,000, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100,000. If an incremental facility is established, RNS and the lenders will enter into a supplement to the New RNS Credit Facility with terms and conditions that are no more restrictive than those of the New RNS Credit Facility. There are no commitments from the lenders to fund an incremental facility. On July 5, 2006, RNS borrowed the entire $500,000 term A loan facility and $10,000 under the revolving credit facility. RNS used the $510,000 borrowed under the New RNS Credit Facility and $88,048 of additional available cash to repay all of its outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and fees due under its August 2004 $950,000 senior secured credit facility of which $592,500 was outstanding under a term loan at July 5, 2006 (scheduled to mature March 31, 2012) and to pay certain fees and expenses incurred in connection with the New RNS Credit Facility. RNS may use future borrowings under the New RNS Credit Facility to make investments, distributions, and other payments permitted under the New RNS Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the New RNS Credit Facility may be repaid without penalty at any time. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility at February 23, 2007 were $500,000 and $10,000, respectively. RNS had $290,000 in undrawn revolver commitments at February 23, 2007. Borrowings under the New RNS Credit Facility are direct obligations of RNS which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of its subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC, the direct parent of RNS, and are secured by the pledge of the stock of RNS and substantially all of its subsidiaries, and all of the other assets of RNS and substantially all of its subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). Borrowings under the New RNS Credit Facility bear interest based on either the Base Rate (the greater of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate (as defined in the New RNS Credit Facility)) or the Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the New RNS Credit Facility). The interest rate under the New RNS Credit Facility varies, depending on RNS cash flow ratio (as defined in the New RNS Credit Facility), from 1.0% to 1.5% over the Eurodollar Rate for Eurodollar based borrowings and from zero to 0.5% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the term A loan facility and the revolving credit facility was 6.62% and 6.60%, respectively. The term A loan is to be repaid in quarterly installments of 1.25% of the original outstanding balance ($6,250) from March 31, 2008 until December 31, 2010, 2.5% of the original outstanding balance ($12,500) from March 31, 2011 until December 31, 2012, and 32.5% of the original outstanding balance ($162,500) on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the maturity of the term A loan. Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012. The financial covenants consist of (i) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to total interest expense for each quarter (all as defined in the New RNS Credit Facility) of 1.75 to 1, (ii) a maximum cash flow ratio of total indebtedness to annualized operating cash flow (as defined in the New RNS Credit Facility) of 6.75 to 1 through June 30, 2008, decreasing thereafter to 6.25 to 1, and (iii) a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured debt to annualized operating cash flow (all as defined in the New RNS 82 Credit Facility) of 5.50 to 1. Additional covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, guarantees, liens, investments, dividends and distributions and transactions with affiliates. RNS is obligated to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on any undrawn revolver commitment. RNS also has notes outstanding consisting of $300,000 principal amount of 8 3/4% senior notes due September 1, 2012 and $500,000 principal amount of 10 3/8% senior subordinated notes due September 1, 2014. These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of RNS subsidiaries. RNS was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its various credit agreements as of December 31, 2006. In April 2005, subsidiaries of the Company entered into agreements with EchoStar relating to the launch and operation of the business of Rainbow HD Holdings LLC, the Companys VOOM HD Networks high definition television programming service, subject to the closing of the sale of our satellite (Rainbow 1) to EchoStar which occurred in November 2005. Under those arrangements, EchoStar was initially distributed a portion of the VOOM HD Networks programming service and, beginning in 2006 began carrying all 15 of the channels included in the programming service. In connection with the arrangements, EchoStar was issued a 20% interest in Rainbow HD Holdings, the Companys subsidiary owning the VOOM HD Networks, and that 20% interest will not be diluted until $500,000 in cash has been invested in Rainbow HD Holdings equity by the Company. Under the terms of the affiliation arrangements with EchoStar covering the VOOM HD Networks for a 15 year term, if Rainbow HD Holdings fails to spend $100,000 per year, up to a maximum of $500,000 in the aggregate, on its service offerings, EchoStar may terminate the affiliation agreement. The Company has the right to terminate the affiliation agreement if the VOOM HD Networks are discontinued in the future. RNS future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Key factors in the assessment of RNS credit ratings include its free cash flow generating capacity, fiscal strategy, enterprise value and industry risk. The corporate credit rating for RNS is B1 with a stable outlook by Moodys and BB with a negative outlook by Standard & Poors. Any future downgrade to the RNS credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. See discussion under Item 1A Risk Factors, A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratings agencies may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. Madison Square Garden We currently expect Madison Square Gardens funding requirements for the next twelve months to be met by its cash on hand and cash from operations. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company announced its intent to renovate the MSG Arena. Although management of the Company is committed to this renovation project, another alternative, which would involve construction of a new arena on the site of the Farley post office, is also being pursued. A substantial renovation or relocation of the Arena would require significant funding. 83 Debt Covenants Compliance CSC Holdings and RNS Credit Agreements: On August 29, 2006, CSC Holdings advised the agent bank and the lenders under the new Restricted Group credit facility that due to the expected restatement of its financial statements resulting from the stock option review, it was unable to comply with its covenant to deliver financial information, due on that date, with respect to the periods ended June 30, 2005 and 2006. On August 29, 2006, the lenders under the new Restricted Group credit facility, other than the term B lenders, agreed to waive until September 22, 2006 any default resulting from this covenant noncompliance. CSC Holdings delivered all required information under the new Restricted Group credit facility on September 21, 2006 and the information delivery covenant noncompliance was cured by that delivery. The Restricted Group did not obtain a waiver of the default resulting from this covenant noncompliance from the lenders holding term B loans under the new Restricted Group credit facility and the bank serving as administrative agent under the new Restricted Group credit facility gave a notice of default to CSC Holdings with respect to such term B covenant noncompliance. CSC Holdings delivered all required information under the new Restricted Group credit facility on September 21, 2006, which cured the information delivery covenant noncompliance within the applicable cure period. In December 2005, the Company determined that there were certain technical covenant violations under the prior Restricted Group credit facility and the prior RNS credit facility. CSC Holdings and RNS received waivers from the lenders under the credit facilities and RNS entered into a related amendment of its credit agreement. In addition, the Company obtained waivers under the agreements governing its monetizations and interest rate swaps. On January 31, 2006, the Company announced that it had cured these covenant violations and was in compliance with all of the covenants of its debt instruments. Cablevision and CSC Holdings Indentures: As a result of not filing their Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 by September 8, 2006, Cablevision and CSC Holdings were not in compliance with the information delivery and filing requirements under the indentures relating to their notes and debentures. An entity stating that it represented holders of more than 25% of the outstanding securities of a series under one of Cablevisions indentures notified Cablevision that it is serving a notice of default under the applicable indenture and demanded that the covenant noncompliance be remedied. Cablevision and CSC Holdings delivered all required information under the indentures on September 21, 2006, which cured any potential default within the applicable cure period, upon which time the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its debt instruments. Monetization Contract Maturities During the year ended December 31, 2006, monetization contracts covering 5,586,687 shares of our Charter Communications stock, 3,449,785 shares of our AT&T stock, 12,742,033 shares of our General Electric stock and 7,159,206 shares of our Comcast Communications stock matured. We settled our obligations under the related Charter Communications and AT&T collateralized indebtedness by delivering an equivalent number of Charter Communications and AT&T shares and the cash proceeds from the related equity derivative contracts. We settled our obligations under the related Comcast and General Electric collateralized indebtedness by delivering cash equal to the collateralized loan value, net of the value of the related equity derivative contracts. The cash was obtained from the proceeds of new monetization contracts covering an 84 equivalent number of Comcast and General Electric shares, proceeds from a prepaid interest rate swap executed in conjunction with the equity derivative contract related to the Comcast shares and, in certain instances, cash from CSC Holdings. The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in both Comcast and General Electric shares up to each respective contracts upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited below the respective hedge price. During the next twelve months, monetization contracts covering 3,724,460 shares of Charter Communications stock and 800,000 shares of Leapfrog stock also mature. The Company intends to settle such transactions by either delivering shares of the applicable stock and proceeds of the equity derivative contracts or delivering cash from the proceeds of a new monetization transaction.

See Notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our operating leases. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our feature film obligations. (1) Programming obligations represent contractual commitments with various programming vendors to provide video services to the Companys subscribers. Future fees under such contracts are based on numerous factors, including the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Amounts reflected above are based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming as of December 2006 multiplied by the per subscriber rates contained in the executed agreements in effect as of December 31, 2006. (2) Purchase obligation amounts not reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of (i) long term rights agreements which provide Madison Square Garden and other regional sports networks with exclusive broadcast rights to certain live sporting events in exchange for minimum contractual payments, (ii) payments under employment agreements that we have with our professional sports teams personnel that are generally guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination, and (iii) minimum purchase requirements incurred in the normal course of the Companys operations. (3) Operating lease commitments represent primarily future minimum payment obligations on various long term, noncancelable leases for office and storage space, lease commitments for Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theater and Clearview Cinemas, and rental space on utility poles used for the Companys Telecommunications Segment. (4) Includes outstanding guarantees primarily by CSC Holdings in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations and potential early termination events in connection with the monetization of the Companys holdings of Charter Communications. Amounts payable under such monetization guarantees are estimated as of a particular point in time by the financial institution counterparty and are based upon the current price of the underlying common stock and various other assumptions, including stock market volatility and prevailing interest rates. Such guaranteed amounts approximate the fair value of the monetization indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar as reflected in the Companys accompanying consolidated balance sheet. (5) Consist primarily of letters of credit obtained by CSC Holdings in favor of insurance providers and certain governmental authorities for the Telecommunications Services segment. (6) Excludes interest payments and includes future payments due on the Companys (i) bank debt, (ii) senior notes and debentures, (iii) senior subordinated notes and debentures, (iv) collateralized indebtedness, and (v) notes payable. 88 (7) Reflects the face amount of capital lease obligations, including related interest. (8) Consist principally of amounts earned under employment agreements that we have with our professional sports teams personnel. Other long term obligations also include deferred carriage payments. The future cash payments reflected above do not include the impact of potential insurance recoveries or amounts which may be due to the NBA for luxury tax payments. In addition, the future cash payments reflected above do not include the payments required under the Companys agreements with EchoStar relating to the launch and operation of the business of Rainbow HD Holdings, the Companys VOOM HD Networks high definition television programming service. EchoStar was issued a 20% interest in Rainbow HD Holdings, the Companys subsidiary owning the VOOM HD Networks programming service, and that 20% interest will not be diluted until $500,000 in cash has been invested in Rainbow HD Holdings by the Company. Under the terms of the affiliation arrangements with EchoStar covering the VOOM HD Networks for a 15 year term, if Rainbow HD Holdings fails to spend $100,000 per year, up to a maximum of $500,000 in the aggregate, on its service offerings, EchoStar may terminate the affiliation agreement. The Company has the right to terminate the affiliation agreement if the VOOM HD Networks are discontinued in the future. On the fifth or eighth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, the termination of the affiliation agreement by EchoStar, or other specified events, EchoStar has a put right to require a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings to purchase all of its equity interests in Rainbow HD Holdings at fair value. On the seventh or tenth anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, or the second anniversary date of the termination of the Affiliation Agreement by EchoStar, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings has a call right to purchase all of EchoStars ownership in Rainbow HD Holdings at fair value. Managing our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Interest Rate Risk To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and have only entered into transactions with counterparties that are rated investment grade. All of our interest rate derivative contracts are entered into by CSC Holdings and are thus attributable to the Restricted Group; all such contracts are carried at their fair market values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Equity Price Risk We have entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric, and Leapfrog. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair market value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. Please refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these transactions. 89 See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of certain wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in the Charter Communications transactions and certain of the 2005 Comcast transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair market value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. Related Party Transactions Dolan Family Group Proposals On June 19, 2005, the Company received a proposal from the Dolan Family Group to acquire the outstanding, publicly held interests in the Company following a pro rata distribution to all Company stockholders of Rainbow Media Holdings. On October 24, 2005, Cablevision received a letter from the Dolan Family Group withdrawing the June 19, 2005 proposal. In that letter, the Dolan Family Group also recommended that the Companys Board of Directors consider the declaration of a $3 billion one time, special dividend payable pro rata to all shareholders. The dividend was paid on April 24, 2006 to holders of Cablevision NY Group Class A common stock and Cablevision NY Group Class B common stock. On October 8, 2006, the Company received a proposal from the Dolan Family Group (the Dolan Family Group Proposal) to acquire, at a purchase price of $27.00 per share in cash, all the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock, except for the shares held by the Dolan Family Group. The Dolan Family Group Proposal contemplated that substantially all of the purchase price would be funded by the incurrence of additional indebtedness by Cablevision, CSC Holdings, RNS and several other subsidiaries of the Company. Cablevisions Board of Directors appointed a special transaction committee (the Committee) of independent directors, which consisted of Thomas V. Reifenheiser and Vice Admiral John R. Ryan USN (Ret.), to review the proposal. The Committee retained Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, as its legal counsel, and Lehman Brothers Inc. and Morgan Stanley, as financial advisors. On January 12, 2007, the Committee received a letter from Charles F. Dolan and James L. Dolan, on behalf of members of the Dolan Family Group, outlining a revised proposal (the Revised Proposal) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Cablevision, except for the shares held by the Dolan Family Group, at a purchase price of $30.00 per share in cash. On January 16, 2007, the Committee delivered a letter to Charles F. Dolan and James L. Dolan, rejecting the Revised Proposal as inadequate. The Revised Proposal expired on January 17, 2007. There can be no assurances that the Dolan Family Group will not propose, undertake or consummate a similar transaction in the future. 90 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (Statement No. 159). Statement No. 159 permits entities to elect, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. An entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date, and recognize upfront costs and fees related to those items in earnings as incurred. Statement No. 159 is effective as of January 1, 2008 for the Company. Early adoption is permitted, but an entity is prohibited from retrospectively applying Statement No. 159, unless it chooses early adoption of Statement No. 157 and Statement No. 159. SFAS No. 159 also applies to eligible items existing at January 1, 2008 (or when the date of early adoption occurs). In December 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position No. EITF 00 19 2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements (FSP 00 19 2). FSP 00 19 2 provides guidance related to the accounting for registration payment arrangements and specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement, whether issued as a separate arrangement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or arrangement, should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (Statement No. 5). FSP 00 19 2 requires that if the transfer of consideration under a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated at inception, the contingent liability under such arrangement shall be included in the allocation of proceeds from the related financing transaction using the measurement guidance in Statement No. 5. FSP 00 19 2 applies immediately to any registration payment arrangement entered into subsequent to the issuance of FSP 00 19 2. For such arrangements issued prior to the issuance of FSP 00 19 2, the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of FSP 00 19 2 will have on its financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (Statement No. 157). Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under Statement No. 157, fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts. It also clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. This Statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. Accordingly, this Statement does not require any new fair value measurements, however, for some entities, the application of Statement No. 157 could change current practices. Statement No. 157 will be effective for financial statements issued with fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of Statement No. 157 will have on its financial statements. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of SFAS No. 109. This Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Any change in the net assets and liabilities recognized as a result of applying the provisions of FIN 48 would be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a significant impact on its financial statements. 91 In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation) (EITF No. 06 3), which addresses the income statement disclosures for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer, and may include, but are not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. The presentation of taxes on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 22. In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant and can be done on an aggregate basis. EITF No. 06 3 will be effective for financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006. Had the Company adopted EITF 06 3 for the year ended December 31, 2006, the amount of franchise fees that would have been separately disclosed as a component of net revenue would have approximated $101,000. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. All dollar amounts, except per subscriber, per unit and per share data, included in the following discussion under this Item 7A are presented in thousands. Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the shares of Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric and Leapfrog common stock held by us. We have entered into prepaid forward contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share, while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. The following table details our estimated early termination exposure as of December 31, 2006: Comcast Charter Communications General Electric Leapfrog Total Collateralized indebtedness (carrying value) $ (431,123 ) $ (83,231 ) $ (388,183 ) $ (19,037 ) $ (921,574 ) Collateralized indebtedness (fair value estimate) (423,211 ) (83,404 ) (375,483 ) (18,937 ) (901,035 ) Derivative contract (116,576 ) 69,787 (46,573 ) 11,353 (82,009 ) Fair value of investment securities pledged as collateral 606,098 11,397 474,131 7,584 1,099,210 Net excess (shortfall) 66,311 (2,220 ) 52,075 116,166 Net excess (shortfall) including prepaid swaps $ 66,311 $ (2,220 ) $ 52,075 $ $ 116,166 92 The underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. The carrying value of our collateralized indebtedness amounted to $921,574 at December 31, 2006. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of General Electric, Charter Communications, Comcast, or Leapfrog stock (as the case may be), with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast, Charter Communications, General Electric and Leapfrog common stock aggregated $1,099,210. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $109,921. As of December 31, 2006, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of certain of these securities aggregated $82,009, a net payable position. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net loss on all outstanding equity derivative contracts of $214,352. We also recorded an unrealized and realized gain on our holdings of the underlying stocks of $284,096 for the year ended December 31, 2006, as shown in the following table: Fair Market Value of Equity Derivative Contracts Fair market value as of December 31, 2005 $ 296,017 Change in fair value (214,352 ) Maturity of contracts (163,674 ) Fair market value as of December 31, 2006 $ (82,009 ) Unrealized and realized gain on underlying stock positions due to changes in prevailing market conditions, net $ 284,096 In addition, at December 31, 2006, the Company had other investment securities with a carrying value of approximately $10,715. Assuming a 10% change in the price of the securities, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $1,072. The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via a prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: # of Shares Hedge Price Cap Price** Security Deliverable Maturity per Share* Low High Comcast 7,159,206 2008 $ 26.69 $41.2 3 $ 33.57 $ 49.48 7,159,206 2009 Charter Communications 3,724,460 2007 $ 22.35 $ 38.33 $ 38.33 General Electric 12,742,033 2009 $ 32.52 $34.14 $ 39.03 $ 40.96 Leapfrog 800,000 2007 $ 24.05 $ 30.37 $ 30.37 * Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. ** Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2006, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $6,886,074 exceeded its carrying value of $6,812,986 by $73,088. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR based market rates and thus approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2006 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $236,505 to $7,122,579. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. 93 Interest Rate Derivative Contracts: Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating rate debt, including $3,500,000 of debt incurred in 2006 to fund the approximately $3,000,000 special dividend described herein and to repay existing indebtedness of approximately $414,000, including accrued interest, fees and expenses. To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. In addition, from time to time we may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. All of our interest rate derivative contracts are entered into by CSC Holdings and are thus attributable to the Restricted Group; all such contracts are carried at their fair market values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of $450,000. As of December 31, 2006, the fair market value and carrying value of these interest rate swap contracts was $6,568, a net liability position, reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2006 prevailing levels would increase the fair value of these contracts to a net liability of $10,963. As of December 31, 2006, we also had outstanding interest rate swap contracts in the notional amount of $3,700,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2006, these interest rate swap contracts had a fair market value and carrying value of $31,398, a net liability position, as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2006 would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by $98,663 to a liability of $130,061. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net loss on interest swap contracts of $36,473, as detailed in the table below: Fair Market Value of Interest Rate Derivative Contracts Fair market value as of December 31, 2006, a net payable position $ (37,966 ) Less: fair market value as of December 31, 2005 (10,541 ) Change in fair market value, net (27,425 ) Plus: realized loss from cash interest expense (9,048 ) Net loss on interest rate swap contracts $ (36,473 ) 94 In addition, we had outstanding at December 31, 2006 prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of $105,061 entered into in connection with our monetization transactions. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of our prepaid interest rate derivative contracts was $10,340, a net liability position. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates from December 31, 2006 prevailing levels would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by $697 to a liability of $11,037. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a net loss on such derivative contracts of $2,887 as detailed below: Fair Market Value of Prepaid Interest Rate Derivative Contracts Fair market value as of December 31, 2005 $ (26,881 ) Change in fair market value, net 23,037 New derivative contract (6,496 ) Fair market value as of December 31, 2006 $ (10,340 ) Change in fair market value, net $ 23,037 Realized loss resulting from net cash payments (25,924 ) Net gain on prepaid interest rate swap contracts $ 2,887
