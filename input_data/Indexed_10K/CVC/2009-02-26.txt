Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. Continued market disruptions from the world wide financial crisis could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services and entertainment, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers inability to pay for the services we provide. We have experienced some of the effects of this economic downturn. Continuation of events such as these may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Telecommunications Services Our Telecommunications Services segment, which accounted for 71% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, derives revenues principally through monthly charges to subscribers of our video, high speed data and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services and its commercial data and voice services operations. These monthly charges include fees for cable television programming, as well as, in many cases, equipment rental, pay per view and video on demand, high speed data and voice services. Revenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers to these services, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers, and upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe. We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems. Revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems. Programming costs are the most significant part of our operating expenses and are expected to increase as a result of digital subscriber growth, additional service offerings and contractual rate increases. Our cable television video services, which accounted for 41% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, face competition from the direct broadcast satellite (DBS) business and the delivery systems of incumbent telephone companies. There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have. We compete with these DBS competitors by bundling our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high speed data service and voice service carried over the cable distribution plant, as well as by providing interactive services that are currently unavailable to a DBS subscriber. As discussed in greater detail below, we face intense competition from incumbent telephone companies, Verizon and AT&T, which offer video programming in addition to their voice and high speed Internet access services, evidencing their commitment to compete across all of the Companys telecommunications products. Their competitive position has been improved by recent operational, regulatory and legislative advances that they have made. Historically, we have made substantial investments in the development of new and innovative programming options and other product enhancements for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors. We likely will continue to do so in order to be a more effective competitor. Verizon and AT&T offer video programming as well as voice and high speed Internet access services to residential customers in our service area. Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our service area (currently about one third of the households according to our estimates). Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service (it already has or needs no authority to provide phone and data services) for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey and in numerous local franchises in New York. In July 2008, the New York Public Service Commission granted regulatory approval for Verizon to provide cable television 51 Table of Contents service to all of New York City. Verizon has so far not indicated any plans to offer video service in Connecticut. AT&T offers video service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area. Our high speed data services business, which accounted for 15% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, faces competition from other providers of high speed Internet access, including DSL and fiber based services offered by local telephone companies such as Verizon and AT&T. In addition, DBS providers have tested the use of certain spectrum to offer satellite based high speed data services and are offering broadband data services via partnerships and marketing arrangements with other providers such as Verizon, AT&T and Earthlink. Our growth rate in cable modem customers has slowed from the growth rates we have experienced in the past due to our already high penetration (51.9% of homes passed at December 31, 2008) and, to a lesser extent, intensifying competition. Our VoIP offering, which accounted for 9% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited United States, Canada and Puerto Rico long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price. To the extent the incumbents, who have financial resources that exceed those of the Company, decide to meet our pricing and or features or reduce their pricing, future growth and success of this business may be impaired. Our growth rate in VoIP customers has slowed from the growth rates we have experienced in the past due to our increasing penetration (39.7% of homes passed at December 31, 2008) and, to a lesser extent, intensifying competition. The regulatory framework for cable modem service and voice service is being developed and changes in how we, and our competitors, are regulated, including increased regulation, may affect our competitive position. Our advertising and other revenues accounted for 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008. Optimum Lightpath, which accounted for 3% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies incumbent local exchange companies such as Verizon and AT&T, other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies. To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of our Optimum Lightpath business may be impaired. The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless data medium. Should this trend accelerate dramatically, future growth of Optimum Lightpath may be negatively impacted. In October 2008, Optimum Lightpath completed the acquisition of 4Connections LLC which allows Optimum Lightpath to expand its ability to offer advanced Ethernet based data and Internet voice products to businesses in the New Jersey region. Rainbow In our Rainbow segment, which accounted for 14% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, we earn revenues in two principal ways. First, we receive affiliate fee payments from cable television system operators, DBS operators and telephone companies (collectively referred to as operators). These revenues are generally on a per subscriber basis and earned under multi year contracts with those operators referred to as affiliation agreements. The specific affiliate fee revenues we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks, but are generally based upon the number of each operators subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers, or are a fixed contractual monthly fee. The second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising. Under our affiliation agreements, we have the right to sell a specific amount of national advertising time on our programming networks. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fee revenues because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis, not under long term contracts. Also, most 52 Table of Contents of our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services. We seek to grow our revenues in the Rainbow segment by increasing the number of operators that carry our services and the number of viewing subscribers. We refer to this as our penetration. AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than our newer, less penetrated services. Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements. In negotiating for increased or extended carriage, we may be subject to requests by operators to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers or extended carriage, which we record as deferred carriage fees and which are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related affiliation agreements, or to waive for a specified period or accept lower per subscriber fees if certain additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the operators efforts to market our channels. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees (deferred carriage), discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period. We seek to increase our advertising revenues by increasing the number of minutes of national advertising sold and by increasing rates for such advertising, but, ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues, in most cases, is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services, and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services. Our principal goals in this segment are to increase our affiliate fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our national services. To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high quality, attractive programming. One of our greatest challenges arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few operators, creating disparate bargaining power between the largest operators and us. This increased concentration could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration. In addition, this concentration gives those operators greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements. Moreover, as a result of this concentration, the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would have a significant adverse impact on this segment. On June 16, 2008, the Company acquired Sundance Channel L.L.C. Sundances results of operations and net assets are included in the Rainbow segment for the period subsequent to June 16, 2008 (see Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements). Madison Square Garden Madison Square Garden, which accounted for 14% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, consists of our professional sports teams (principally the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), along with the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League and the New York Liberty of the Womens National Basketball Association), a regional sports programming business, and an entertainment business, as well as the operations of Fuse, a national music programming network. It also operates the Madison Square Garden Arena, Radio City Music Hall, the WaMu Theater and the Beacon Theatre in New York City, and the Chicago Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, which was acquired in October 2007. Through June 30, 2007, it also operated the Hartford Civic Center and Rentschler Field (sports and entertainment venues in Connecticut). In addition, in June 2008, Madison Square Garden purchased a minority ownership interest in Front Line Management Group Inc., a musical artist management company. Madison Square Garden faces competitive challenges unique to these business activities. We derive revenues in this segment primarily from our programming businesses (see below), the sale of tickets, including luxury box rentals, to sporting and entertainment events, from rental rights fees paid to this 53 Table of Contents segment by promoters that present events at our entertainment venues and the sports teams share of league wide distributions of national television rights fees and royalties. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at our owned and operated venues, from food, beverage and merchandise sales at these venues and from the licensing of our trademarks. Madison Square Gardens regional sports programming business and Fuse derive their revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television operators (including our cable television systems), DBS operators and telephone companies that provide video service and sales of advertising. Increases in affiliate fee revenues result from a combination of changes in rates and changes in the number of viewing subscribers. This segments financial performance is affected by the performance of all the teams presented and the attractiveness of its entertainment events and programming content. Our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales, paid attendance, luxury box rentals, and food, beverage and merchandise sales. To a large extent, the ability of the teams to build excitement among fans, and therefore produce higher revenue streams, depends on the teams winning performance, which generates regular season and playoff attendance and luxury box rentals, and which also supports increases in prices charged for tickets, luxury box rentals, and advertising placement. Each teams success is dependent on its ability to acquire highly competitive personnel. The governing bodies of the NBA and the NHL have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective leagues, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing our professional sports teams results of operations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings NHL Litigation for a discussion of a pending dispute between Madison Square Garden, L.P. and the NHL. Madison Square Gardens regional sports programming business is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of professional sports teams and other sports related programming, in addition to our proprietary programming. The continued carriage and success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising, as well as the ability to attract advertisers. Fuses business is affected by its ability to acquire or develop desired music related content for the network. While Madison Square Gardens regional sports programming business is widely distributed in the New York metropolitan area, it, along with Fuse, faces the same challenges in increasing affiliate fee and advertising revenues as the Rainbow segments programming businesses discussed above. Madison Square Gardens entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our Radio City Christmas Spectacular and our touring Christmas shows, as well as the availability of, and our venues ability to attract, concerts, family shows and other events. The dependence of this segments revenues on its sports teams and Christmas shows generally make it seasonal with a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income being derived in the fourth quarter of each year. Newsday Newsday, which accounted for approximately 2% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008, consists of the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, Island Publications and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com. See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Newsday Transaction which was completed on July 29, 2008. The Companys consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the operating results of Newsday subsequent to the closing date of the transaction on July 29, 2008. Newsday has experienced a decline in net operating revenues and net earnings primarily due to decreased advertising revenues. The decrease in advertising revenues, particularly in the classified category, have resulted from the current economic environment and increased competition for advertising dollars from 54 Table of Contents other media, particularly the internet, and is expected to continue in 2009. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Demand for advertising, increased competition and declines in circulation affect our Newsday business. Newsdays revenue is derived primarily from the sale of advertising and the sale of newspapers (circulation revenue). For the period from July 30, 2008 through December 31, 2008, advertising revenues accounted for 81% of the total revenues of Newsday. Newsdays financial success is largely dependent on advertising revenue. Advertising revenue is derived from printed ads that run in the newspaper and niche publications, preprinted advertisements that are inserted into the newspaper and preprinted sticky notes that are applied to the front of the paper. In addition, advertising revenue also includes newspaper online advertising consisting of banner ads, video ads, floating ads, expanding ads, search engine advertising and online classified advertising for auto, recruitment and real estate. Local economic conditions can affect the levels of retail and classified newspaper advertising revenue. General economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, readership and circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising. All of these factors, along with the competitive and seasonal factors discussed below, contribute to a challenging advertising sales environment and have adversely impacted our ability to maintain our revenues. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Demand for advertising, increased competition and declines in circulation affect our Newsday business. Seasonal variations in consumer spending can cause quarterly advertising revenues to fluctuate. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues, reflecting the historically slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season. The first quarter is historically the slowest quarter for revenues and profits. The level of advertising sales in any period may also be affected by advertisers decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand and general economic conditions. For the period from July 30, 2008 through December 31, 2008, circulation revenues accounted for 17% of the total revenues of Newsday. Newsdays circulation revenue is derived primarily from home delivery subscriptions of the Newsday daily newspaper, and single copy sales of Newsday at the newsstand or through local retail outlets. Approximately 72% of the circulation revenues were derived from subscription sales, which provide readers with the convenience of home delivery, and are an important component of Newsdays circulation base. Single copy rates for Newsday range from $0.50 to $0.75 per daily copy and $1.59 to $2.00 per Sunday copy. Newsday actively promotes single copy sales, which comprised 28% of circulation revenue. In recent years, circulation has generally declined throughout the newspaper industry, and Newsdays newspapers have generally experienced this trend. A decrease in home delivery subscriptions and single copy sales of newspapers could adversely impact circulation revenue as well as advertising revenue. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Demand for advertising, increased competition and declines in circulation affect our Newsday business. The basic material used in publishing newspapers is newsprint. Management believes Newsdays sources of newsprint, along with available alternate sources, are adequate for its current needs. Consolidation in the North American newsprint industry has reduced the number of suppliers and has led to paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper, which in turn has decreased overall newsprint capacity and increased the likelihood of future price increases for materials used by Newsday. The Company recorded pre tax impairment charges of $59,522, $8,199 and $333,159 related to indefinite lived intangibles, certain long lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively, originally recorded by the Company in conjunction with its acquisition of Newsday on July 29, 2008. These impairment charges reflect the continuing deterioration of values in the newspaper industry and the greater than anticipated economic downturn and its current and anticipated impact on Newsdays advertising business. 55 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following: Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets: The Companys long lived and indefinite lived assets at December 31, 2008 include goodwill of $1,100,333, other intangible assets of $1,795,534 ($982,856 of which are indefinite lived intangibles), $3,472,640 of property, plant and equipment and long term program rights of $495,219. Such assets accounted for approximately 73% of the Companys consolidated total assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For other long lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other long lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. For the Telecommunications Services segment, these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of homes passed, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed, among other assumptions. For the Madison Square Garden and Rainbow segments, these valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers used to determine affiliate fee revenue, number of events (MSG segment only), access to sports programming and feature film rights and the cost of such sports programming and feature film rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell through rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. For the Newsday segment, these valuations also include assumptions for advertising and circulation revenue trends, operating margin, market participant synergies, and market multiples for comparable companies. If these estimates or 56 Table of Contents material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Companys reporting units on the impairment calculation for goodwill, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the goodwill impairment analysis for any of the Companys reporting units. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the Companys indefinite lived intangibles, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each of the Companys indefinite lived intangibles. This hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value would have resulted in an additional impairment charge of approximately $9,000. Rights to programming, including feature films and episodic series, acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed, unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability, then the earlier of when the uncertainty is resolved, or when the license period has begun. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on a straight line basis over the respective license periods. We periodically review the programming usefulness of our program rights based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness of exhibition. If it is determined that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited, a write off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films is recorded in technical and operating expense. Owned original programming is produced for us by independent production companies. Any owned original programming costs qualifying for capitalization as program rights are amortized to technical and operating expense over their estimated useful lives, commencing upon the first airing, based on attributable revenue for airings to date as a percentage of total projected attributable revenue. Projected program usage is based on the historical performance of similar content. Estimated cash flows can change based upon programming market acceptance, levels of affiliate fee revenue and advertising revenue, and program usage. Accordingly, we periodically review revenue estimates and planned usage and revise our assumptions if necessary which could impact the timing of amortization expenses. We recorded impairment losses of $416,985, $1,804 and $2,104 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, included in depreciation and amortization. The 2008 impairment loss includes $400,880 related to indefinite lived intangibles, certain long lived intangible assets and goodwill of our Newsday segment. The 2007 impairment loss relates to certain other long lived assets and goodwill related to certain subsidiaries in our Rainbow segment and the 2006 impairment loss relates to certain other long lived assets of our theater operations and our PVI Virtual Media business. In addition, we have recorded impairment losses of approximately $1,129, $3,160 and $1,640 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, included in technical and operating expense, representing primarily the impairment of certain film and other programming contracts. In 2008, we recorded impairment losses of $42,519, included in restructuring expense, which related primarily to impairments of certain contractual programming rights ($40,974) resulting from the decision to discontinue the U.S. domestic programming business of VOOM. 57 Table of Contents Useful Lives of Finite Lived Intangible Assets: The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements, affiliate relationships, broadcast rights and other agreements, advertiser relationships, season ticket holder relationships, suite holder relationships and other intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The Company has determined that certain of such intangible assets have finite lives. The estimated useful lives and carrying values of these intangibles at December 31, 2008 are as follows: Carrying Value at December 31, 2008 Estimated Useful Lives Affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships $ 575,875 4 to 25 years Broadcast rights and other agreements 5,547 10 years Season ticket holder relationships 54,078 10 to 15 years Suite holder relationships 10,148 11 years Advertiser relationships 81,892 4 to 10 years Other intangible assets 85,138 1 to 29 years The amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships finite lived intangible assets in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships. The useful lives for the affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average remaining terms of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its major affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 4 to 10 years for affiliation agreements and 24 to 25 years for affiliate relationships is appropriate. There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewal. In one case during 2004, there was a 10 day period in which an affiliate was restricted from carrying certain of the Companys sports and entertainment networks because the parties had not reached agreement on contract renewal terms. We reached a short term agreement with the affiliate at the end of the 10 day period and that affiliate continuously carried the networks pursuant to successive subsequent short term agreements through March 7, 2005. However, we were unable to reach an agreement with this affiliate at expiration on March 7, 2005, and this affiliate discontinued carriage of certain of the Companys sports networks. On May 9, 2005, we reached a multi year agreement on key rate and positioning terms for carriage of these sports networks and the parties subsequently entered into definitive documentation reflecting such agreement. See Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets discussion above. If an affiliate were to cease carrying the service on an other than temporary basis, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement and affiliate relationship intangible asset. If the Company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under 58 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets for the asset group containing that intangible asset. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliation agreement and affiliate relationship remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2008 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization for the year ending December 31, 2009 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $7,400. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs. The Company increased the valuation allowance by $6,602 in 2008 and decreased the valuation allowance in 2007 and 2006, by $536 and $10,404, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, certain state NOLs expired prior to utilization. The deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired NOLs had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $2,681, $1,122 and $2,638 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Companys cable television system, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Companys hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (12 to 25 years) and headend facilities (4 to 15 years). Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to connect businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the infrastructure or digital platform are also capitalized. These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor to connect, provision and provide on site and remote technical assistance and other related costs associated with the connection activities. In addition, on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity.

See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Newsday Transaction which was completed on July 29, 2008. The Company allocates certain amounts of corporate overhead to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services, except for Newsday as to which the Company allocates only the incremental costs incurred in providing these services. The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect inter segment eliminations unless specifically indicated. See Business Segments Results for a more detailed discussion relating to the operating results of our segments. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $745,635 (11%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunication Services segment $ 444,198 Increase in revenues of the Rainbow segment, including revenues attributable to Sundance subsequent to acquisition in June 2008 136,585 Increase in revenues of the Madison Square Garden segment 40,776 Revenues of Newsday subsequent to the date of the transaction on July 29, 2008 180,597 Other net decreases (1,001 ) Inter segment eliminations (55,520 ) $ 745,635 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) include primarily: cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis; network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections; contractual rights expense to broadcast certain live sporting events and contractual compensation expense pursuant to employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel; 63 Table of Contents amortization of costs to license programming, including program rights, and programming and production costs of our Rainbow and Madison Square Garden segments; interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers; and publication production and distribution costs of our Newsday segment. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) in 2008 increased $353,049 (12%) as compared to 2007.

Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $179,902 (12%) for 2008 as compared to 2007. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 68,106 Increase in expenses of the Rainbow segment, including expenses attributable to Sundance subsequent to acquisition in June 2008 42,263 Increase in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment 26,466 Expenses of the Newsday segment subsequent to the date of the acquisition on July 29, 2008 51,194 Other net decreases (4,310 ) Inter segment eliminations (3,817 ) $ 179,902 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2008 compared to 2007. Restructuring expense amounted to $49,883 in 2008 and $4,733 in 2007. The 2008 amount primarily includes the impairment of program rights of $40,974 and employee severance and other costs of $5,821 due to the Companys decision in December 2008 to discontinue the U.S. programming business of VOOM and $7,225 primarily relating to severance and other restructuring charges recognized by our Newsday segment. Partially offsetting these charges were net credits of $4,137 primarily associated with adjustments to facility realignment provisions and other costs recorded in connection with the 2001, 2002 and 2006 restructuring plans. The 2007 amount related primarily to severance and other costs of $3,123 associated with the 2007 restructuring plans and adjustments to facility realignment provisions and other costs recorded in connection with the 2001, 2002 and 2006 restructuring plans of $1,610. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) increased $388,921 for 2008 as compared to 2007. The net increase consisted of $400,880 of impairment charges related to indefinite lived 64 Table of Contents intangibles, certain long lived intangible assets and goodwill at our Newsday segment, an impairment charge of $15,034 relating to the write off of deferred carriage fees at VOOM after EchoStar Communications Corporation (EchoStar) ceased the distribution of VOOM in May 2008, an increase of $16,336 representing the depreciation and amortization resulting from the acquisition of the Sundance Channel in June 2008, and an increase of $13,691 representing the depreciation and amortization of Newsday subsequent to the date of the transaction on July 29, 2008. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of $57,020 resulting primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated and certain asset retirements in the first quarter of 2007. Interest expense, net decreased $117,824 (13%) during 2008 compared to 2007. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease due to lower average interest rates on our indebtedness $ (107,079 ) Net decrease due to change in average debt balances (37,851 ) Lower interest income 26,098 Other net increases 1,008 $ (117,824 ) Equity in net income of affiliates amounted to $4,377 in 2007. Such amount consists primarily of the Companys share of the net income of Fox Sports Net New England. Gain on sale of programming and affiliate interests, net of $805 for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted from the sale of our ownership interests in sportskool and Lifeskool. The gain on sale of programming and affiliate interest of $183,286 for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulted from the sale of our 50% equity interest in the Fox Sports Net New England business in June 2007. Loss on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $136,414 and $214,257, respectively, consists primarily of the net increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast, General Electric, Charter Communications, and Leapfrog common stock owned by the Company during the respective periods. The effects of these losses are partially offset by the gains on related derivative contracts described below. Gain on equity derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $118,219 and $214,712, respectively, consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses due to the change in fair value of the Companys equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast, General Electric, Charter Communications, and Leapfrog shares owned by the Company during the respective periods. The effects of these gains are partially offset by the losses on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in loss on investments, net discussed above. Loss on interest rate swap contracts, net amounted to $205,683 and $76,568 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates. The loss on interest rate swap contracts in 2008 included unrealized losses of $153,417 reflecting changes in the fair value of the Companys swap contracts, which resulted primarily from a downward shift in the yield curve over the life of the contracts. Write off of deferred financing costs of $2,919 for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents costs written off in connection with the partial redemption in August 2007 of Rainbow National Services senior subordinated notes due 2014. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,424 for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted from the repayment of the Companys collateralized indebtedness relating to its holdings of shares of General Electric common stock during the second quarter of 2008. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $19,113 for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents the excess of the redemption price over the carrying value 65 Table of Contents of the $175,000 principal amount of the Rainbow National Services senior subordinated notes due 2014 redeemed in August 2007. Minority interests for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $8,108 and $321, respectively, represent other parties share of the net income (losses) of entities which are not entirely owned by us but which are consolidated in our financial statements. Net miscellaneous income of $1,264 and $2,636 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, resulted primarily from dividends received on certain of the Companys investment securities, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $82,688 for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted primarily from the Companys pretax loss, state income tax expense of $15,757, tax benefit of $8,670 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes, tax expense of $2,694, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions, an increase in the valuation allowance of $6,602 relating to certain state NOLs and the tax impact of non deductible officers compensation and other non deductible expenses of $5,934 and $2,640, respectively. Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations of $79,181 for the year ended December 31, 2007 resulted primarily from the Companys pretax income, state income tax expense of $7,120, tax expense of $10,831 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes, tax expense of $8,849, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions, and the tax impact of non deductible officers compensation and other non deductible expenses of $9,355 and $6,285, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance of $536 relating to certain state NOLs. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company has fully offset federal taxable income with a net operating loss deduction. However, the Company is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and certain state and local income taxes that are payable quarterly. Income (loss) from discontinued operations In June 2007, the Company completed the sale of its 60% interest in Fox Sports Net Bay Area, to Comcast. In addition, in June 2006 and April 2005, respectively, the operations of the Fox Sports Net Chicago programming business and the Rainbow DBS satellite distribution business were shut down. As a result, the operating results of these businesses, net of taxes, have been classified in the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflects the following items, net of related income taxes and minority interests: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Gain (loss) on sale of Fox Sports Net Bay Area, net of taxes $ (3 ) $ 186,281 Net operating results of the Rainbow DBS distribution business, net of taxes (943 ) 4,167 Net operating results of Fox Sports Net Bay Area, net of taxes 4,787 $ (946 ) $ 195,235 66 Table of Contents Business Segments Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for the Companys Telecommunications Services segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) in Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Operating Income Revenues, net $ 5,165,367 100 % $ 4,721,169 100 % $ 444,198 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 2,174,295 42 2,006,880 43 (167,415 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 978,313 19 910,207 19 (68,106 ) Depreciation and amortization 890,912 17 929,606 20 38,694 Operating income $ 1,121,847 22 % $ 874,476 19 % $ 247,371 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $444,198 (9%) as compared to revenues for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Percent Years Ended December 31, Increase Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) (Decrease) Video (including analog, digital, pay per view, video on demand and digital video recorder) $ 2,961,421 $ 2,774,291 $ 187,130 7 % High speed data 1,099,634 1,013,462 86,172 9 % Voice 685,643 534,553 151,090 28 % Advertising 115,574 118,473 (2,899 ) (2 )% Other (including installation, home shopping, advertising sales commissions, and other products) 98,736 105,519 (6,783 ) (6 )% Total cable television 4,961,008 4,546,298 414,710 9 % Optimum Lightpath 248,776 215,476 33,300 15 % Intra segment eliminations (44,417 ) (40,605 ) (3,812 ) (9 )% Total Telecommunications Services $ 5,165,367 $ 4,721,169 $ 444,198 9 % Revenue increases reflected above are primarily derived from increases in the number of subscribers to our high speed data and voice services, including additional services sold to our existing video subscribers (set forth in the table below), acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers, higher rates, and upgrades by video customers from the level of the programming package to which they subscribe, offset in part by offer discounts and other rate changes. As a result, our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the three months ended December 31, 2008 was $134.85 as compared with $125.10 for the three months ended December 31, 2007, a 7.8% increase. Our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $133.11. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services. 67 Table of Contents The following table presents certain subscriber information as of December 31, 2008, September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 for the Companys cable television systems (excluding Optimum Lightpath): As of December 31, 2008 As of September 30, 2008 As of December 31, 2007 (in thousands) Basic video customers 3,108 3,112 3,123 iO digital video customers 2,837 2,814 2,628 Optimum Online high speed data customers 2,455 2,427 2,282 Optimum voice customers 1,878 1,825 1,592 Total revenue generating units 10,278 10,178 9,625 For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company had a decline of 14,900 basic video customers compared to a decline of 3,700 in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company added 653,400 revenue generating units (RGUs), as compared to 797,500 in 2007. The decline in growth of RGUs of 144,100 is net of an increase in iO digital video customers of approximately 93,800 due to a digital migration initiative that eliminated the duplicate analog feeds of nine channels carried in digital. The growth in RGU additions slowed compared to 2007 as a result of the Companys relatively high penetration rates and, to a lesser extent, the effects of intensifying competition, particularly from Verizon. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for 2008 increased $167,415 (8%) compared to 2007. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) due primarily to subscriber growth, expanded service offerings, programming rate increases and the cost to carry VOOM beginning July 1, 2007 $ 102,792 Increase in field service and network related costs primarily due to growth in revenue generating units and general cost increases 45,163 Increase in call completion and interconnection costs, taxes, and fees (net of related intra segment eliminations) primarily due to higher VoIP fees and higher voice customers, partially offset by lower rates 10,509 Increase in franchise fees 9,205 Other net decreases (348 ) Intra segment eliminations 94 $ 167,415 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 1% during 2008 as compared to 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $68,106 (7%) for 2008 as compared to 2007. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs $ 36,651 Increase in customer related costs (principally call center and billing related costs) primarily due to growth in revenue generating units and general cost increases 21,215 Increase in other general and administrative costs 15,668 Decrease in share based compensation expense and expenses related to Cablevisions long term incentive plans (5,393 ) Intra segment eliminations (35 ) $ 68,106 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2008 as compared to 2007. 68 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization decreased $38,694 (4%) for 2008 as compared to 2007. The net decrease resulted primarily from lower depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated in 2007. Rainbow The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for the Companys Rainbow segment. Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) in Operating Income 2008 2007 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Revenues, net $ 980,133 100 % $ 843,548 100 % $ 136,585 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) 362,861 37 328,436 39 (34,425 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 378,727 39 336,464 40 (42,263 ) Restructuring expense 46,834 5 2,820 (44,014 ) Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 113,570 11 89,117 11 (24,453 ) Operating income $ 78,141 8 % $ 86,711 10 % $ (8,570 ) The Rainbow segments operating income is comprised of the following: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Operating income (loss): AMC, WE tv and IFC $ 265,182 $ 239,567 Other programming services (187,041 ) (152,856 ) $ 78,141 $ 86,711 Other services primarily consist of News 12 Networks, IFC Entertainment, Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation (RASCO), sportskool (sold in September 2008), Lifeskool (sold in October 2008), Rainbow Network Communications (RNC), VOOM, and the results of Sundance Channels operations from the date of acquisition (June 16, 2008) through December 31, 2008. The operating losses from Rainbows other services were attributable primarily to VOOM and the News 12 Networks, and to a lesser extent to IFC Entertainment, Sundance and RASCO. 69 Table of Contents Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $136,585 (16%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The increase is attributable to the following: Increase in affiliate fee revenues and other revenue at Rainbows other services* $ 58,878 Increase in advertising revenues at the AMC, WE tv, and IFC businesses 38,923 Increase in affiliate fee revenues and other revenue at the AMC, WE tv and IFC businesses resulting primarily from increases in viewing subscribers and rates 33,788 Net increase in advertising/sponsorship revenues at Rainbows other programming businesses resulting primarily from the acquisition of Sundance in June 2008, partially offset by a decrease in advertising revenue at RASCO 4,996 $ 136,585 * Increase for the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily from the acquisition of Sundance in June 2008 and from the growth in distribution of VOOM by Cablevision which launched July 2007, partially offset by the loss of EchoStars carriage of VOOM in May 2008. In December 2008, the Company decided to discontinue the U.S. programming business of VOOM, and effective January 20, 2009, Cablevision ceased carriage of VOOM.

Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $34,425 (10%) compared to 2007. The increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs at the AMC, WE tv and IFC businesses due primarily to increased non film programming costs, programming related costs and broadband/video on demand related costs $ 18,644 Net increase resulting primarily from programming and contractual costs of Sundance from the date of acquisition and increased costs of RNC and News 12 Networks, partially offset by decreases at IFC Entertainment, Lifeskool and sportskool 15,781 $ 34,425 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 2% during 2008 as compared to 2007. 70 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $42,263 (13%) for 2008 compared to 2007. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in administrative costs primarily related to legal expenses, rent related expenses, management fees paid to CSC Holdings driven by increased revenues, and the acquisition of Sundance in June 2008 $ 24,831 Increase in selling, marketing and advertising costs at the AMC, WE tv and IFC businesses primarily related to an increase in marketing and promotion of original programming and an increase in advertising sales related expenses due to increased advertising sales revenue 21,048 Increase in selling, marketing and advertising costs at Rainbows other services primarily related to the acquisition of Sundance in June 2008, partially offset by lower marketing and promotional activities at IFC Entertainment, Lifeskool and sportskool 2,437 Decrease in share based compensation expense and expenses relating to Cablevisions long term incentive plans (6,053 ) $ 42,263 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2008 compared to 2007. Restructuring expense of $46,834 for the year ended December 31, 2008 represents primarily the impairment of program rights of $40,974 and employee severance and other costs of $5,821 due to the Companys decision in December 2008 to discontinue the U.S. programming business of VOOM. Restructuring charges of $2,820 for the year ended December 31, 2007 represents primarily severance charges resulting from the elimination of certain staff positions due to the consolidation and reorganization of certain departments. The Company currently anticipates that it will recognize an impairment loss of approximately $5,000 associated with off balance sheet programming and other commitments in the first quarter of 2009 related to VOOM. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) increased $24,453 (27%) in 2008 as compared to 2007. Amortization expense (including impairments) increased $30,223 for 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to amortization expense of $16,131 relating to amortizable identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Sundance and the write off of $15,034 of deferred carriage fees at VOOM HD after EchoStar ceased the distribution of VOOM in May 2008. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in depreciation expense of $5,770 as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to certain VOOM fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in 2007. 71 Table of Contents Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for the Companys Madison Square Garden segment.

Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 of $(214,257) and $290,052 respectively, consists primarily of the net change in the fair value of Comcast, General Electric, AT&T, Charter Communications, Leapfrog, and Adelphia Communications common stock owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2007, the Companys investment securities held as collateral consist of Comcast and General Electric common shares. Our holdings of AT&T, Charter, Leapfrog and Adelphia common stock were delivered to each counterparty in connection with the settlement of their related monetization contracts upon their maturity. The effects of these gains and losses are largely offset by the losses and gains on related derivative contracts described below.

However, the Company is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and certain state and local income taxes. Income (loss) from discontinued operations In April 2005, the operations of the Rainbow DBS satellite distribution business were shut down. In connection with the shut down, certain assets of the business, including the Rainbow 1 direct broadcast 77 Table of Contents satellite and certain other related assets were sold to a subsidiary of EchoStar for $200,000 in cash. This transaction closed in November 2005. In 2006, the Company accrued $50,898, including interest, reflected as an expense in discontinued operations, as a result of the judgment entered against Cablevision and Rainbow DBS in the Loral matter (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings). The Company has posted a cash collateralized bond in the amount of $52,159, which is reflected as restricted cash in the Companys consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007. In April 2005, the Company and News Corporation restructured Regional Programming Partners.

As a result, our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the three months ended December 31, 2007 was $125.10 as compared with $115.30 for the three months ended December 31, 2006. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services and intra segment revenue from the VoIP business. 79 Table of Contents The following table presents certain subscriber information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 for the Companys cable television systems (excluding Optimum Lightpath): As of December 31, Increase Percent Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) (Decrease) (in thousands) Basic video customers 3,123 3,127 (4 ) iO digital video customers 2,628 2,447 181 7 % Optimum Online high speed data customers 2,282 2,039 243 12 % Optimum voice customers 1,592 1,209 383 32 % Residential telephone customers 5 (5 ) (100 )% Total revenue generating units 9,625 8,827 798 9 % The Company had a decline of approximately 4,000 basic video customers, however it added approximately 798,000 RGUs in 2007. The Company had slower growth during 2007 than experienced in prior years in iO digital video customers (181,000 in 2007 compared with 484,000 during 2006), Optimum Online customers (243,000 in 2007 compared with 345,000 during 2006) and voice customers (383,000 in 2007 compared with 478,000 during 2006). The reduction in basic video subscribers and the slowing growth in other service offerings reflect the impact of the Companys relatively high penetration rates and, to a lesser extent, the effects of intensifying competition, particularly from Verizon. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company had an increase of approximately 1,000 basic video customers and added approximately 208,000 RGUs. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for 2007 increased $232,273 (13%) compared to 2006. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) due primarily to increases in the video services purchased by our subscribers, expanded service offerings, and programming rate increases $ 139,312 Resolution of a contractual programming dispute in 2006* 26,476 Increase in field service and network related costs primarily due to growth in revenue generating units 56,592 Increase in call completion and interconnection costs, taxes, and fees (net of related intra segment eliminations) primarily due to our flat rate international service offering which began in the second quarter of 2006 and subscriber growth, partially offset by lower rates 14,283 Increase in franchise fees 10,435 Net decrease in expense primarily due to presentation of certain customer related taxes as a reduction of revenue in 2007** (15,360 ) Other net increases 32 Intra segment eliminations 503 $ 232,273 * Represents the collection of $26,476 in 2006 related to the resolution of a contractual programming dispute, $19,476 of which was due in periods prior to 2006 but not recognized as a reduction to programming costs because it was being disputed and was not being paid by the affiliate. The underlying contract was terminated in June 2006 and no further payments will be received under the contract.

We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group for the next 12 months, including the repayment of Cablevision senior notes aggregating $500,000 which mature in April 2009 and CSC Holdings senior notes aggregating $900,000 which mature in July and August 2009, will be met with proceeds from the senior note issuances by CSC Holdings in January and February of 2009 and one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities, and borrowings under the Restricted Groups credit facility. 89 Table of Contents The Restricted Groups credit facility consists of three components: a $1,000,000 revolver, a $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility and a $3,500,000 term B loan facility. The three components of the Restricted Group credit facility are direct obligations of CSC Holdings, guaranteed by most Restricted Group subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of the stock of most Restricted Group subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2008, $55,508 of the $1,000,000 revolving credit facility was restricted for certain letters of credit issued on behalf of CSC Holdings and $944,492 of the revolver was undrawn. The revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility mature in February 2012 and the term B loan facility matures in March 2013. The revolver has no required interim repayments. The $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility requires quarterly repayments of $62,500 in 2009 and 2010 and $100,000 in 2011. The $3,500,000 term B loan facility is subject to quarterly repayments of $8,750 through March 31, 2012 and $822,500 beginning on June 30, 2012 through its maturity date in March 2013. The borrowings under the Restricted Group credit facility may be repaid without penalty at anytime. Outstanding borrowings under the term A 1 loan facility and term B loan facility were $900,000 and $3,403,750, respectively, at December 31, 2008. The weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2008 on borrowings under the term A 1 loan facility and term B loan facility were 2.195% and 2.945%, respectively. The Restricted Groups credit facility contains various financial and other covenants. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the covenants. The Restricted Group was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit facility as of December 31, 2008. CSC Holdings, a member of the Restricted Group, has issued senior notes and debentures, which also contain financial and other covenants, though they are generally less restrictive than the covenants contained in the Restricted Groups bank credit facility. On January 13, 2009, CSC Holdings issued $844,000 face amount of 8 1/2% senior notes due April 15, 2014. These notes are senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by any of CSC Holdings subsidiaries. CSC Holdings may redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time at a price equal to 100% of the face amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium. Gross proceeds from the issuance were approximately $750,189, after giving effect to the original issue discount of approximately $93,811. In addition, we incurred estimated financing costs of approximately $18,000. The proceeds will be used to repay or repurchase upcoming senior note maturities at Cablevision and CSC Holdings due in 2009. On February 12, 2009, CSC Holdings issued $526,000 face amount of 8 5/8% senior notes due February 15, 2019. These notes are senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by any of CSC Holdings subsidiaries. CSC Holdings may redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time at a price equal to 100% of the face amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium. Gross proceeds from the issuance were approximately $500,731 after giving effect to the original issue discount of approximately $25,269. In addition, we incurred estimated financing costs of approximately $12,000. The proceeds will be used to repay or repurchase upcoming senior note maturities at Cablevision and CSC Holdings due in 2009. On February 13, 2009, Cablevision announced that it commenced a cash tender offer for its outstanding $500,000 face amount of floating rate senior notes due April 1, 2009 for total consideration of $1,002.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes tendered for purchase, consisting of tender offer consideration of $997.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes plus an early tender premium of $5.00 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes. Concurrently, CSC Holdings announced that it commenced a cash tender offer for (1) its outstanding $500,000 face amount of 8 1/8% senior notes due July 15, 2009 for total consideration of $1,022.84 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes tendered for purchase, consisting of tender offer consideration of $1,000.00 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes plus an early tender premium of $22.84 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes, and (2) its outstanding $400,000 face amount of 8 1/8% senior debentures due August 15, 2009 for total consideration of $1,027.63 per $1,000.00 principal amount of debentures tendered for purchase, consisting of tender offer consideration of $1,000.00 per $1,000.00 principal amount of debentures plus an early tender premium of $27.63 per $1,000.00 principal amount of debentures. Holders must tender their securities by 11:59 p.m., New York 90 Table of Contents City time, on February 27, 2009, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the applicable total consideration. Holders who tender their securities after such time and prior to the expiration date will be eligible to receive the applicable tender offer consideration, which is the total consideration less the early tender premium. On June 4, 2008, CSC Holdings issued $500,000 face amount of 8 1/2% senior notes due June 15, 2015. These notes are senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by any of CSC Holdings subsidiaries. CSC Holdings may redeem the senior notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 104.250% of face value on or after June 15, 2012, 102.125% on or after June 15, 2013, and 100% on or after June 15, 2014, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay CSC Holdings $500,000 face amount of 7 1/4% senior notes upon maturity in July 2008. Cablevisions and CSC Holdings future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by their credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Key factors in the assessment of Cablevisions and CSC Holdings credit ratings include Cablevisions and CSC Holdings financial strength and flexibility, operating capabilities, management risk tolerance and ability to respond to changes in the competitive landscape. The corporate credit rating for Cablevision and CSC Holdings is Ba3 by Moodys with a stable outlook and BB by Standard & Poors with a negative outlook. Any future downgrade to the Cablevision and or CSC Holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. In March 2008, CSC Holdings entered into several interest rate swap contracts that amended the terms of contracts (specifically maturity date and fixed rate paid by CSC Holdings) originally entered into in April 2006 with a notional amount of $3,700,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on a substantial portion of its floating rate debt. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The table below summarizes certain terms of these interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2008: Maturity Date Notional Amount Weighted Average Fixed Rate Paid by the Company Weighted Average Effective Floating Rate Received by the Company at December 31, 2008* March 2010 $ 1,100,000 3.65 % 2.16 % June 2012 $ 2,600,000 4.86 % 2.16 % * Represents the floating rate received by the Company under its interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2008 and does not represent the rates to be received by the Company on future payments. Rainbow and Rainbow National Services RNS, our wholly owned subsidiary which owns the Companys AMC, WE tv and IFC programming operations, generated positive cash flow from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Its cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from borrowings available to it under its revolving credit facilities provide the capital required for net funding and investment requirements of other Rainbow programming entities including the continuing international operations of the VOOM HD Networks and News 12 Networks subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in RNS financing agreements. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of RNS for the next twelve months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and available borrowings under RNS bank credit facilities. RNS has an $800,000 senior secured credit facility (the RNS Credit Facility), which consists of a $500,000 term A loan facility and a $300,000 revolving credit facility. The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012. The RNS Credit Facility allows RNS to utilize up to $50,000 of the 91 Table of Contents revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5,000 for a swing loan. Further, the RNS Credit Facility provides for an incremental facility of up to $925,000, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100,000. On June 3, 2008, RNS entered into an Incremental Revolver Supplement (Incremental Revolver) whereby RNS received commitments from lenders in the amount of $280,000. The interest rate under the Incremental Revolver is 2.0% over the Eurodollar rate for Eurodollar based borrowings and 1.0% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings (as defined in the Incremental Revolver). The Incremental Revolver matures on June 30, 2012 and the terms and conditions of the Incremental Revolver are no more restrictive than those of the RNS credit facility currently outstanding. RNS is obligated to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on any undrawn portion of the Incremental Revolver commitment balance. Borrowings under the Incremental Revolver may be repaid without penalty at any time. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Incremental Revolver facility at December 31, 2008. Outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were $475,000 and $225,000, respectively, at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rates on the term A loan facility and amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility were 2.195% and 2.003%, respectively. RNS had $75,000 in undrawn revolver commitments at December 31, 2008. Borrowings under the RNS Credit Facility are direct obligations of RNS which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of its subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC (RPH), the direct parent of RNS, and are secured by the pledge of the stock of RNS and substantially all of its subsidiaries, and all of the other assets of RNS and substantially all of its subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). The term A loan requires quarterly repayments of $6,250 in 2009 and 2010, $12,500 in 2011 and 2012, and $162,500 on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the maturity of the term A loan. Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012. The RNS Credit Facility contains various financial and other covenants. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the covenants. RNS was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement and Incremental Revolver as of December 31, 2008. In addition, RNS is also subject to covenants of the senior and senior subordinated notes it has issued, which are generally less restrictive than those contained in the credit agreement. RNS future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Key factors in the assessment of RNS credit ratings include its free cash flow generating capacity, fiscal strategy, enterprise value and industry risk. The corporate credit rating for RNS is Ba3 by Moodys with a stable outlook and BB by Standard & Poors with a negative outlook. Any future downgrade to the RNS credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. In November 2008, RNS entered into interest rate swap contracts with a notional amount of $450,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on a substantial portion of its floating rate debt. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The table below summarizes certain terms of these interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2008: Maturity Date Notional Amount Weighted Average Fixed Rate Paid by the Company Weighted Average Effective Floating Rate Received by the Company at December 31, 2008* November 2009 $ 450,000 1.84 % 1.20 % * Represents the floating rate received by RNS under its interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2008 and does not represent the rates to be received by RNS on future payments. 92 Table of Contents As a result of the CSC Holdings and RNS interest rate swap transactions, the interest rate paid on approximately 87% of the Companys debt (excluding capital leases and collateralized indebtedness) as of December 31, 2008 is effectively fixed (51% being fixed rate obligations and 36% is effectively fixed through utilization of these interest rate swap contracts). After giving effect to the repayment of Cablevisions $500,000 of floating rate senior notes on April 1, 2009 and issuance of CSC Holdings fixed rate senior note issuances of $844,000 and $526,000 in January 2009 and February 2009, respectively, the interest rate to be paid on approximately 92% of the Companys debt will be effectively fixed (58% being fixed rate obligations and 34% through utilization of interest rate swap contracts). Madison Square Garden Madison Square Garden does not currently have a credit facility in place. Effective January 1, 2008, Madison Square Garden began providing the capital required for net funding and investment requirements of Fuse. Prior to January 1, 2008, funding for Fuse was provided by RNS. We currently expect Madison Square Gardens funding requirements for the next 12 months to be met by its cash on hand and cash from operations. The Company previously announced its intent to move forward with a major arena renovation plan and that it expected to spend approximately $500,000 through 2011 on this project. The pre construction planning of this renovation continues and the Company recently retained construction managers to develop a detailed project budget and project time line. The Company continues to work toward substantially completing the renovation within the original time frame, but no assurance can be given that either this time frame or the initial estimate will be met. The cost of the renovation is expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand, cash flow from its operations and or new borrowings. Newsday LLC On July 29, 2008, Newsday LLC borrowed $650,000 under its new senior secured credit facility which was used primarily to distribute approximately $630,000 to Tribune Company (see Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements). Newsdays senior secured credit facility, rated B1 with a stable outlook by Moodys and BB+ by Standard & Poors, is comprised of two components: a $525,000 9.75% fixed rate term loan facility and a $125,000 floating rate term loan facility. In February 2009, Standard and Poors placed the BB+ rating on Newsdays senior secured debt on CreditWatch with negative implications. The senior secured credit facility matures on August 1, 2013 and, subject to certain exceptions, requires mandatory prepayments out of the proceeds of certain sales of property or assets, insurance proceeds and debt and equity issuances. No mandatory prepayments are required prior to July 29, 2011, and the amount of prepayments thereafter are limited to $105,000 in the aggregate prior to July 29, 2012 and $140,000 in the aggregate prior to the maturity date. Optional prepayments are also permitted, subject to specified prepayment premiums. The interest rate on the floating rate term loan facility is the Eurodollar rate (as defined) plus 5.50%, and at December 31, 2008 was approximately 9.008%. Borrowings by Newsday LLC under its senior secured credit facility are guaranteed by Newsday Holdings LLC, NMG Holdings, Inc. and CSC Holdings on a senior unsecured basis and secured by a lien on the assets of Newsday LLC, and the Cablevision senior notes receivable held by Newsday Holdings LLC. The Newsday credit facility contains various financial and other covenants. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the covenants. Newsday was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2008. We currently expect that net funding and investment requirements for Newsday LLC for the next 12 months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating 93 Table of Contents activities, interest income from the Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC, capital contributions and intercompany advances. Monetization Contract Maturities In connection with the acquisition of Sundance Channel L.L.C. in June 2008, the Company terminated the monetization contracts relating to 12,742,033 shares of common stock of General Electric Company and made payments to the counterparties aggregating $368,097. In addition, monetization contracts covering our 10,738,809 shares of Comcast stock matured during 2008. We settled our obligations under the related Comcast collateralized indebtedness, net of the value of the related equity derivative contracts, by delivering cash from the net proceeds of new monetization transactions covering an equivalent number of Comcast shares. The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in Comcast shares up to each respective contracts upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited to the respective hedge price. During the next twelve months, monetization contracts covering 10,738,809 shares of Comcast Corporation mature. The Company intends to either settle such transactions by delivering shares of the applicable stock and the related equity derivative contracts or by delivering cash from the net proceeds of new monetization transactions. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a discussion of our monetization contracts. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Commitments The Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008, which consist primarily of our debt obligations, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due by Period Total Year 1 Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 years Other Off balance sheet arrangements: Programming obligations (1) $ 1,888,524 $ 639,588 $ 962,890 $ 280,582 $ 5,464 $ Purchase obligations (2) 1,916,922 551,182 375,494 158,509 831,737 Operating lease obligations (3) 1,030,029 114,148 222,825 202,039 491,017 Guarantees (4) 10,375 10,375 Letters of Credit (5) 57,908 4,286 53,622 4,903,758 1,319,579 1,561,209 694,752 1,328,218 Contractual obligations reflected on the balance sheet: Debt obligations (6) 11,939,210 1,955,986 2,009,474 6,348,750 1,625,000 Program rights obligations (7) 469,644 127,271 169,031 101,991 71,351 Capital lease obligations (8) 84,697 9,442 18,631 10,774 45,850 Contract obligations (9) 59,683 25,237 10,159 5,888 18,399 Taxes (10) 9,035 9,035 12,562,269 2,117,936 2,207,295 6,467,403 1,760,600 9,035 Total $ 17,466,027 $ 3,437,515 $ 3,768,504 $ 7,162,155 $ 3,088,818 $ 9,035 See discussion above regarding payment options the Company has on its monetization contracts. See Notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our operating leases. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our program rights obligations. 94 Table of Contents (1) Programming obligations represent contractual commitments with various programming vendors to provide video services to the Companys subscribers. Future fees under such contracts are based on numerous factors, including the number of subscribers receiving the programming. Amounts reflected above are based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming as of December 2008 multiplied by the per subscriber rates contained in the executed agreements in effect as of December 31, 2008. (2) Purchase obligation amounts not reflected on the balance sheet consist primarily of (i) long term rights agreements which provide Madison Square Garden with exclusive broadcast rights to certain live sporting events in exchange for minimum contractual payments, (ii) payments under employment agreements that we have with our professional sports teams personnel that are generally guaranteed regardless of employee injury or termination, and (iii) minimum purchase requirements incurred in the normal course of the Companys operations. (3) Operating lease obligations represent primarily future minimum payment commitments on various long term, noncancelable leases for office, production and storage space, lease commitments for Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre and Clearview Cinemas, and rental space on utility poles used for the Companys Telecommunications Services Segment. (4) Includes outstanding guarantees primarily by CSC Holdings in favor of certain financial institutions in respect of ongoing interest expense obligations and potential early termination events in connection with the monetization of the Companys holdings of shares of Comcast Corporation common stock.

(10) This amount represents noncurrent tax liabilities, including accrued interest, relating to uncertain tax positions. The future cash payments reflected above do not include the impact of potential insurance recoveries or amounts which may be due to the NBA for luxury tax payments. EchoStar was issued a 20% interest in VOOM HD Holdings, the Companys subsidiary operating VOOM, and that 20% interest will not be diluted until $500,000 in cash has been invested in VOOM HD Holdings by the Company. On the fifth or eighth anniversary of the effective date of the investment agreement, the termination of the affiliation agreement by EchoStar, or other specified events, EchoStar has a put right to require a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings to purchase all of its equity interests in VOOM HD Holdings at fair value. On the seventh or tenth anniversary of the effective date of the investment agreement, or the second anniversary date of the termination of the affiliation agreement by EchoStar, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings has a call right to purchase all of EchoStars ownership in VOOM HD Holdings at fair value. The table above does not include any future payments that would be required upon the exercise of the put right, if any. See Item 3. Legal Proceeding EchoStar Contract Dispute. An indirect subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings owns a 90% interest in DTV Norwich LLC. The other investor has the right, for ten years, to put its remaining 10% interest to the Company at fair value to be determined by a process involving independent valuation experts. The table above does not include any future payments that would be required upon the exercise of this put right. At any time after the thirteenth anniversary of the closing of the Newsday Transaction and on or prior to the date that is six months after such anniversary, Tribune Company will have the right to require CSC Holdings to purchase Tribune Companys entire interest in Newsday Holdings LLC at the fair value of the interest at that time (see Note 2). The table above does not include any future payments that would be required upon the exercise of this put right. 95 Table of Contents Managing our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Interest Rate Risk To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and have only entered into transactions with counterparties that are rated investment grade. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. Interest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads. Interest rate swap contracts have been entered into by each of CSC Holdings and RNS. All such contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Equity Price Risk We have entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of common stock of Comcast Corporation. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in certain of the Comcast transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (Statement No. 141R). Statement No. 141R requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. Statement No. 141R is effective for the Company for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The provisions of Statement No. 141R will not impact the Companys financial statements for prior periods. 96 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (Statement No. 160). Statement No. 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. Statement No. 160 is effective as of January 1, 2009 for the Company. The Company has not yet determined the impact that the adoption of Statement No. 160 will have on its financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (Statement No. 161). Statement No. 161 requires specific disclosures regarding the location and amounts of derivative instruments in the Companys financial statements; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Companys financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Statement No. 161 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The Company will provide the required disclosures regarding derivative instruments in 2009. In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. FSP No. FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP No. FAS 142 3 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the impact FSP No. FAS 142 3 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, which amends Statement 132(R) Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106, to require more detailed disclosures about employers plan assets, including employers investment strategies, major categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. The disclosure requirements of FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1 will be required to be included in the Companys consolidated financial statements beginning for the year ending December 31, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued EITF 07 1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements (EITF 07 1). EITF 07 1 defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties. EITF 07 1 also establishes the appropriate income statement presentation and classification for joint operating activities and payments between participants, as well as the disclosure requirements related to these arrangements. EITF 07 1 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The Company has not yet determined the impact EITF 07 1 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All dollar amounts, except per subscriber, per unit and per share data, included in the following discussion under this Item 7A are presented in thousands. Valuation of Financial Instruments The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (Statement No. 157) effective January 1, 2008 for financial assets and financial liabilities. Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirement for fair value measurements. For a discussion regarding the measurement of the fair value of the Companys financial instruments, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. 97 Table of Contents Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the shares of Comcast Corporation common stock held by us. We have entered into equity derivative contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2008, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. The carrying value of our collateralized indebtedness amounted to $448,738 at December 31, 2008. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast common stock, with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $362,542. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $36,254. As of December 31, 2008, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the equity derivative contracts entered into to partially hedge the equity price risk of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $113,737, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a net gain on our outstanding equity derivative contracts of $118,219. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we also recorded unrealized and realized losses of $132,849 on our holdings of Comcast and GE common stock that we held during the period. Fair Value of Equity Derivative Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2007, net receivable position $ 51,162 Change in fair value, net 118,219 Settlement of contracts (55,644 ) Fair value as of December 31, 2008, net receivable position $ 113,737 The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via an equity derivative prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: # of Shares Hedge Price Cap Price (b) Security Deliverable Maturity per Share (a) Low High Comcast 10,738,809 2009 $17.80 $27.49 $ 23.13 $ 32.99 8,069,934 2010 $20.03 $22.07 $ 30.04 $ 33.10 2,668,875 2011 $16.14 $ 20.98 $ 20.98 (a) Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. (b) Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. 98 Table of Contents In addition, at December 31, 2008, the Company had other investment securities with a carrying value of approximately $6,804. Assuming a 10% change in the price of the securities, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $680. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2008, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $5,640,658 was less than its carrying value of $6,293,595 by $652,937. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR based market rates and thus approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2008 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $163,019 to $5,803,677. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund the approximately $3 billion special dividend paid in 2006, our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes and have only entered into transactions with counterparties that are rated investment grade. The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. Our interest rate swap contracts have been entered into by CSC Holdings and RNS. All such contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2008, CSC Holdings entered into several interest rate swap contracts that amended the terms of existing contracts (specifically maturity date and fixed rate paid by CSC Holdings) originally entered into in April 2006 in the notional amount of $3,700,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on floating rate debt. In November 2008, RNS entered into interest rate swap contracts with a notional amount of $450,000. As of December 31, 2008, these interest rate swap contracts had a fair value and carrying value of $265,937, a net liability position, as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2008 would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately $90,709 to a liability of $356,646. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a net loss on interest swap contracts of $205,931, as detailed in the table below: Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2007, a net liability position $ (108,141 ) Change in fair value, net (157,796 ) Fair value as of December 31, 2008, a net liability position (265,937 ) Change in fair value, net $ (157,796 ) Realized loss resulting from net cash payments (48,135 ) Net loss on interest rate swap contracts $ (205,931 ) At December 31, 2008, the Company had an outstanding prepaid interest rate swap with a notional contract value of approximately $48,620 entered into in connection with our monetization transactions. This swap matures in 2009 and coincides with its related prepaid equity forward contract maturity. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of our prepaid interest rate swap contracts was $630, a net liability 99 Table of Contents position. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates from December 31, 2008 prevailing levels would increase our liability under these contracts by $2 to a liability of $632. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a net gain on such interest swap contracts of $248 as detailed below: Fair Value of Prepaid Interest Rate Swap Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2007, a net liability position $ (5,009 ) Change in fair value, net 4,379 Fair value as of December 31, 2008, a net liability position (630 ) Change in fair value, net $ 4,379 Realized loss resulting from net cash payments (4,131 ) Net gain on prepaid interest rate swap contracts $ 248
