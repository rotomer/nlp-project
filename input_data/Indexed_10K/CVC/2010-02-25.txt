Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including capital market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. Continued capital and credit market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services and entertainment, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers inability to pay for the services we provide. We have experienced some of the effects of this economic downturn. Continuation of events such as these may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Telecommunications Services Our Telecommunications Services segment, which accounted for 70% of our consolidated revenues, net of intersegment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, derives revenues principally through monthly charges to subscribers of our video, high speed data and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services and its commercial data and voice services operations (Optimum Lightpath). These monthly charges include fees for cable television programming, high speed data and voice services, as well as, equipment rental, pay per view and video on demand. Revenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers to these services, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe, and acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers. Our ability to increase the number of subscribers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates (the number of subscribers to our services as a percentage of homes passed). As penetration rates increase, the number of available homes to which we can market our services generally decreases, which may contribute to a slower rate of customer and revenue growth in future periods. We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems. Programming costs are the most significant part of our operating expenses and are expected to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and additional service offerings. Our cable television video services, which accounted for 41% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, face competition from incumbent telephone companies and DBS service providers. As discussed in greater detail below, we face intense competition from incumbent telephone companies, Verizon and AT&T, which offer video programming in addition to their voice and high speed Internet access services, evidencing their commitment to compete across all of the Companys telecommunications products. To the extent the incumbent telephone companies, who have financial resources that exceed ours, decide to meet our pricing and or features or reduce their pricing, our future growth may be negatively impacted. There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have. We compete with these DBS competitors by bundling our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high speed data service and voice service carried over the cable distribution plant, as well as by providing interactive services that are currently unavailable to a DBS subscriber. Historically, we have made substantial investments in the development of new and innovative programming options and other product enhancements for our customers as a way of differentiating 48 Table of Contents ourselves from our competitors. We likely will continue to do so in order to remain an effective competitor, which could increase our operating expenses and capital expenditures. Verizon and AT&T offer video programming as well as voice and high speed Internet access services to residential customers in our service area. Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our service area (currently about one third of the households according to our estimates). Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey, in numerous local franchises in New York and in all of New York City. Verizon has so far not indicated any plans to offer video service in Connecticut. AT&T offers such service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area. Competition from incumbent telephone companies has contributed to slower video revenue growth rates in 2009 and this competition may continue to negatively impact our video revenue and our video revenue growth rates in the future. Our high speed data services business, which accounted for 15% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, faces intense competition from other providers of high speed Internet access, including Verizon and AT&T. Our growth rate in high speed data customers and revenues has slowed from the growth rates we have experienced in the past due to our high penetration (53.2% of homes passed at December 31, 2009). Growth rates have also been negatively impacted, although to a lesser extent, by intensifying competition. Accordingly, the growth rate of both customers and revenues may continue to slow in the future. Our VoIP offering, which accounted for 10% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, faces intense competition from other providers of voice services, including carriers such as Verizon and AT&T. We compete primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited United States, Canada and Puerto Rico long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price. Our growth rate in VoIP customers and revenues has slowed from the growth rates we have experienced in the past due to our increasing penetration (42.5% of homes passed at December 31, 2009). Growth rates have also been negatively impacted, although to a lesser extent, by intensifying competition. Accordingly, the growth rate of both customers and revenues may continue to slow in the future. The regulatory framework for high speed data service and voice service is being developed and changes in how we, and our competitors, are regulated, including increased regulation, may affect our competitive position. In October 2009, the FCC proposed so called net neutrality rules that could affect the terms and conditions under which we operate our high speed data service and manage our broadband network. We cannot predict whether or when the FCC will adopt such rules, the final form of any such rules, or whether they could have a material adverse effect on our high speed data service or other businesses. The Telecommunications Services segment advertising and other revenues accounted for 1% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Optimum Lightpath, which accounted for 3% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies incumbent local exchange companies such as Verizon and AT&T, other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies. To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of our Optimum Lightpath business may be negatively impacted. The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless data medium. This trend could also negatively impact the future growth of Optimum Lightpath if it were to accelerate. 49 Table of Contents Rainbow In our Rainbow segment, which accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, we earn revenues in two principal ways. First, we receive affiliation payments from cable television system operators (including our cable television systems), DBS operators and telephone companies (collectively referred to as operators). These revenues are generally earned on a per subscriber basis under multi year contracts with those operators referred to as affiliation agreements. The specific affiliation fee revenues we earn vary from period to period, operator to operator and also vary among our networks, but are generally based upon the number of each operators subscribers who receive our programming, referred to as viewing subscribers, or are a fixed contractual monthly fee. The second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising. Under our affiliation agreements, we have the right to sell a specific amount of national advertising time on our programming networks. Our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliation fee revenues because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis, not under long term contracts. Also, most of our advertising revenues vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services. We seek to grow our revenues in the Rainbow segment by increasing the number of operators that carry our services and the number of viewing subscribers. We refer to this as our penetration. AMC, which is widely distributed, has less ability to increase its penetration than our less penetrated services. Our revenues may also increase over time through contractual rate increases stipulated in certain of our affiliation agreements. In negotiating for increased or extended carriage, we may be subject to requests by operators to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers or extended carriage, which we record as deferred carriage fees and which are amortized as a reduction to revenue over the period of the related affiliation agreements, or to waive for a specified period or accept lower per subscriber fees if certain additional subscribers are provided. We also may help fund the operators efforts to market our channels. As we continue our efforts to add subscribers, our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees (deferred carriage), discounted subscriber fees and other payments; however, we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period. We seek to increase our advertising revenues by increasing the number of minutes of national advertising sold and by increasing the rates we charge for such advertising, but, ultimately, the level of our advertising revenues, in most cases, is directly related to the overall distribution of our programming, penetration of our services, and the popularity (including within desirable demographic groups) of our services as measured by rating services. Our principal goals in this segment are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our national services. To do this, we must continue to contract for and produce high quality, attractive programming. One of our greatest challenges arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few operators, creating disparate bargaining power between the largest operators and us. This increased concentration could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration. In addition, this concentration gives those operators greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements. Moreover, as a result of this concentration, the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would have a significant adverse impact on this segment. Madison Square Garden Our Madison Square Garden segment accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues, net of intersegment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009. On February 9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden, a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses 50 Table of Contents previously owned and operated by the Companys Madison Square Garden segment. The MSG Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of Madison Square Garden Class A Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group Class A Common Stock held of record on the Record Date and one share of Madison Square Garden Class B Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group Class B Common Stock held of record on the Record Date. Through December 31, 2009, we have reflected the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden in our consolidated financial statements within continuing operations. For the periods following the MSG Distribution, we will not consolidate the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of our own financial reporting. After the date of the MSG Distribution, the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden will be reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date beginning with the financial statements to be filed for the quarter ending March 31, 2010. Newsday Newsday, which accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2009, consists of the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com. Newsday also included Island Publications, which was shutdown in December 2008. Since Newsdays acquisition on July 29, 2008, it has experienced a decline in consolidated revenues and operating income, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to decreased advertising revenues. The decrease in advertising revenues has resulted from the current economic environment and increased competition for advertising dollars from other media, particularly the Internet. This decline has continued into 2009 and is expected to continue into 2010. Newsdays revenue is derived primarily from the sale of advertising and the sale of newspapers (circulation revenue). For the year ended December 31, 2009, advertising revenues accounted for 76% of the total revenues of Newsday. Newsdays business model is largely dependent on advertising revenue. Advertising revenue is derived from printed ads that run in the newspaper, preprinted advertisements that are inserted into the newspaper, and preprinted sticky notes that are applied to the front of the paper. In addition, advertising revenue also includes online advertising consisting of banner ads, video ads, floating ads, expanding ads, search engine advertising and online classified advertising for auto, recruitment and real estate. Local economic conditions affect the levels of retail and classified newspaper advertising revenue. General economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, readership and circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising. All of these factors, along with the competitive and seasonal factors discussed below, contributed to a challenging advertising sales environment in 2008 and 2009 and have adversely impacted and are expected to adversely impact our ability to maintain our advertising revenues. Newsdays advertising categories most adversely impacted by the recent economic downturn include: the real estate, automotive, and help wanted classified advertising categories; the financial services category within national advertising; and the home improvement and department store categories within retail advertising. Additionally, in December 2009, Newsday ceased the publishing of certain unprofitable shopper publications serving the boroughs of New York City. Seasonal variations in consumer spending have historically caused quarterly advertising revenues to fluctuate. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenues have historically been higher than first and third quarter advertising revenues, reflecting the historically slower economic activity in the winter and summer and the stronger fourth quarter holiday season. The level of advertising sales in any period may also be affected by advertisers decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to actual or anticipated consumer demand and general economic conditions. 51 Table of Contents The economic downturn in the newspaper industry intensified in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued through 2009 as indicated by a number of newspapers that ceased operations and or filed for federal bankruptcy protection. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Newsday experienced a significant decline in advertising revenues and operating income as compared to the comparable period in 2008. A continuing economic downturn or continuing decline in advertising and or circulation revenue would have a material adverse effect on Newsdays future consolidated revenues, earnings and operating cash flows. If Newsdays results deteriorate further, it would adversely affect the Companys consolidated revenues, earnings and operating cash flows causing possible additional impairments of certain of its indefinite lived trademarks. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Demand for advertising, increased competition and declines in circulation affect our Newsday business. For the year ended December 31, 2009, circulation revenues accounted for approximately 22% of the total revenues of Newsday. Newsdays circulation revenue is derived primarily from home delivery subscriptions of the Newsday daily newspaper, and single copy sales of Newsday at the newsstand or through local retail outlets. Approximately 69% of the circulation revenues were derived from subscription sales, which provide readers with the convenience of home delivery, and are an important component of Newsdays circulation base. For the year ended December 31, 2009, single copy rates for Newsday ranged from $0.50 to $1.00 per daily copy and $1.25 to $2.50 per Sunday copy. These prices reflect Newsdays most recent price increases to $1.00 per daily copy and $2.50 per Sunday copy initiated in the fourth quarter of 2009. These price increases could have a negative impact on Newsdays circulation copy volume. Newsdays single copy sales comprised approximately 31% of circulation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. In recent years, circulation has generally declined throughout the newspaper industry, and Newsdays newspapers have generally experienced this trend. A decrease in home delivery subscriptions and single copy sales of newspapers could adversely impact circulation revenue as well as advertising revenue. In October 2009, Newsday transitioned to a subscriber access model for a substantial portion of its newsday.com websites content. The website is available for no additional charge to Newsday subscribers and to Optimum Online customers. Newsday Expenses The basic material used in publishing newspapers is newsprint. Management believes Newsdays source of newsprint, along with available alternate sources, is adequate for its current needs. Newsdays largest categories of operating expenses relate to the production and distribution of its print products. These costs are driven by volume (number of newspapers printed and number of pages printed) and the number of pages printed are impacted by the volume of advertising page counts. Certain other Newsday expenses fluctuate directly with advertising sales. The expense that is most directly linked to advertising sales is sales commissions, which represents a relatively small percentage of Newsdays operating expenses. The majority of Newsdays other costs, such as editorial content creation, rent and general and administrative expenses do not directly fluctuate with changes in advertising and circulation revenue. Accordingly, when advertising sales decline, there is a significant and immediate adverse impact on revenue and operating cash flows, which Newsday, and the newspaper industry in general, has experienced in the recent economic downturn. As a result of the economic deterioration, and the other factors discussed above and their impact on Newsday, including the intensified decline in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company lowered its expectations related to Newsdays anticipated revenues and operating cash flows in 2009 and future periods. These revised expectations caused the Company to evaluate whether or not an impairment had occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and that evaluation resulted in the Companys determination that it was necessary to recognize certain impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the Company recorded pre tax impairment charges of $59,522, $8,199 and $333,159 related to indefinite lived intangibles, certain long lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively, originally 52 Table of Contents recorded by the Company in conjunction with its acquisition of Newsday on July 29, 2008. These impairment charges reflect the continuing deterioration of values in the newspaper industry and the greater than anticipated economic downturn and its current and anticipated impact on Newsdays advertising business. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $2,000 impairment charge relating to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of Newsdays indefinite lived intangible trademarks. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets: The Companys long lived and indefinite lived assets at December 31, 2009 include goodwill of $1,100,702, other intangible assets of $1,677,980 ($980,856 of which are indefinite lived intangibles), $3,315,586 of property, plant and equipment and long term program rights of $525,344. Such assets accounted for approximately 71% of the Companys consolidated total assets. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets, which represent primarily the Companys cable television franchises, various trademarks and sports franchise intangibles, are tested annually for impairment during the first quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. In accordance with the guidance outlined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350 10, the Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. For the purpose of evaluating goodwill impairment, the Company has five reporting units containing approximately 92% of the Companys goodwill balance of $1,100,702. These reporting units are the Consumer Services (cable television) reporting unit in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment ($234,290), the MSG Media ($465,326), MSG Entertainment ($58,979) and MSG Sports ($218,187) reporting units in the Madison Square Garden reportable segment, which was distributed to Cablevision stockholders on February 9, 2010, and the AMC reporting units in the Rainbow reportable segment ($34,249). The impairment test for identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets reported in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009: 53 Table of Contents Reportable Segment Units of Accounting Identifiable Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Balance Telecommunications Services Cable Television Franchises $ 731,848 Madison Square Garden Sports Franchises 96,215 Radio City Related Trademarks 53,880 Chicago Theatre Trademark 8,000 Rainbow Sundance Channel Trademark 19,900 Newsday Newsday Trademarks 64,100 Telecommunications Services, Rainbow and Other Various other identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets 6,913 $ 980,856 For other long lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other long lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. For the Telecommunications Services reportable segment, these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of homes passed, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed, among other assumptions. For the Madison Square Garden (which was distributed to Cablevision stockholders on February 9, 2010) and Rainbow reportable segments, these valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers and growth in fixed price contractual arrangements used to determine affiliation fee revenue, number of events (Madison Square Garden reportable segment only), access to sports programming and program rights and the cost of such sports programming and program rights, amount of programming time that is advertiser supported, number of advertising spots available and the sell through rates for those spots, average fee per advertising spot, and operating margins, among other assumptions. For the Newsday reportable segment, these valuations also include assumptions for advertising and circulation revenue trends, operating margin, market participant synergies, and market multiples for comparable companies. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets. Based on the Companys annual impairment test during the first quarter of 2009, the Companys reporting units had significant safety margins, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit less its respective carrying value (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value calculations of the Companys reporting units on the annual impairment calculation for goodwill, the Company applied hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases to the estimated fair values of each reporting unit. These hypothetical decreases of 10%, 20% and 30% would have no impact on the goodwill impairment analysis for any of the Companys reporting units with the exception of the Sundance Channel and Clearview Cinemas reporting units. For the Sundance Channel, which had a goodwill carrying value of $28,930 at December 31, 2009, a 9% 54 Table of Contents reduction in its estimated fair value would result in a goodwill impairment test step one failure. For Clearview Cinemas, which had a goodwill carrying value of $10,348 at December 31, 2009, a 25% reduction in its estimated fair value would result in a step one failure. A step one failure would require the Company to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and, if required, the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. The Companys primary identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets that represent approximately 90% of the identifiable indefinite lived intangibles are the Companys cable television franchises, various reporting unit trademarks and sports franchises, which are valued using an income approach or market approach. The Companys cable television franchises are the largest of the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets and were recognized as a result of cable system acquisitions prior to 2002 and reflect agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. Our cable television franchises are valued using a discounted cash flows (DCF) methodology. The Companys indefinite lived trademark intangible assets primarily relate to Madison Square Gardens Radio City related trademarks (which was distributed to Cablevision stockholders on February 9, 2010), which include the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, and The Rockettes trademarks which were valued using a relief from royalty method in which the expected benefits are valued by discounting royalty revenue over projected revenues covered by the trademarks. The Companys indefinite lived sports franchises intangibles representing Madison Square Gardens NBA and NHL sports franchises (which was distributed to Cablevision stockholders on February 9, 2010) are valued using a direct valuation method based on market comparables. Both the Radio City related trademarks and the sports franchises were recorded in April 2005 when the Company acquired the remaining 40% interest in Madison Square Garden. Significant judgments inherent in a valuation include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows attributable to the cable television franchises and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the DCF analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. Based on the Companys annual impairment test during the first quarter of 2009, the Companys units of accounting that represent approximately 90% of the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets have significant safety margins, representing the excess of the identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets estimated fair value unit of accounting over their respective carrying values. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of all the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangibles, the Company applied hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases to the estimated fair value of each of the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangibles. These hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases in estimated fair value would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our identifiable indefinite lived intangibles other than the Newsday, Sundance Channel and Chicago Theatre related trademarks, which have a carrying value of $64,100, $19,900, $8,000, respectively. The hypothetical fair value decreases would have resulted in impairment charges of approximately $8,000 at 10% related primarily to the Newsday and Chicago Theatre related trademarks, approximately $16,000 at 20% related primarily to the Newsday and Chicago Theatre related trademarks and approximately $26,000 at 30% related primarily to the Newsday, the Sundance Channel and Chicago Theatre related trademarks. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Newsday indefinite lived trademarks were written down to their estimated fair values (see discussion below). The Companys impairment analysis of Newsday as of December 31, 2008 resulted in pre tax impairment charges of $59,522, $8,199 and $333,159 related to identifiable indefinite lived intangibles, certain long lived intangible assets and goodwill, respectively, originally recorded by the Company in connection with its acquisition of Newsday on July 29, 2008. The net $400,880 pre tax impairment charges recorded in 2008 are included in depreciation and amortization (including impairments) and the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $164,080. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $2,000 impairment charge relating to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of Newsdays indefinite lived intangible trademarks. 55 Table of Contents The Company determined the fair value of our Newsday reporting unit based on a weighting of the estimated fair values determined under the income approach and the market approach. The income approach utilizes a DCF valuation methodology, which requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the projected future cash flows including the cash flows generated from potential synergies a market participant may generate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including expected cash flows beyond the Companys current long term business planning period, and certain tax benefits the Company would recognize. The discount rate utilized for the interim impairment assessment was a consolidated weighted average discount rate of 12%. The market approach measures fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable publicly traded newspaper publishing companies and comparable transactions taking into consideration potential synergies a market participant may generate and requires significant judgments in determining comparable market multiples. The weighting between the income approach and market approach was weighted more towards the income approach based on our belief that the income approach was more reliable in the midst of the steep economic decline impacting the publishing industry, and in view of the fact that there were no recent observable sales transactions involving the newspaper business. The estimated fair values of Newsdays indefinite lived intangibles, which relate primarily to the trademarks associated with its newspaper mastheads, were based on discounted future cash flows calculated based on the relief from royalty method. Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. From the date of the acquisition of Newsday on July 29, 2008 through year end 2008, there was a significant decrease in the estimated fair value of the Newsday reporting unit, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. The reduction in estimated fair value under the income approach was primarily due to the decline in Newsdays projections of future revenue and cash flows. In addition, the estimated fair value under the income approach was further reduced by the increase in the consolidated weighted average discount rate for the Newsday reporting unit from approximately 10% at July 29, 2008 to 12% at December 31, 2008. The consolidated weighted average discount rate was based on an estimation of a market participants cost of equity and debt, weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt for comparable newspaper companies. The increase in the consolidated weighted average discount rate for the Newsday reporting unit from 10% to 12% was due to an increase in both the estimated cost of equity and debt, which was primarily due to the following: the market risk premium increasing from 5% to 6%; an increase in the economic volatility affecting the newspaper publishing industry, which intensified during the fourth quarter of 2008; and an increase in borrowing costs for the industry. Since the acquisition of the Newsday reporting unit on July 29, 2008, there also has been a reduction in the estimated fair value under the market approach. Approximately two thirds of this reduction was primarily due to a decline in market multiples and approximately one third of the reduction was due to a decline in Newsdays projections of future revenue and cash flows. The Company impaired 100% of its basis in the goodwill balance of the Newsday reporting unit as of December 31, 2008. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Newsday reporting unit on July 29, 2008, the reduction in estimated fair values of the trademarks under the relief from royalty method was primarily due to a reduction of the assumed royalty rate from 4% to 3% for the Newsday print newspaper and newsday.com trademarks, an increase in the discount rate for the Newsday print newspaper from 9.0% to 11.5% and a decline in the Companys revenue projections for newsday.com in comparison to the revenue projections at July 29, 2008. The primary reason for the decrease in the royalty rate from 4% to 3% was due to the lower projected margins for the Newsday print newspaper and newsday.com. The primary reason for the increase in the discount rate for the Newsday print newspaper trademark from 9.0% to 11.5% was due to an increase in both the estimated cost of equity and debt, which was primarily due to the following: the market risk premium increasing from 5% to 6%; an increase in the economic volatility affecting the newspaper publishing industry, which intensified during the fourth quarter of 2008; and an increase in borrowing costs to the industry. 56 Table of Contents Rights to programming, including feature films and episodic series, acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed, unless there is uncertainty with respect to either cost, acceptability or availability. If such uncertainty exists, those rights and obligations are recorded at the earlier of when the uncertainty is resolved or when the license period begins. Costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on a straight line basis over the respective license periods. Owned original programming is produced for us by independent production companies. Any owned original programming costs qualifying for capitalization as program rights are amortized to technical and operating expense over their estimated useful lives, commencing upon the first airing, based on attributable revenue for airings to date as a percentage of total projected attributable revenue. Projected program usage is based on the historical performance of similar content. Estimated cash flows can change based upon programming market acceptance, levels of affiliation fee revenue and advertising revenue, and program usage. Accordingly, we periodically review revenue estimates and planned usage and revise our assumptions if necessary which could impact the timing of amortization expenses or result in an impairment charge. We periodically review the programming usefulness of our program rights based on a series of factors, including ratings, type and quality of program material, standards and practices, and fitness of exhibition. If it is determined that film or other program rights have no future programming usefulness, a write off of the unamortized cost is recorded in technical and operating expense. Useful Lives of Finite Lived Intangible Assets: The Company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation agreements, affiliate relationships, broadcast rights and other agreements, advertiser relationships, season ticket holder relationships, suite holder relationships and other intangibles as a result of purchase accounting. The Company has determined that certain of such intangible assets have finite lives. The estimated useful lives and net carrying values of these intangibles at December 31, 2009 are as follows: Net Carrying Value at December 31, 2009 Estimated Useful Lives Affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships $ 495,825 4 to 25 years Broadcast rights and other agreements 4,027 10 years Season ticket holder relationships 48,628 10 to 15 years Suite holder relationships 8,749 11 years Advertiser relationships 64,017 3 to 10 years Other intangible assets 75,878 3 to 28 years The useful lives for the affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average remaining terms of existing agreements the Company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied, plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements. The Company has been successful in renewing its major affiliation agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliation agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future. However, it is possible that the Company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does, the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. In light of these facts and circumstances, the Company has determined that an estimated useful life of 4 to 10 years for affiliation agreements and 24 to 25 years for affiliate relationships is appropriate. There have been periods when an existing affiliation agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of 57 Table of Contents time. In substantially all these instances, the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewals. If an affiliate were to cease carrying the service on an other than temporary basis, the Company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliation agreement and affiliate relationship intangible asset. If the Company were to renew an affiliation agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement, the Company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and, if necessary, would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets for the asset group containing that intangible asset. The Company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliation agreement and affiliate relationship remained appropriate. Based on December 31, 2009 carrying values, if the estimated life of all affiliation agreements and affiliate relationships were shortened by 10%, the effect on amortization for the year ending December 31, 2010 would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately $8,600. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards (NOLs). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs. The Company decreased the valuation allowance by $1,427 in 2009, increased the valuation allowance by $6,602 in 2008 and decreased the valuation allowance in 2007 by $536. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, certain state NOLs expired prior to utilization. The deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired NOLs had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $3,609, $2,681 and $1,122 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. To address state income tax planning considerations, certain subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies during 2009. Certain state NOLs, for which the related deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance, were eliminated pursuant to such conversions. Accordingly, the associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $9,355. Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Companys cable television system, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Companys hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (10 to 25 years) and headend facilities (4 to 15 years). Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to connect businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the infrastructure or digital platform are also capitalized. These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor to connect, provision and provide on site and remote technical assistance and other related 58 Table of Contents costs associated with the connection activities. In addition, on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. New connections are amortized over 5 years or 12 years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home, respectively. The portion of departmental costs related to reconnection, programming service up and down grade, repair and maintenance, and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred. Certain Transactions The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2008 Transactions.

The net operating results of Fox Sports Net Bay Area have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The net operating results of Fox Sports Net Bay Area were previously reported in the Rainbow segment. On May 2, 2007, Cablevision entered into a merger agreement with Central Park Holding Company, LLC (Dolan Family Acquisition Company), an entity owned by the Dolan Family Group, and Central Park Merger Sub, Inc.

Cablevision Systems Corporation Through December 31, 2009, the Company classified its business interests into four reportable segments: Telecommunications Services, consisting principally of our video, high speed data, VoIP services and the commercial data and voice services operations of Optimum Lightpath; Rainbow, consisting principally of interests in national and regional television programming networks, including AMC, WE tv, IFC, Sundance Channel (since June 16, 2008), News 12, IFC Entertainment, and the VOOM HD Networks (the U.S. domestic programming of which ceased in January 2009); Madison Square Garden, consisting principally of sports, entertainment and media businesses; and Newsday (since July 29, 2008), consisting of the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com. On February 9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden, a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses previously owned and operated by the Companys Madison Square Garden segment. The MSG Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of Madison Square Garden Class A Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group Class A Common Stock held of record on the Record Date and one share of Madison Square Garden Class B Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group Class B Common Stock held of record on the Record Date. Through December 31, 2009, we have reflected the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden in our consolidated financial statements within continuing operations. For the periods following the MSG Distribution, we will not consolidate the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of our own financial reporting. After the date of the MSG Distribution, the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden will be reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date beginning with the financial statements to be filed for the quarter ending March 31, 2010. The Company allocates certain amounts of its corporate overhead to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services, except for Newsday as to which the Company allocated the incremental costs incurred in providing these services through September 30, 2009. Subsequent to September 30, 2009, the Company allocated certain amounts of its corporate overhead to Newsday based upon its proportionate estimated usage of such services. The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect inter segment eliminations unless specifically indicated. See Business Segments Results for a discussion relating to the operating results of our segments. 62 Table of Contents Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $543,160 (8%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunication Services segment $ 266,133 Increase in revenues of the Rainbow segment, including revenues attributable to Sundance Channel acquired in June 2008 63,234 Increase in revenues of the Madison Square Garden segment 19,459 Increase in revenues of the Newsday segment (acquired July 29, 2008) 161,739 Other net increases 5,228 Inter segment eliminations 27,367 $ 543,160 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) include primarily: cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis; network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections; contractual rights expense to broadcast certain live sporting events and contractual compensation expense pursuant to employment agreements with professional sports teams personnel; amortization of costs to license programming, including program rights, and distribution and production related costs of our Rainbow and Madison Square Garden segments; interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers; and publication production and distribution costs of our Newsday segment. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) in 2009 increased $124,659 (4%) as compared to 2008. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 25,701 Decrease in expenses of the Rainbow segment, including expenses attributable to Sundance Channel subsequent to acquisition in June 2008 (5,243 ) Decrease in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment (42,560 ) Increase in expenses of the Newsday segment (acquired July 29, 2008) 99,633 Other net increases 15,840 Inter segment eliminations 31,288 $ 124,659 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 2% during 2009 as compared to 2008. 63 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $154,602 (9%) for 2009 as compared to 2008. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 55,971 Increase in expenses of the Rainbow segment, including expenses attributable to Sundance subsequent to acquisition in June 2008 11,362 Increase in expenses of the Madison Square Garden segment 1,195 Increase in expenses of the Newsday segment (acquired July 29, 2008) 59,466 Other net increases 30,530 Inter segment eliminations (3,922 ) $ 154,602 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2009 compared to 2008. Restructuring expense amounted to $10,728 in 2009 and $49,883 in 2008. The 2009 amount consisted of $5,162 resulting primarily from the Companys decision to discontinue the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM and charges of $6,496 relating to severance and other restructuring expenses recognized by our Newsday segment, partially offset by net credits of $(930) primarily relating to adjustments to facility realignment provisions recorded in connection with prior restructuring plans. The 2008 amount primarily included the impairment of program rights of $40,974 and employee severance and other costs of $5,821 due to the Companys decision to discontinue the U.S. programming business of VOOM and $7,225 primarily relating to severance and other restructuring charges recognized by our Newsday segment. Partially offsetting these charges were net credits of $4,137 primarily associated with adjustments to facility realignment provisions and other costs recorded in connection with the 2001, 2002 and 2006 restructuring plans. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) decreased $423,561 for 2009 as compared to 2008. In 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $400,880 related to indefinite lived intangibles, certain long lived intangible assets and goodwill at our Newsday segment and a $15,034 write off of deferred carriage fees at VOOM after EchoStar ceased the distribution of VOOM in May 2008. Additionally, the net decrease consisted of a $36,986 decrease resulting primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciation of new asset purchases and increases resulting from the Newsday transaction of $13,516 (including impairment charges of $2,790 in 2009) and the acquisition of the Sundance Channel of $15,823. Adjusted operating cash flow increased $281,089 (12%) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008. The increase is attributable to the following: Increase in AOCF of the Telecommunication Services segment $ 192,084 Increase in AOCF of the Rainbow segment, including AOCF attributable to Sundance acquired in June 2008 63,014 Increase in AOCF of the Madison Square Garden segment 62,354 Increase in AOCF of the Newsday segment (acquired July 29, 2008) 3,009 Other net decreases, primarily costs related to the MSG Distribution and costs associated with the MSG Varsity network launched in 2009 (39,372 ) $ 281,089 64 Table of Contents Interest expense, net decreased $36,236 (5%) during 2009 compared to 2008. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease due to lower average interest rates on our indebtedness $ (88,618 ) Net increase due to increase in average debt balances 35,593 Lower interest income 7,209 Other net increases 9,580 $ (36,236 ) See Liquidity and Capital Resources discussion below for a detail of our various borrower groups. Gain on sale of programming and affiliate interests, net of $2,130 and $805 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulted from the sale of our ownership interests in Sportskool and Lifeskool, which is being recorded under the installment sales method. Loss on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $981 and $136,414, respectively. The 2009 amount consists primarily of the decrease in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company and the unrealized and realized net loss associated with various other investments. The 2008 amount consists primarily of the net increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast common stock and General Electric common stock owned by the Company through the disposition of this stock in June 2008 and the unrealized and realized net loss of various other investments. The effects of these gains and losses are partially offset by the losses and gains on related equity derivative contracts, net described below. Gain on equity derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $631 and $118,219, respectively, consists of unrealized and realized gains due to the change in fair value of the Companys equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company during 2009 and 2008 and the General Electric common stock owned by the Company through the disposition of this stock in June 2008. The effects of these gains are partially offset by the losses on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in loss on investments, net discussed above. Loss on interest rate swap contracts, net amounted to $78,868 and $205,683 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. The losses on interest rate swap contracts are a result of a shift in the yield curve over the life of the swap contracts. Write off of deferred financing costs of $3,864 for the year ended December 31, 2009 represents costs written off in connection with the repurchase, prior to their maturity, of a portion of Cablevisions senior notes due April 2009, CSC Holdings senior notes due July 2009 and August 2009 and the repurchase of a portion of CSC Holdings senior notes due April 2011 and April 2012 pursuant to tender offers. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $69,593 for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted from tender premiums, fees and the write off of unamortized discounts associated with the repurchase of a portion of Cablevisions senior notes due April 2009 and CSC Holdings senior notes due July 2009, August 2009, April 2011, and April 2012 pursuant to our tender offers. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $2,424 for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted from the repayment of the Companys collateralized indebtedness relating to its holdings of shares of General Electric common stock during the second quarter of 2008. Net miscellaneous income of $2,734 and $1,264 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, resulted primarily from dividends received on certain of the Companys investment securities, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. 65 Table of Contents Income tax expense attributable to continuing operations of $235,702 for the year ended December 31, 2009 resulted primarily from the Companys pretax income, state income tax expense of $37,034, tax benefit of $6,126 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes, tax expense of $3,009, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions, a decrease in the valuation allowance of $1,427 relating to certain state NOLs and the tax impact of non deductible officers compensation and other non deductible expenses of $7,264 and $5,296, respectively. To address state income tax planning considerations, during 2009 certain subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies. In connection with such conversions, the Company recorded tax expense of $9,095 relating to the elimination of certain state NOLs and credit carry forwards. Income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $83,028 for the year ended December 31, 2008 resulted primarily from the Companys pretax loss, state income tax expense of $15,708, tax benefit of $8,670 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes, tax expense of $2,694, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions, an increase in the valuation allowance of $6,602 relating to certain state NOLs and the tax impact of non deductible officers compensation and other non deductible expenses of $5,934 and $2,640, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company has fully offset federal taxable income with a net operating loss deduction. However, the Company is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and certain state and local income taxes that are payable quarterly. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $273 and $8,108, respectively, represent other parties share of the net losses of entities which are not entirely owned by us but which are consolidated in our financial statements. 66 Table of Contents Business Segments Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for our Telecommunications Services segment: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) in % of Net % of Net Operating Amount Revenues Amount Revenues Income Revenues, net $ 5,431,500 100 % $ 5,165,367 100 % $ 266,133 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) 2,199,996 41 2,174,295 42 (25,701 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,034,284 19 978,313 19 (55,971 ) Depreciation and amortization 856,919 16 890,912 17 33,993 Operating income $ 1,340,301 25 % $ 1,121,847 22 % $ 218,454 The following is a reconciliation of operating income to AOCF: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) in Amount Amount AOCF Operating income $ 1,340,301 $ 1,121,847 $ 218,454 Share based compensation 30,748 23,125 7,623 Depreciation and amortization 856,919 890,912 (33,993 ) AOCF $ 2,227,968 $ 2,035,884 $ 192,084 67 Table of Contents Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $266,133 (5%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Percent Years Ended December 31, Increase Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) (Decrease) Video (including analog, digital, pay per view, video on demand and digital video recorder) $ 3,080,078 $ 2,961,421 $ 118,657 4 % High speed data 1,146,789 1,099,634 47,155 4 Voice 771,236 685,643 85,593 12 Advertising 105,633 115,574 (9,941 ) (9 ) Other (including installation, home shopping, advertising sales commissions, and other products) 94,066 98,736 (4,670 ) (5 ) Total cable television 5,197,802 4,961,008 236,794 5 Optimum Lightpath 255,549 248,776 6,773 3 Intra segment eliminations (21,851 ) (44,417 ) 22,566 51 Total Telecommunications Services $ 5,431,500 $ 5,165,367 $ 266,133 5 % Revenue increases reflected above are primarily derived from higher rates (primarily due to an increase of video rates of 3.5% on average, which was implemented beginning in December 2008), increases in the number of subscribers to our high speed data and voice services, including additional services sold to our existing video subscribers, upgrades by video customers from the level of the programming package to which they subscribe, and acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers, offset in part by offer discounts and other rate changes. As a result, our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the three months ended December 31, 2009 was $144.03 as compared to $134.85 and $141.03 for the three months ended December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively. We believe the decline in advertising revenue is primarily due to the impact of the economic downturn, which may continue. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services and the acquisition of 4Connections LLC in October 2008, partially offset by reduced traditional data services and lower intra segment revenue. The decrease in intra segment eliminations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year includes a reduction of interconnection costs charged to Optimum Lightpath and passed through to Optimum Voice of approximately $6,835 resulting from the resolution of certain disputed amounts between Optimum Lightpath and a third party vendor. Additionally, Optimum Voice is purchasing fewer services from Optimum Lightpath resulting from certain operational functions now being performed directly within cable operations. The following table presents certain subscriber and revenue generating units (RGUs) information as of December 31, 2009, September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008 for the Companys cable television systems (excluding Optimum Lightpath): As of December 31, 2009 As of September 30, 2009 As of December 31, 2008 (in thousands) Basic video customers 3,063 3,066 3,108 iO digital video customers 2,893 2,888 2,837 Optimum Online high speed data customers 2,568 2,522 2,455 Optimum voice customers 2,052 2,001 1,878 Total revenue generating units 10,576 10,477 10,278 68 Table of Contents The Company had a loss of 45,100 basic video customers for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to a loss of 14,900 in 2008. This is primarily due to the impact of the current economic downturn, and, to a lesser extent, intensifying competition, particularly from Verizon. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company added 297,700 RGUs as compared to 653,400 in 2008. These additions include increases in iO digital video customers resulting from digital migration initiatives that eliminated the duplicate analog feeds of various channels carried in digital of approximately 50,600 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to 93,800 in 2008. The growth in RGU additions slowed compared to the comparable period in 2008 as a result of the Companys relatively high penetration rates, the current economic downturn and, to a lesser extent, the effects of intensifying competition, particularly from Verizon. The severity and length of the economic downturn, along with intensifying competition, could impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for 2009 increased $25,701 (1%) as compared to 2008. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in field operations and network related costs primarily due to growth in RGUs, lower capitalizable activities and general cost increases $ 54,313 Increase in franchise fees due to increase in video revenues and higher rates in certain regions 6,253 Decrease in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) primarily due to the termination of carriage of VOOMs programming in January 2009 and lower subscribers to certain tiers of service, partially offset by rate increases and new program offerings (1,601 ) Decrease in call completion and interconnection costs, taxes and fees (net of related intra segment eliminations) primarily due to legislative changes in 2009 which clarified the applicability of certain fees on VoIP of $23,818, of which $19,530 related to the reversal of fees accrued in prior periods, the favorable resolution of certain disputed interconnection costs of approximately $8,555, of which $6,458 related to the reversal of costs accrued in prior periods, and lower rates, partially offset by higher volume due to increased voice customers and other fees (33,542 ) Intra segment eliminations 278 $ 25,701 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 1% during 2009 as compared to 2008. Technical and operating expenses consist primarily of programming costs and direct costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers. These costs typically rise as the number of RGUs grow and also due to general inflationary cost increases for employees, contractors, programming rates and other various expenses. Costs of field operations also increase as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize decreases due to lower new customer installations and lower new service upgrades. Network related costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes. Franchise fees are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue, primarily video revenue which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. We expect that our technical and operating expenses will continue to increase in the future. However, as a percentage of revenues, we expect these costs to remain relatively constant. Effective January 1, 2010, a new long term affiliation agreement was entered into between Cablevision and the MSG networks, which are owned by Madison Square Garden. This new long term affiliation agreement will result in estimated incremental programming costs to the Company of approximately $30,000 for 2010, as compared to the amount of programming costs recognized by the Company pursuant to the Companys arrangement with Madison Square Garden for 2009, and other additional consideration. This new affiliation agreement will provide for the carriage of the MSG Network and MSG Plus program services on Cablevisions cable systems in the tri state area. This agreement has a term of 10 years, obligates the Company to carry such program services on its cable systems and provides for the payment 69 Table of Contents by the Company to the MSG networks of a per subscriber license fee, which fee is increased each year during the term of the agreement. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $55,971 (6%) for 2009 as compared to 2008. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs primarily due to higher employee related costs $ 30,318 Favorable resolution of litigation that resulted in a reversal of expenses accrued in prior periods (5,579 ) Increase in customer related costs primarily due to higher RGUs and general cost increases 18,427 Increase in share based compensation expense and expenses relating to Cablevisions long term incentive plans 7,113 Increase in other general and administrative costs, primarily due to general cost increases, partially offset by severance charges of $2,347 in the first quarter of 2008 5,303 Intra segment eliminations 389 $ 55,971 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained essentially constant in 2009 as compared to 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses include customer related costs, principally from the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities. These costs generally rise as the number of RGUs grow and also as a result of general inflationary cost increases for employees and other various expenses. We expect that our customer related costs will continue to increase in relatively the same proportion as increases in RGUs and general inflationary cost increases. Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of employee costs and advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs may continue to increase as competition continues to intensify. Depreciation and amortization decreased $33,993 (4%) for 2009 as compared to 2008. The net decrease resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciation of new asset purchases. Adjusted operating cash flow increased $192,084 (9%) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase was due primarily to an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share based compensation, as discussed above. 70 Table of Contents Rainbow The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for our Rainbow segment.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the operating losses from Rainbows other services were attributable primarily to News 12 Networks and, to a lesser extent, VOOM and RASCO. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the operating losses from Rainbows other services were attributable primarily to VOOM, News 12 Networks and, to a lesser extent, IFC Entertainment and RASCO. 71 Table of Contents In January 2009, the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM was shut down. This decision had a favorable impact on the operating income of our Rainbow segment of $76,760 for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 as the loss of revenues from our VOOM business was more than offset by the elimination of most operating expenses of VOOM. The 2009 operating expenses included restructuring expenses of $5,162 as compared to $46,795 for the same period in the prior year. Currently, certain of the VOOM programming continues to be distributed internationally. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $63,234 (6%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Net increase in affiliation fee revenues and advertising/sponsorship revenues primarily from Sundance Channel (acquired June 2008) and, to a lesser extent, distribution revenues from IFC Entertainment, partially offset by a decrease in affiliation fee revenues following the sale of Lifeskool (October 2008) and Sportskool (September 2008) and a decrease in advertising revenues at News 12 Networks and RASCO $ 40,822 Increase in affiliation fee revenues and other revenues at AMC, WE tv and IFC resulting primarily from increases in affiliation rates and in viewing subscribers (see table below) 38,465 Increase in advertising revenues at AMC, WE tv and IFC due to higher units sold at AMC and improved program ratings at WE tv 35,466 Decrease in revenues, net due to the Companys decision in December 2008 to discontinue the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM (January 2009) (51,519 ) $ 63,234 The decrease in revenues of VOOM was due primarily to the loss of EchoStars carriage in May 2008 and the loss of carriage by Cablevision effective January 20, 2009. Revenue increases discussed above are primarily derived from increases in the level of advertising on our networks and increases in affiliation fee revenues derived from affiliation rates charged for our services and in the number of viewing subscribers. The following table presents certain viewing subscriber information at December 31, 2009 and 2008: As of December 31, 2009 2008 Viewing Subscribers: AMC 87,700 86,100 WE tv 62,500 61,000 IFC 50,100 48,900 Sundance Channel 37,900 30,800 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization and impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $5,243 (1%) compared to 2008. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in programming costs at VOOM due to the Companys decision in December 2008 to discontinue funding the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM in January 2009 $ (54,892 ) Increase in programming costs primarily at AMC and WE tv and, to a lesser extent, IFC due to increased amortization of non film program rights at AMC and WE tv 35,793 Net increase in programming costs at Rainbows other services (excluding VOOM) resulting primarily from an increase in programming costs of Sundance Channel (acquired June 2008) and IFC Entertainment 13,856 $ (5,243 ) As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 3% during 2009 as compared to 2008 due primarily to the decrease in programming costs at VOOM as noted above. 72 Table of Contents There may be significant changes in the level of our technical and operating expenses from quarter to quarter and or changes from year to year due to content acquisition and or original programming costs. As additional competition for content increases from other programming services and alternate distribution technologies continue to develop in the industry, costs for content acquisition and or original programming may increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11,362 (3%) for 2009 compared to 2008. The net increase is attributable to the following: Net increase in selling, marketing and advertising costs at Rainbows other programming services (excluding VOOM) primarily related to marketing and promotional activities of the Sundance Channel (acquired June 2008) $ 12,606 Net increase in administrative costs due primarily to the increase in parent company allocations, and to a lesser extent management fees at AMC and WE tv paid to CSC Holdings resulting from increased revenues, partially offset by a decrease in administrative costs following the sale of Lifeskool (October 2008) and Sportskool (September 2008) 6,756 Decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses at VOOM due to the Companys decision in December 2008 to discontinue funding the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM in January 2009 (12,815 ) Net decrease in selling and marketing costs at AMC, WE tv and IFC related to a decrease in costs for the marketing and promotion of original programming, partially offset by an increase in advertising sales related expenses at AMC and WE tv resulting from increased advertising sales revenue (1,194 ) Increase in share based compensation expense and expenses relating to Cablevisions long term incentive plans 6,009 $ 11,362 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2% in 2009 compared to 2008. There may be significant changes in the level of our selling, general and administrative expenses from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the timing of promotion and marketing of original programming and the number of premieres that occur during a quarter. Restructuring expense of $5,145 for the year ended December 31, 2009 represents primarily the additional impairment of program rights and contract termination costs due to the Companys decision to discontinue funding the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM and the decision in 2009 to discontinue certain international VOOM programming. Restructuring expense of $46,834 for the year ended December 31, 2008 represents primarily the impairment of program rights of $40,974 and employee severance and other costs of $5,821 due to the Companys decision to discontinue the U.S. programming of VOOM. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) decreased $881 (less than 1%) in 2009 as compared to 2008. Amortization expense (including impairments) decreased $1,480 for 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a $15,034 write off of deferred carriage fees at VOOM HD Networks after EchoStar ceased the distribution of VOOM in May 2008 and a decrease in amortization expense of $1,499 due to certain amortizable identifiable intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by an increase of $15,053 due to the increase in amortization of identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of the Sundance Channel in June 2008. The decrease in amortization expense was offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $599 in 2009 as compared to 2008. 73 Table of Contents Adjusted operating cash flow increased $63,014 in 2009 compared to 2008 due to an increase in revenues, net of $63,234, partially offset by an insignificant increase in operating expenses, excluding share based compensation, restructuring and depreciation and amortization expenses, as discussed above. Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for the Companys Madison Square Garden segment. Year Ended December 31, Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) in Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Operating Income Revenues, net $ 1,062,417 100 % $ 1,042,958 100 % $ 19,459 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) 681,906 64 724,466 69 42,560 Selling, general and administrative expenses 271,429 26 270,234 26 (1,195 ) Depreciation and amortization 61,336 6 66,277 6 4,941 Operating income (loss) $ 47,746 4 % $ (18,019 ) (2 )% $ 65,765 The following is a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to AOCF: Years Ended December 31, Increase 2009 2008 (Decrease) in Amount Amount AOCF Operating income (loss) $ 47,746 $ (18,019 ) $ 65,765 Share based compensation 14,262 12,732 1,530 Depreciation and amortization 61,336 66,277 (4,941 ) AOCF $ 123,344 $ 60,990 $ 62,354 The dependence of this segments revenues on its sports teams and Christmas shows generally make it seasonal with a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income being derived in the fourth quarter of each year. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $19,459 (2%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. This net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in network affiliation fee revenue, primarily from third parties $ 42,134 Decrease in revenues from entertainment events (21,454 ) Decrease in team and other live sporting event revenues (3,393 ) Other net increases 2,172 $ 19,459 The increase in network affiliation fee revenue for year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increases in contractual affiliation rates and higher subscriber counts. 74 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2010, a new long term affiliation agreement was entered into between Cablevision and the MSG networks. This new long term affiliation agreement will result in estimated incremental revenues provided to Madison Square Garden of approximately $30,000 for 2010, as compared to the amount recognized pursuant to Madison Square Gardens arrangement with Cablevision for 2009, and other additional consideration. This new affiliation agreement will provide for the carriage of the MSG Network and MSG Plus programming services on Cablevisions cable systems in the tri state area. This agreement has a term of 10 years, obligates the Company to carry such program services on its cable systems and provides for the payment by the Company to the MSG networks of a per subscriber license fee, which fee is increased each year during the term of the agreement. Revenues from entertainment events for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased from the prior year primarily due to fewer entertainment events in the Madison Square Garden arena (the Arena) and, individually, to a lesser extent, lower revenues from the presentation of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall and the winter themed production, Wintuk. These declines were offset in part by an increase in revenues resulting primarily from a higher number of events at the Beacon Theatre, which was shut down the last five months of 2008 during its restoration, higher revenues from the Radio City Christmas Spectacular touring shows theater presentations, as well as a new production first presented in 2009, Banana Shpeel. Team and other live sporting event revenues decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year primarily from a decrease in sports teams playoff related revenues, revenues from other live sporting events, primarily boxing events, and suite revenues. These decreases were partially offset by higher sports teams regular season ticket related revenue due primarily to higher average ticket prices. Madison Square Gardens revenues are highly dependent on its customers discretionary entertainment spending. In addition, its entertainment business is dependent on the number of events presented in its venues by Madison Square Garden and by third parties. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Madison Square Garden saw a reduction in the renewal of certain of its suite licenses, a lower level of Arena event bookings, and lower attendance at the presentation of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall reflecting the current economic environment. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $42,560 (6%) as compared to the prior year. This decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in net provisions for certain team personnel transactions (including the impact of NBA luxury tax) $ (16,887 ) Decrease in network operating costs, primarily from lower levels of production costs (12,918 ) Decrease due to lower net provision for NBA luxury tax (excluding the impact of certain team personnel transactions described above) of $7,948 and lower net provision for NHL revenue sharing (excluding playoffs) of $3,512 (11,460 ) Decrease in expenses associated with other live sporting events (8,947 ) Higher non event related venue operating costs including the impact of a new venue booking agreement for the Wang Theatre 5,480 Increase in variable costs associated with entertainment events 1,610 Other net increases, including higher team personnel compensation which was substantially offset by $4,838 in insurance recoveries related to a non season ending player injury in 2009 562 $ (42,560 ) Team personnel transactions for the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily reflect provisions recorded for player waivers and the costs associated with a player trade of $5,169 and $3,286, respectively. Team personnel transactions for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily reflect provisions recorded for career ending and season ending player injuries of $20,952, which is net of anticipated insurance recoveries of $11,935, as well as player waivers of $3,226. 75 Table of Contents The change in the net provisions for NBA luxury tax (excluding the impact of certain team personnel transactions described above) and NHL revenue sharing (excluding playoffs) for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year reflects a lower net provision for NBA luxury tax, based primarily on the Knicks estimated season ending team salaries subject to the tax and a lower net provision for NHL revenue sharing expense, based primarily on estimates of the Rangers and league wide season ending revenues. The lower expenses associated with other live sporting events for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year primarily reflects the absence of costs associated with a large scale boxing event such as was held in 2008. Variable costs associated with entertainment events increased for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in costs, resulting primarily from a higher number of events at the Beacon Theatre which was shut down the last five months of 2008 during its restoration, as well as the costs associated with a new production first presented in 2009, Banana Shpeel. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in costs resulting primarily from fewer entertainment events in the Arena. As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 5% during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $1,195 as compared to the prior year. This increase is attributable to the following: Decrease in legal and other professional fees, primarily due to the settlement of the litigation with the NHL in the first quarter of 2009 $ (31,228 ) Decrease in marketing costs, primarily at the networks (8,622 ) Increase in severance provisions, primarily due to a separation agreement with a team executive entered into in the second quarter of 2009 19,966 Increase in employee salaries and related benefits, primarily due to the impact of salary increases and additions to staff 18,014 Other net increases 3,065 $ 1,195 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant during the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $4,941 (7%) as compared to the prior year mainly due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the first quarter of 2009. Adjusted operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased $62,354 (102%) as compared to the prior year.

These expenses amounted to $22,220 (12% of revenues, net) for the period July 30, 2008 through December 31, 2008. During the second quarter of 2009, Newsday completed its web width reduction project to reduce the size of the Newsday and amNewYork newspapers and as a result, newsprint and operating supply costs have been reduced. Included within technical and operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 are severance costs of $253 related to workforce reductions in the circulation and production areas as a result of ongoing cost containment initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 amounted to $110,660 (32% of revenues, net). For the period July 30, 2008 through December 31, 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $51,194 (28% of revenues, net).

For the period July 30, 2008 through December 31, 2008, restructuring expenses amounted to $7,225 (4% of revenues, net) comprised of $5,181 in severance and other related costs associated with the elimination of 106 staff positions, $572 related to lease and other contract exit costs, and $1,472 related to the write off of intangible assets due to the shutdown of one of the segments publishing businesses in December 2008. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $27,207 and represents the depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the Newsday transaction on July 29, 2008. Included within depreciation expense is $4,025 for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to depreciation expense associated with the decreased remaining useful lives of two presses that were phased out of service in mid year 2009.

Adjusted operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $21,775 (6% of revenues, net). This represents a decrease as a percent of revenues, net, over the adjusted operating cash flow for the period July 28, 2008 through December 31, 2008. This decrease is driven primarily by the continued economic downturn in 2009, which resulted in further advertising revenue declines, partially offset by expense savings, as discussed above.

Loss on interest rate swap contracts, net amounted to $205,683 and $76,568 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. The losses on interest rate swap contracts are a result of a shift in the yield curve over the life of the swap contracts.

As a result, our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the three months ended December 31, 2008 was $134.85 as compared with $125.10 for the three months ended December 31, 2007, a 7.8% increase. Our average monthly revenue per basic video subscriber for the three months ended September 30, 2008 was $133.11. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services. The following table presents certain subscriber information as of December 31, 2008, September 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007 for the Companys cable television systems (excluding Optimum Lightpath): As of December 31, 2008 As of September 30, 2008 As of December 31, 2007 (in thousands) Basic video customers 3,108 3,112 3,123 iO digital video customers 2,837 2,814 2,628 Optimum Online high speed data customers 2,455 2,427 2,282 Optimum voice customers 1,878 1,825 1,592 Total revenue generating units 10,278 10,178 9,625 For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company had a decline of 14,900 basic video customers compared to a decline of 3,700 in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company added 653,400 revenue generating units (RGUs), as compared to 797,500 in 2007. The decline in growth of RGUs of 144,100 is net of an increase in iO digital video customers of approximately 93,800 due to a digital migration initiative that eliminated the duplicate analog feeds of nine channels carried in digital. The growth in RGU additions slowed compared to 2007 as a result of the Companys relatively high penetration rates and, to a lesser extent, the effects of intensifying competition, particularly from Verizon. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) for 2008 increased $167,415 (8%) compared to 2007. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) due primarily to subscriber growth, expanded service offerings, programming rate increases and the cost to carry VOOM beginning July 1, 2007 $ 102,792 Increase in field service and network related costs primarily due to growth in revenue generating units and general cost increases 45,163 Increase in call completion and interconnection costs, taxes, and fees (net of related intra segment eliminations) primarily due to higher VoIP fees and higher voice customers, partially offset by lower rates 10,509 Increase in franchise fees 9,205 Other net decreases (348 ) Intra segment eliminations 94 $ 167,415 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 1% during 2008 as compared to 2007. 85 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $68,106 (7%) for 2008 as compared to 2007. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs $ 36,651 Increase in customer related costs (principally call center and billing related costs) primarily due to growth in revenue generating units and general cost increases 21,215 Increase in other general and administrative costs 15,668 Decrease in share based compensation expense and expenses related to Cablevisions long term incentive plans (5,393 ) Intra segment eliminations (35 ) $ 68,106 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained constant in 2008 as compared to 2007. Depreciation and amortization decreased $38,694 (4%) for 2008 as compared to 2007. The net decrease resulted primarily from lower depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated in 2007. Adjusted operating cash flow increased $207,477 for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to 2007.

In December 2008, the Company decided to discontinue the U.S. domestic programming of VOOM, and effective January 20, 2009, Cablevision ceased carriage of VOOM.

The increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs at AMC, WE tv and IFC due primarily to increased non film programming costs, programming related costs and broadband/video on demand related costs $ 18,644 Net increase resulting primarily from programming and content licensing costs of Sundance Channel from the date of acquisition and increased costs of RNC and News 12 Networks, partially offset by decreases at IFC Entertainment, Lifeskool and Sportskool 15,781 $ 34,425 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses decreased 2% during 2008 as compared to 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $42,263 (13%) for 2008 compared to 2007.

Amortization expense (including impairments) increased $30,223 for 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to amortization expense of $16,131 relating to amortizable identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of Sundance Channel and the write off of $15,034 of deferred carriage fees at VOOM HD after EchoStar ceased the distribution of VOOM in May 2008. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in depreciation expense of $5,770 as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to certain VOOM fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in 2007. Adjusted operating cash flow increased $58,400 in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in revenues, net of $136,585, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding share based compensation, restructuring and depreciation and amortization expenses of $78,185 due primarily to increased programming and selling, general and administrative costs all as further discussed above. 88 Table of Contents Madison Square Garden The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for the Madison Square Garden segment.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Cablevisions outstanding securities consist of Cablevision NY Group (CNYG) Class A common stock, CNYG Class B common stock and approximately $2,582,000 of debt securities, including $1,900,000 held by third party investors (including the senior notes issued in September 2009 discussed below) and approximately $682,000 (with a fair value of approximately $650,000 at the date of contribution on July 29, 2008), in connection with the Newsday transaction), which were contributed to CSC Holdings and are now held by Newsday Holdings LLC, its 97.2% owned subsidiary. The $682,000 of notes are eliminated in Cablevisions consolidated financial statements and are shown as notes due from Cablevision in the consolidated equity of CSC Holdings. On September 23, 2009, Cablevision issued $900,000 face amount of 8 5/8% senior notes due September 15, 2017. These notes are senior unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by any of Cablevisions subsidiaries. Cablevision may redeem all or a portion of the notes at any time at a price 96 Table of Contents equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium. Gross proceeds from the issuance were approximately $887,364 after giving effect to the original issue discount of approximately $12,636. In connection with the issuance of these debt securities, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $19,021. The net proceeds from the September offering, along with cash on hand, aggregating $869,600 were used by Cablevision to purchase 1,607,119 shares of common stock of CSC Holdings in October 2009, which in turn used the proceeds from the sale of its common stock to Cablevision, along with borrowings under its credit facility, to repurchase a portion of its outstanding senior notes pursuant to the September 2009 tender offers discussed below. Funding for the debt service requirements of our debt securities is provided by our subsidiaries operations, principally CSC Holdings, as permitted by the covenants governing CSC Holdings credit agreements and indentures. Funding for our subsidiaries is generally provided by cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under bank credit facilities made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined) and to Rainbow National Services LLC (RNS) and the proceeds from the issuance of securities in the capital markets. The decision of the Company as to the use of cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities of the Restricted Group and RNS will be based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under each respective credit agreement. Moreover, the Company will monitor the credit markets and may seek opportunities to issue debt, the proceeds of which could be used to meet its future cash funding requirements. The Company has accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past and may do so in the future. We have assessed the implications of the recent distress in the capital and credit markets on our ability to repay our scheduled debt maturities over the next twelve months and we currently believe that a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facilities should provide us with sufficient liquidity to repay such scheduled current debt maturities in the next twelve months totaling $310,000, as well as a $50,000 discretionary repayment (made in January 2010) under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2009. However, additional market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers inability to pay for the services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe that amounts available under our CSC Holdings and RNS revolving credit facilities will be available when, and if needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. The obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. In the longer term, we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we will be dependent upon our ability to access the capital markets. We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. 97 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our outstanding debt, including capital lease obligations, as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009: Restricted Group Rainbow National Services Newsday LLC(a) Other Entities Eliminations(b) Total CSC Holdings Cablevision Eliminations(c) Total Cablevision Bank debt $ 4,068,750 $ 580,000 $ 650,000 $ $ $ 5,298,750 $ $ $ 5,298,750 Capital lease obligations 15,894 1,328 51,729 (12,410 ) 56,541 56,541 Senior notes and debentures 3,134,909 299,283 3,434,192 2,548,642 (660,951 ) 5,321,883 Senior subordinated notes 323,817 323,817 323,817 Collateralized indebtedness relating to stock monetizations 375,832 375,832 375,832 Total debt $ 7,203,659 $ 1,218,994 $ 651,328 $ 427,561 $ (12,410 ) $ 9,489,132 $ 2,548,642 $ (660,951 ) $ 11,376,823 Interest expense $ 462,720 $ 75,842 $ 64,874 $ 35,929 $ $ 639,365 $ 176,525 $ (62,405 ) $ 753,485 Capital expenditures $ 686,626 $ 2,569 $ 7,514 $ 113,595 $ $ 810,304 $ $ $ 810,304 (a) CSC Holdings has guaranteed Newsdays obligation under its $650,000 senior secured credit facility.

Restricted Group As of December 31, 2009, CSC Holdings and those of its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television video operations (including approximately 3.1 million basic video customers, of which approximately 2.9 million subscribe to our digital video service), and high speed data service (approximately 2.6 million customers), and our VoIP services operations (approximately 2.1 million customers), as well as Optimum Lightpath, our commercial data and voice service business, comprise the Restricted Group as they are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and indentures governing the notes and debentures securities issued by CSC Holdings. In addition, the Restricted Group is also subject to the covenants of the debt issued by Cablevision. 99 Table of Contents Sources of cash for the Restricted Group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the Restricted Group, borrowings under its credit facility and issuance of securities in the capital markets and, from time to time, distributions or loans from its subsidiaries. The Restricted Groups principal uses of cash include: capital spending, in particular, the capital requirements associated with the growth of its services such as digital video, high speed data and voice (including enhancements to its service offerings such as a broadband wireless network (WiFi)); debt service, including distributions made to Cablevision to service interest expense on its debt securities; distributions to Cablevision to fund dividends payable to stockholders of CNYG Class A and CNYG Class B common stock; other corporate expenses and changes in working capital; and investments that it may fund from time to time. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group for the next 12 months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and available borrowings under the Restricted Groups credit facility. On May 27, 2009, CSC Holdings entered into an agreement that provided for an extension of the maturity date from March 29, 2013 to March 29, 2016 of $1,166,778 of the then $3,395,000 outstanding principal amount of the term B loan under its credit facility. Consenting lenders received a one time amendment fee of five basis points (.05%) on their total loan commitments. Lenders electing to extend their loan commitments will be paid an annual extension fee of 1.5% of their loan commitments through maturity on March 29, 2016. The Restricted Groups credit facility consists of four components: a $1,000,000 revolver, a $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility, a $2,228,222 term B loan facility and a $1,166,778 term B 2 extended loan facility. The four components of the Restricted Group credit facility are direct obligations of CSC Holdings, guaranteed by most Restricted Group subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of the stock of most Restricted Group subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2009, $50,000 was drawn and an additional $59,337 of the $1,000,000 revolving credit facility was restricted for certain letters of credit issued on behalf of CSC Holdings and $890,663 of the revolver was undrawn and was available to be drawn to meet the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group. The revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility mature in February 2012, the term B loan facility matures in March 2013 and the term B 2 extended loan facility matures in March 2016. The revolver has no required interim repayments. The $1,000,000 term A 1 loan facility requires quarterly repayments of $62,500 in 2010 and $100,000 in 2011. The $2,228,222 term B loan facility is subject to quarterly repayments of $5,743 through March 31, 2012 and $539,827 beginning on June 30, 2012 through its maturity date in March 2013. The $1,166,778 term B 2 extended loan facility is subject to quarterly repayments of $3,007 through December 30, 2015 and a final payment of $1,085,585 upon maturity in March 2016. The borrowings under the Restricted Group credit facility may be repaid without penalty at anytime. Outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, term A 1 loan facility, term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility were $50,000, $650,000, $2,210,994 and $1,157,756 respectively, at December 31, 2009. The weighted average interest rates as of December 31, 2009 on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, term A 1 loan facility, term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility were 1.23%, 1.26%, 2.00% and 2.00%, respectively. The principal financial covenants, which are not identical for the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, on the one hand, and the term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility, on the other, include (i) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, maximum total leverage (as defined in the term A 1 loan facility) that had been 5.00 times cash flow through December 31, 2009 with a step down on the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility to 4.50 times cash flow for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2010, (ii) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, maximum senior secured leverage (as defined in the term A 1 loan facility) that had been 3.25 times cash flow through December 31, 2009 with a step down on the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility to 3.00 times cash flow for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2010, (iii) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, a minimum ratio of cash flow to interest expense (as defined in the term A 1 loan facility) of 2.00 to 1, and (iv) under the revolving credit facility and the term A 1 loan facility, a minimum ratio of cash flow less cash taxes to 100 Table of Contents total debt expense (as defined in the term A 1 loan facility to include interest expense, certain payments of principal and dividends paid by CSC Holdings to Cablevision to permit Cablevision to pay interest and certain principal payments on its debt) of 1.50 to 1. These covenants and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds in the revolving credit facility may limit CSC Holdings ability to utilize all of the undrawn revolver funds. Additional covenants include limitations on liens and the issuance of additional debt. Under the term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility, CSC Holdings is limited in its ability to incur additional indebtedness based on a maximum total leverage ratio (as defined in the term B loan facility) that had been 5.50 times cash flow through December 31, 2009 with a subsequent step down to 5.00 times cash flow for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2010 and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio (as defined in the term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility) of 4.50 times cash flow. Under the revolving credit facility, the term A 1 facility, term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility, there are generally no restrictions on investments that the Restricted Group may make, provided it is not in default; however, CSC Holdings must also remain in compliance with the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow and the maximum senior secured leverage ratio (each as defined in the term A 1 loan facility). CSC Holdings ability to make restricted payments is also limited by provisions in the term B loan facility and term B 2 extended loan facility and the indentures covering CSC Holdings notes and debentures. The Restricted Group was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its various credit agreements as of December 31, 2009. On January 13, 2009, CSC Holdings issued $844,000 face amount of 8 1/2% senior notes due April 15, 2014.

Gross proceeds from the issuance were approximately $750,189, after giving effect to the original issue discount of approximately $93,811. In addition, we incurred financing costs of $16,434. The proceeds were used in connection with the February 2009 tender offers discussed below and to repay a portion of the remaining outstanding Cablevision floating rate senior notes due April 1, 2009 (April 2009 Notes). On February 12, 2009, CSC Holdings issued $526,000 face amount of 8 5/8% senior notes due February 15, 2019.

Gross proceeds from the issuance were approximately $500,731 after giving effect to the original issue discount of approximately $25,269. In addition, we incurred financing costs of $10,832. The proceeds were used in connection with the February 2009 tender offers discussed below and to repay a portion of the outstanding $500,000 face amount of Cablevision April 2009 Notes. On February 13, 2009, Cablevision announced that it commenced a cash tender offer (the Cablevision February Tender) for its outstanding April 2009 Notes for total consideration of $1,002.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes tendered for purchase, consisting of tender offer consideration of $997.50 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes plus an early tender premium of $5.00 per $1,000.00 principal amount of notes.

Cablevisions and CSC Holdings future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by their credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Key factors in the assessment of Cablevisions and CSC Holdings credit ratings include Cablevisions and CSC Holdings financial strength and flexibility, operating capabilities, management risk tolerance and ability to respond to changes in the competitive landscape. The corporate credit rating for Cablevision and CSC Holdings is Ba2 by Moodys with a stable outlook and BB by Standard & Poors with a negative outlook. Any future downgrade to the Cablevision and or CSC Holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact our ability to raise additional funds. In March 2008, the Company entered into several interest rate swap contracts that amended the terms of contracts (specifically maturity date and fixed rate paid by CSC Holdings) originally entered into in April 2006 with a notional amount of $3,700,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on a substantial portion of its floating rate debt. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. As a result of these transactions, the interest rate paid on approximately 90% of the Companys debt (excluding capital leases and collateralized indebtedness) is effectively fixed (57% being fixed rate obligations and 33% is effectively fixed through utilization of interest rate swap contracts) as of December 31, 2009. 102 Table of Contents The table below summarizes certain terms of these interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2009: Maturity Date Notional Amount Weighted Average Fixed Rate Paid by the Company Weighted Average Effective Floating Rate Received by the Company at December 31, 2009* March 2010 $ 1,100,000 3.65 % 0.26 % June 2012 $ 2,600,000 4.86 % 0.26 % * Represents the floating rate received by the Company under its interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2009 and does not represent the rates to be received by the Company on future payments. Rainbow and Rainbow National Services RNS, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, owns the Companys AMC, WE tv and IFC programming operations. Sources of cash for RNS include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in RNS and borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. RNS principal uses of cash include: the debt service of RNS and the net funding and investment requirements of other Rainbow programming entities including News 12 Networks, MSG Varsity and the continuing international operations of the VOOM HD Networks. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of RNS for the next 12 months including term loan repayments aggregating $25,000 will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and available borrowings under RNS bank credit facilities. RNS has an $800,000 senior secured credit facility (the RNS Credit Facility), which consists of a $500,000 term A loan facility and a $300,000 revolving credit facility. The term A loan facility matures June 30, 2013 and the revolving credit facility matures June 30, 2012. The RNS Credit Facility allows RNS to utilize up to $50,000 of the revolving credit facility for letters of credit and up to $5,000 for a swing loan. Further, the RNS Credit Facility provides for an incremental facility of up to $925,000, provided that it be for a minimum amount of $100,000. On June 3, 2008, RNS entered into an Incremental Revolver Supplement (Incremental Revolver) whereby RNS received commitments from lenders in the amount of $280,000. The interest rate under the Incremental Revolver is 2.0% over the Eurodollar rate for Eurodollar based borrowings and 1.0% over the Base Rate for Base Rate borrowings (as defined in the Incremental Revolver). The Incremental Revolver matures on June 30, 2012 and the terms and conditions of the Incremental Revolver are no more restrictive than those of the RNS Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Incremental Revolver may be repaid without penalty at any time. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Incremental Revolver facility at December 31, 2009. Outstanding borrowings under the term A loan facility and the original revolving credit facility were $450,000 and $130,000, respectively, at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average interest rate on both the term A loan facility and amounts drawn under the original revolving credit facility was 1.25%. As of December 31, 2009, $130,000 of the RNS revolving credit facility was drawn and RNS had $450,000 in total undrawn revolver commitments consisting of $170,000 under its original revolver and $280,000 under the Incremental Revolver, which undrawn amounts were available to be drawn to meet the net funding and investment requirements of RNS. Borrowings under the RNS Credit Facility are direct obligations of RNS which are guaranteed jointly and severally by substantially all of its subsidiaries and by Rainbow Programming Holdings LLC (RPH), the direct parent of RNS, and are secured by the pledge of the stock of RNS and substantially all of its subsidiaries, and all of the other assets of RNS and substantially all of its subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions). The term A loan requires quarterly repayments of $6,250 in 2010, $12,500 in 2011 and 2012, and $162,500 on March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the maturity of the term A loan. Any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity on June 30, 2012. 103 Table of Contents The RNS Credit Facility contains various financial and other covenants. As defined in the RNS Credit Facility, the financial covenants consist of (i) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to total interest expense for each quarter of 1.75 to 1, (ii) a maximum cash flow ratio of total indebtedness to operating cash flow of 6.25 to 1, and (iii) a maximum senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured debt to operating cash flow of 5.50 to 1. Additional covenants include restrictions on indebtedness, guarantees, liens, investments, dividends and distributions and transactions with affiliates. RNS was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2009. In addition, RNS is also subject to covenants of the senior and senior subordinated notes it has issued, which are generally less restrictive than those contained in the credit agreement. RNS future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings, which are provided by Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors. Key factors in the assessment of RNS credit ratings include its free cash flow generating capacity, fiscal strategy, enterprise value and industry risk. The corporate credit rating for RNS is Ba2 by Moodys with a stable outlook and BB by Standard & Poors with a negative outlook. Any future downgrade to the RNS credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact its ability to raise additional funds. In November 2008, RNS entered into interest rate swap contracts with a notional amount of $450,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on a substantial portion of its floating rate debt. These contracts were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. In November 2009, these contracts matured. Rainbow Media Holdings As of December 31, 2009, Madison Square Garden, L.P., a subsidiary of Madison Square Garden, which the Company distributed on February 9, 2010, had extended intercompany loans aggregating $190,000 to Rainbow Media Holdings, an unrestricted, indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cablevision. On January 28, 2010, the intercompany loans were replaced with a promissory note from Rainbow Media Holdings to Madison Square Garden, L.P. having a principal amount of $190,000. The note will accrue interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum. The note is non amortizing and has a maturity date of June 30, 2010 with prepayment without penalty at Rainbow Media Holdings option. We expect to be able to repay the promissory note through the use of one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and available borrowings under our credit facilities. Newsday LLC We currently expect that net funding and investment requirements for Newsday LLC for the next 12 months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities, interest income from the Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC, capital contributions and intercompany advances. Newsday has a $650,000 senior secured credit facility that is rated Ba3 with a stable outlook by Moodys and BB by Standard & Poors, and is comprised of two components: a $525,000 10.50% fixed rate term loan facility and a $125,000 floating rate term loan facility. The senior secured credit facility matures on August 1, 2013 and, subject to certain exceptions, requires mandatory prepayments out of the proceeds of certain sales of property or assets, insurance proceeds and debt and equity issuances. No mandatory prepayments are required prior to July 29, 2011, and the amount of prepayments thereafter are limited to $105,000 in the aggregate prior to July 29, 2012 and $140,000 in the aggregate prior to the maturity date. Optional prepayments are also permitted, subject to specified prepayment premiums. The interest rate on the floating rate term loan facility at December 31, 2009 was approximately 6.53%, representing the Eurodollar rate (as defined) plus 6.25%. 104 Table of Contents On October 28, 2009, Newsday LLC entered into an amendment to its credit facility that provided for: (a) the replacement of the 1.1 to 1 consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant with a $25,000 minimum liquidity covenant, (b) an increase in the interest rate applicable for the $525,000 fixed rate term loan facility from 9.75% to 10.50%, (c) an increase in the interest rate margin applicable to the $125,000 floating rate term loan facility from 5.50% to 6.25% and (d) increases in the prepayment premiums applicable to repayments of term loans prior to maturity. Newsday LLC paid each consenting lender a one time fee equal to 0.25% of the lenders commitment. The principal financial covenant for the senior secured credit facility is a minimum liquidity test of $25,000, which is tested bi annually on June 30 and December 31. The senior secured credit facility also contains other affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including limitations on indebtedness (other than permitted senior indebtedness (as defined) not exceeding $50,000 and permitted subordinated indebtedness (as defined) to be used for investments not to exceed $100,000), investments (other than investments out of excess cash flow and out of the proceeds of the Cablevision senior notes in excess of the outstanding borrowings and out of a $40,000 basket), and dividends and other restricted payments (other than in respect of management and guarantee fees and restricted payments out of excess cash flow and out of the proceeds of the Cablevision senior notes in excess of the outstanding borrowings). Certain of the covenants applicable to CSC Holdings under the Newsday LLC senior secured credit facility are similar to the covenants applicable to CSC Holdings under its outstanding senior notes. Newsday LLC was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2009. Borrowings by Newsday LLC under its senior secured credit facility are guaranteed by Newsday Holdings LLC, NMG Holdings, Inc. and CSC Holdings on a senior unsecured basis and secured by a lien on the assets of Newsday LLC, and the Cablevision senior notes receivable held by Newsday Holdings LLC. Monetization Contract Maturities Monetization contracts covering 10,738,809 shares of Comcast Corporation stock matured during 2009. We settled our obligations under the related Comcast collateralized indebtedness, net of the value of the related equity derivative contracts, by delivering cash from the net proceeds of monetization transactions covering an equivalent number of Comcast shares. The terms of the new contracts allow the Company to retain upside participation in Comcast shares up to each respective contracts upside appreciation limit with downside exposure limited to the respective hedge price. During the next twelve months, monetization contracts covering 8,069,934 shares of Comcast mature. The Company intends to either settle such transactions by delivering shares of the applicable stock and the related equity derivative contracts or by delivering cash from the net proceeds of new monetization transactions. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a discussion of our monetization contracts. 105 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Commitments The Companys contractual obligations to third parties as of December 31, 2009, which consist primarily of our debt obligations, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods, are summarized in the following table: Payments Due by Period Total Year 1 Years 2 3 Years 4 5 More than 5 years Other Off balance sheet arrangements: Programming obligations (1) $ 2,374,378 $ 946,312 $ 1,217,110 $ 199,471 $ 11,485 $ Purchase obligations (2) 1,697,215 406,588 299,428 181,836 809,363 Operating lease obligations (3) 986,811 113,658 231,722 214,609 426,822 Guarantees (4) 8,848 8,848 Letters of Credit (5) 61,738 3,815 57,923 5,128,990 1,479,221 1,806,183 595,916 1,247,670 Contractual obligations reflected on the balance sheet: Debt obligations (6) 11,439,995 531,401 4,377,097 2,707,886 3,823,611 Program rights obligations (7) 441,188 121,019 173,946 92,780 53,443 Capital lease obligations (8) 75,151 9,451 14,644 10,711 40,345 Taxes (9) 68,500 3,497 65,003 12,024,834 665,368 4,565,687 2,811,377 3,917,399 65,003 Total $ 17,153,824 $ 2,144,589 $ 6,371,870 $ 3,407,293 $ 5,165,069 $ 65,003 See discussion above regarding payment options the Company has on its monetization contracts.

EchoStar was issued a 20% interest in VOOM HD Holdings, the Companys subsidiary operating VOOM, and that 20% interest will not be diluted until $500,000 in cash has been invested in VOOM HD Holdings by the Company. On the fifth or eighth anniversary of the effective date of the investment agreement, the termination of the affiliation agreement by EchoStar, or other specified events, EchoStar has a put right to require a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings to purchase all of its equity interests in VOOM HD Holdings at fair value. On the seventh or tenth anniversary of the effective date of the investment agreement, or the second anniversary date of the termination of the affiliation agreement by EchoStar, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings has a call right to purchase all of EchoStars ownership in VOOM HD Holdings at fair value. The table above does not include any future payments that would be required upon the exercise of the put right, if any. See Item 3. Legal Proceeding EchoStar Contract Dispute. An indirect subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings owns a 90% interest in DTV Norwich LLC. The other investor has the right, for ten years, to put its remaining 10% interest to the Company at fair value to be determined by a process involving independent valuation experts. The table above does not include any future payments that would be required upon the exercise of this put right. At any time after the thirteenth anniversary of the closing of the Newsday Transaction and on or prior to the date that is six months after such anniversary, Tribune Company will have the right to require CSC Holdings to purchase Tribune Companys entire interest in Newsday Holdings LLC at the fair value of the interest at that time (see Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements). The table above does not include any future payments that would be required upon the exercise of this put right. Other Events On February 25, 2009, May 6, 2009, July 29, 2009 and November 2, 2009, the Board of Directors of Cablevision declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share paid on March 31, 2009, June 9, 2009, September 1, 2009, and December 4, 2009, respectively, to stockholders of record on both its CNYG Class A common stock and CNYG Class B common stock as of March 9, 2009, May 18, 2009, August 10, 2009, and November 13, 2009, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2009, CSC Holdings paid dividends to Cablevision aggregating approximately $790,082. The proceeds were used to fund: (i) Cablevisions rep urchase of a portion of Cablevisions April 2009 Notes pursuant to the tender offer completed in March 2009 ($196,269); (ii) Cablevisions repayment of the remaining outstanding balance of its April 2009 Notes upon their maturity ($303,731) (see Note 10); (iii) Cablevisions dividends paid on March 31, 2009, June 9, 2009, September 1, 2009 and December 4, 2009; (iv) Cablevisions interest payments on certain of its senior notes; and (v) Cablevisions payments for the acquisition of treasury shares related to statutory minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of certain restricted shares. On February 9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden, a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses previously owned and operated by the Companys Madison Square Garden segment. The MSG Distribution took the form of a distribution by Cablevision of one share of Madison Square Garden Class A Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group Class A Common Stock held of record on the Record Date and one share of Madison Square Garden Class B Common Stock for every four shares of Cablevision NY Group Class B Common Stock held of record on the Record Date. Through December 31, 2009, we have reflected the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden in our 107 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements within continuing operations. For the periods following the MSG Distribution, we will not consolidate the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of our own financial reporting. After the date of the MSG Distribution, the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden will be reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date beginning with the financial statements to be filed for the quarter ending March 31, 2010. Managing our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Interest Rate Risk To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. We diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. Interest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads. All interest rate swap contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Equity Price Risk We have entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of common stock of Comcast Corporation. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, in certain of the Comcast transactions, CSC Holdings provided guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statements of operations, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. 108 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010 06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. ASU No. 2010 06 outlines certain new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820 10. ASU No. 2010 06 amends ASC Topic 820 10 to now require that (a) a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers; and (b) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU No. 2010 06 clarifies existing disclosures on (a) how a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities, and (b) how a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. ASU No. 2010 06 is effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. These disclosures will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2011. Early adoption is permitted. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009 13, Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, which provides amendments that (a) update the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements, (b) establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, and (c) replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with the term selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions. ASU No. 2009 13 eliminates the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration to deliverables, requires the use of the relative selling price method and requires that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. ASU No. 2009 13 requires a vendor to significantly expand the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with the objective to provide information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. ASU No. 2009 13 is required to be adopted on a prospective basis to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All dollar amounts, except per subscriber, per unit and per share data, included in the following discussion under this Item 7A are presented in thousands. Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the shares of Comcast Corporation common stock held by us. We have entered into equity derivative contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying 109 Table of Contents stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2009, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. The carrying value of our collateralized indebtedness amounted to $375,832 at December 31, 2009. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast common stock, with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. As of December 31, 2009, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $362,113. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $36,211. As of December 31, 2009, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the equity derivative contracts entered into to partially hedge the equity price risk of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $35,970, a net receivable position. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a net gain on our outstanding equity derivative contracts of $631 and recorded unrealized losses of $430 on our holdings of Comcast common stock that we held during the period. Fair Value of Equity Derivative Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2008, net receivable position $ 113,737 Change in fair value, net 631 Settlement of contracts (78,398 ) Fair value as of December 31, 2009, net receivable position $ 35,970 The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via an equity derivative prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: # of Shares Hedge Price Cap Price (b) Security Deliverable Maturity per Share (a) Low High Comcast 8,069,934 2010 $20.03 $22.07 $ 30.04 $ 33.10 13,407,684 2011 $13.16 $17.45 $ 15.79 $ 22.68 (a) Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. (b) Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2009, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $6,985,546 was more than its carrying value of $6,546,529 by $439,017. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR based market rates and thus their carrying values approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2009 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $244,233 to $7,229,779. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund the approximately $3 billion special dividend paid in 2006, our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates and or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining 110 Table of Contents interest rate environment. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. We diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. Our interest rate swap contracts have been entered into by CSC Holdings and RNS. All such contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. In March 2008, the Company entered into several interest rate swap contracts that amended the terms of existing contracts (specifically maturity date and fixed rate paid by the Company) originally entered into in April 2006 in the notional amount of $3,700,000 to effectively fix borrowing rates on floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2009, these interest rate swap contracts had a fair value and carrying value of $211,462 a net liability position, as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2009 would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately $28,580 to a liability of $240,042. In November 2008, RNS entered into interest rate swap contracts with a notional amount of $450,000 which matured in November 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded a net loss on interest swap contracts of $78,864, as detailed in the table below: Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2008, a net liability position $ (265,937 ) Cash payments, net 133,339 Change in fair value, net (78,864 ) Fair value as of December 31, 2009, a net liability position $ (211,462 ) On March 24, 2009, the Companys remaining prepaid interest rate swap matured. We recorded a net loss on such interest swap contract of $4 in the first quarter of 2009.
