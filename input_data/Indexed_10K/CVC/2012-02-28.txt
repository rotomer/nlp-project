(40) Table of Contents CABLEVISION SYSTEMS CORPORATION All dollar amounts, except per subscriber, per unit, per share data, and tender prices per note, included in the following discussion under this Item 7, are presented in thousands. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Summary Our future performance is dependent, to a large extent, on general economic conditions including capital and credit market conditions, the impact of direct competition, our ability to manage our businesses effectively, and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace, both with suppliers and customers. Additional capital and credit market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers inability to pay for the services we provide. We have experienced some of the effects of this economic downturn. Continuation of events such as these may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. On February 9, 2010, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Madison Square Garden, a company which owns the sports, entertainment and media businesses previously owned and operated by the Companys Madison Square Garden segment. On June 30, 2011, Cablevision distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of AMC Networks Inc., a company which consists principally of national programming networks, including AMC, WE tv, IFC and Sundance Channel, previously owned and operated by the Companys Rainbow segment. As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution and the MSG Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of AMC Networks or Madison Square Garden for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden have been reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the AMC Networks Distribution date and the MSG Distribution date. Telecommunications Services Our Telecommunications Services segment, which accounted for 94% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011, derives revenues principally through monthly charges to subscribers of our video, high speed data and VoIP services and commercial data and voice services operations. These monthly charges include fees for cable television programming, high speed data and voice services, as well as equipment rental, DVR, video on demand, pay per view, installation and home shopping commissions. Revenue increases are derived from rate increases, increases in the number of subscribers to these services, including additional services sold to our existing subscribers, upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe, and acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers. We have not implemented a residential rate increase in 2012 and plan to extend the term of certain promotional offers, which will negatively impact revenue growth and our operating income. In addition, our ability to increase the number of subscribers to our services is significantly related to our penetration rates (the number of subscribers to our services as a percentage of serviceable passings, which represent the estimated number of single residence homes, apartment and condominium units and commercial establishments passed by the cable network in areas serviceable without further extending the transmission lines, including our commercial data and voice customers). As penetration rates increase, the number of available homes to which we can market our services generally decreases. We also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available on the programming carried on our cable television systems. Programming costs are the most significant part of our operating expenses and are expected to continue to increase primarily as a result of contractual rate increases and additional service offerings. Additionally, we currently anticipate an increase in our operating expenses as we make additional investments designed to enhance our products and services with a focus on retention and acquisition of subscribers. (41) Table of Contents In 2011, in our New York metropolitan service area, we began offering a free Optimum App for the iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone, which allows our cable television customers to experience iO TV digital service on their device in the home. While most programmers have not objected to the inclusion of their programming in the in home application, certain programmers have asserted that the application is a material breach of their affiliation agreements and a copyright violation yielding statutory damages. The Company has reached satisfactory resolutions of the issues with certain of these programmers. Other programmers continue to have concerns, but the Company believes it has a strong legal position. Our cable television service, which accounted for 54% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011, faces competition from video service provided by incumbent telephone companies, DBS service providers and others. As discussed in greater detail below, we face intense competition in our New York metropolitan service area from two incumbent telephone companies Verizon and AT&T, which offer video programming in addition to their voice and high speed Internet access services. To the extent the incumbent telephone companies, who have financial resources that exceed ours, continue to offer promotional packages at prices lower than ours, our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue may continue to be negatively impacted. There are two major providers of DBS service in the United States, DISH Network and DirecTV, each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have. We compete in our service areas with these DBS competitors by "bundling" our service offerings with products that the DBS companies cannot efficiently provide at this time, such as high speed data service, voice service and interactive services carried over the cable distribution plant. Historically, we have made substantial investments in the development of new and innovative programming options and other service offerings for our customers as a way of differentiating ourselves from our competitors. We currently anticipate a significant increase in our level of capital expenditures to enhance our product and service offerings. Verizon and AT&T offer video programming as well as voice and high speed Internet access services to residential customers in our New York metropolitan service area. Verizon has constructed fiber to the home network plant that passes a significant number of households in our New York metropolitan service area (while difficult to assess, our estimates indicate that Verizon passes more than 45% of these households, based on currently available information). Verizon has obtained authority to provide video service for a majority of these homes passed, on a statewide basis in New Jersey, in numerous local franchises in New York State, including all of New York City, and in a small portion of Connecticut. AT&T offers video service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area. This competition impacts our video revenue in these areas and may continue to do so in the future. Our high speed data services business, which accounted for 20% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011, faces intense competition from other providers of high speed Internet access, including Verizon and AT&T in our New York metropolitan service area and CenturyLink in our Optimum West service area. Due to our high penetration in our New York metropolitan service area (54.9% of serviceable passings at December 31, 2011) and the impact of intense competition, our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future may continue to be negatively impacted. Our VoIP offering, which accounted for 13% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011, faces intense competition from other providers of voice services, including carriers such as Verizon and AT&T in the New York metropolitan service area and CenturyLink in our Optimum West service area. We compete primarily on the basis of pricing, where unlimited United States and Canada (including Puerto Rico in the New York metropolitan service area and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Optimum West service area) long distance, regional and local calling, together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra, are offered at one low price. Due to our high penetration in the New York metropolitan service area (44.7% of serviceable passings at December 31, 2011) and the impact of intense competition, our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future may continue to be negatively impacted. (42) Table of Contents The Telecommunications Services segment advertising and other revenues accounted for 2% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011. Optimum Lightpath, which operates in our New York metropolitan service area accounted for 4% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011. Optimum Lightpath operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies incumbent local exchange carriers such as Verizon and AT&T, other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies. To the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices, future success of our Optimum Lightpath business may be negatively impacted. The trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless data medium. This trend could also negatively impact the future growth of Optimum Lightpath if it were to accelerate. Other Our Other segment, which accounted for 6% of our consolidated revenues, net of inter segment eliminations, for the year ended December 31, 2011, includes the operations of (i) Newsday, which includes the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com, (ii) our motion picture theatre business, Clearview Cinemas, (iii) the News 12 Networks, our regional news programming services, (iv) the MSG Varsity network, our network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities, (v) our cable television advertising company, Cablevision Media Sales Corporation ("Cablevision Media Sales"), previously known as Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation, and (vi) certain other businesses and unallocated corporate costs. Newsday Newsdays revenue is derived primarily from the sale of advertising and the sale of newspapers ("circulation revenue"). For the year ended December 31, 2011, advertising revenues accounted for 71% and circulation revenues accounted for approximately 28% of the total revenues of Newsday. Newsdays circulation revenue is derived primarily from home delivery subscriptions of the Newsday newspaper, and single copy sales of Newsday through local retail outlets. Local economic conditions affect the levels of retail and classified newspaper advertising revenue. General economic conditions, changes in consumer spending, auto sales, housing sales, unemployment rates, job creation, readership and circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising. For the year ended December 31, 2011, Newsday experienced a decline of $20,750 (9%) in advertising revenues as compared to 2010. Circulation revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $958 (1%) over the same period in the prior year due primarily to the impact of home delivery price increases. Newsday and the newspaper industry generally have experienced significant declines in advertising and circulation revenue as circulation and readership levels continue to be adversely affected by competition from new media news formats and less reliance on newspapers by some consumers, particularly younger consumers, as a source of news and classifieds. A prolonged decline in circulation levels would also have a material adverse effect on the rate and volume of advertising revenues. Newsdays largest categories of operating expenses relate to the production and distribution of its print products. These costs are driven by volume (number of newspapers printed and number of pages printed) and the number of pages printed are impacted by the volume of advertising and editorial pages. The majority of Newsdays other costs, such as editorial content creation, rent and general and administrative expenses do not directly fluctuate with changes in advertising and circulation revenue. (43) Table of Contents Clearview Cinemas Clearview Cinemas derives revenues primarily from box office ticket sales, concession stand sales, and, to a lesser extent, from advertising shown at the start of each performance and from venue rentals. Our ability to attract customers to our theatres is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to obtain high quality film content at competitive pricing. News 12 Networks Our News 12 Networks, which include seven 24 hour local news channels and five traffic and weather services dedicated to covering areas within the New York metropolitan area, derives its revenues from the sale of advertising on its networks and affiliation fees paid by cable operators, principally Cablevision. MSG Varsity MSG Varsity is a network dedicated entirely to showcasing high school sports and activities. It does not receive intercompany affiliation fees from the Telecommunications Services segment and has minimal revenues. Cablevision Media Sales Cablevision Media Sales, previously Rainbow Advertising Sales Corporation, is a cable television advertising company that derives its revenues from the sale of local and regional commercial advertising time on cable television networks in the New York metropolitan area, which offers advertisers the opportunity to target geographic and demographic audiences. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, include the following: Impairment of Long Lived and Indefinite Lived Assets: The Companys long lived and indefinite lived assets at December 31, 2011 include goodwill of $442,773, other intangible assets of $1,548,994 ($1,296,123 of which are indefinite lived intangible assets), and $3,269,232 of property, plant and equipment. Such assets accounted for approximately 74% of the Companys consolidated total assets. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets, which represent primarily the Companys cable television franchises, various trademarks and licenses, are tested annually for impairment during the first quarter ("annual impairment test date") and upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances. The Company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill utilizing an enterprise value based premise approach. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. For the purpose of evaluating goodwill impairment at the annual impairment test date, the Company had three reporting units containing approximately 98% of the Companys goodwill balance of $442,067. These reporting units are the Consumer Services (cable television) reporting unit in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment ($401,320), the Optimum Lightpath reporting unit in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment ($21,487), and the Clearview Cinemas reporting unit in the Other reportable segment ($10,348). (44) Table of Contents The impairment test for identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The following table sets forth the amount of identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets reported in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2011: Reportable Segment Unit of Accounting Identifiable Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Balance Telecommunications Services Cable Television Franchises $ 1,240,228 Other Newsday Trademarks 45,300 Telecommunications Services and Other FCC licenses and other indefinite lived intangibles 10,595 $ 1,296,123 For other long lived assets, including intangible assets that are amortized, the Company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indication of potential impairment. If the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets, the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value. In assessing the recoverability of the Companys goodwill and other long lived assets, the Company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgments and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows, discount rate, determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables. For the reporting units in the Telecommunications Services reportable segment, these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer, number of serviceable passings, operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of serviceable passings, among other assumptions. Further, the projected cash flow assumptions consider contractual relationships, customer attrition, eventual development of new technologies and market competition. For Newsday, these valuations also include assumptions for advertising and circulation revenue trends, operating margin, market participant synergies, and market multiples for comparable companies. If these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets. Based on the Companys annual impairment test during the first quarter of 2011, the Companys reporting units had significant safety margins, representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit less its respective carrying value (including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit). In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value calculations of the Companys reporting units on the annual impairment calculation for goodwill, the Company applied hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases to the estimated fair values of each reporting unit. These hypothetical decreases of 10%, 20% and 30% would have no impact on the goodwill impairment analysis for any of the Companys reporting units with the exception of the Clearview Cinemas reporting unit. For Clearview Cinemas, which had a goodwill carrying value of $10,348 at December 31, 2011, a 22% reduction in its estimated fair value would result in a step one failure. A step one failure would require the Company to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and, if required, the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss. (45) Table of Contents The Companys primary identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets that represent over 95% of the identifiable indefinite lived intangibles are the Companys cable television franchises and various reporting unit trademarks, which are valued using an income approach or market approach. The Companys cable television franchises are the largest of the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets and reflect agreements we have with state and local governments that allow us to construct and operate a cable business within a specified geographic area. Our cable television franchises are valued using a discounted cash flows ("DCF") methodology. The DCF methodology used to value cable television franchises entails identifying the projected discrete cash flows related to such cable television franchises and discounting them back to the valuation date. The projected discrete cash flows related to such cable television franchises represent the rights to solicit and the right to service potential customers in the service areas defined by franchise rights currently held by the Company. Significant judgments inherent in a valuation include the selection of appropriate discount rates, estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows attributable to the cable television franchises and identification of appropriate continuing growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the DCF analysis are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. Based on the Companys annual impairment test during the first quarter of 2011, the Companys units of accounting that represent approximately 56% of the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets have significant safety margins, representing the excess of the identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets estimated fair value unit of accounting over their respective carrying values. Bresnans identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets had no safety margins as they were acquired at fair value in December 2010. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of all the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangibles, the Company applied hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases to the estimated fair value of each of the Companys identifiable indefinite lived intangibles. These hypothetical 10%, 20% and 30% decreases in estimated fair value would have resulted in an impairment to the Companys Bresnan related franchise rights, and the Newsday related trademarks, which had a carrying value of $565,000 (approximately $508,000 related to Bresnan) at the annual impairment test date. The hypothetical fair value decreases would have resulted in impairment charges of approximately $56,000 at 10%, approximately $112,000 at 20%, and approximately $168,000 at 30% related to these identifiable indefinite lived intangibles. During the fourth quarter of 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $11,000, $7,800 and $2,000, respectively, relating to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of Newsdays indefinite lived intangible trademarks. The Company determined the fair value of our Newsday reporting unit based on a weighting of the estimated fair values determined under the income approach and the market approach. The income approach utilizes a DCF valuation methodology, which requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the projected future cash flows including the cash flows generated from potential synergies a market participant may generate, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, including expected cash flows beyond the Companys current long term business planning period, and certain tax benefits the Company would recognize. The discount rate utilized for the interim impairment assessment was a consolidated weighted average discount rate of 12.5% at December 31, 2011 and 12% at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The market approach measures fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable publicly traded newspaper publishing companies and comparable transactions taking into consideration potential synergies a market participant may generate and requires significant judgments in determining comparable market multiples. The weighting between the income approach and market approach was weighted more towards the income approach based on our belief that the income approach was more reliable in the midst of the steep economic decline impacting the publishing industry, and in view of the fact that there were no recent observable sales transactions involving the newspaper business. The estimated fair values of Newsdays indefinite lived intangibles, which relate primarily to the trademarks associated with its newspaper mastheads, were based on discounted future cash flows calculated based on the relief from royalty method. Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. (46) Table of Contents The reduction in estimated fair values of the trademarks under the relief from royalty method was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate for the Newsday print newspaper from 11.5% in 2009 to 12.0% in 2010 and 12.5% in 2011, and a decline in the Companys revenue projections for the Newsday print newspaper and newsday.com in comparison to the revenue projections originally used when Newsday was acquired in July 2008. The primary reason for the increase in the discount rate for the Newsday print newspaper trademark from 11.5% in 2009 to 12.5% in 2011 was due to an increase in both the estimated cost of equity and debt for the industry, which was primarily due to an increase in the economic volatility affecting the overall economy, and in particular the newspaper publishing industry, and an increase in borrowing costs to the industry. The assumed royalty rate remained at 3% for 2009, 2010 and 2011, although this was a decline from the 4% that was originally used when Newsday was acquired. The decrease from 4% to 3% was due to the lower projected margins for the Newsday print newspaper and newsday.com. Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets: Deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the Companys future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards ("NOLs"). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income and tax planning strategies to allow for the utilization of its NOLs and deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets, resulting in additional income tax expense in the Companys consolidated statement of income. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly. At this time, based on current facts and circumstances, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets, except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded which relate to certain state NOLs. The Company increased the valuation allowance by $1,822 in 2011, decreased the valuation allowance by $2,428 in 2010 and decreased the valuation allowance by $1,427 in 2009. In connection with the AMC Networks Distribution, a reduction in the valuation allowance of $491 was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, certain state NOLs expired prior to utilization. The deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired NOLs had been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $425, $287 and $3,609 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. To address state income tax planning considerations, certain subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies during 2009. Certain state NOLs, for which the related deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance, were eliminated pursuant to such conversions. Accordingly, the associated deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by $9,355 in 2009. (47) Table of Contents Plant and Equipment: Costs incurred in the construction of the Companys cable television system, including line extensions to, and upgrade of, the Companys hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and headend facilities are capitalized. These costs consist of materials, subcontractor labor, direct consulting fees, and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities. The internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of Company employees and the portion of facility costs, including rent, taxes, insurance and utilities, that supports the construction activities. These costs are depreciated over the estimated life of the plant (10 to 25 years) and headend facilities (4 to 25 years). Costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities, including repairs and maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to connect businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the infrastructure or digital platform are also capitalized. These costs include materials, subcontractor labor, internal labor to connect, provision and provide on site and remote technical assistance and other related costs associated with the connection activities. In addition, on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized. The departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics, and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity. New connections are amortized over the estimated useful lives of 5 years or 12 years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home, respectively. The portion of departmental costs related to reconnection, programming service up and down grade, repair and maintenance, and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant and such lives are revised to the extent necessary due to changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives are reflected prospectively. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to the policies discussed above and other items. Legal Contingencies The Company is party to various lawsuits and proceedings and is subject to other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some involving claims for substantial damages. The Company records an estimated liability for these claims when management believes the loss from such matters is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company reassesses the risk of loss as new information becomes available and adjusts liabilities as necessary. The actual cost of resolving a claim may be substantially different from the amount of the liability recorded. Refer to Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a discussion of our legal contingencies. Certain Transactions The following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: (48) Table of Contents 2011 Transactions On June 30, 2011, Cablevision completed the AMC Networks Distribution. As a result of the AMC Networks Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of AMC Networks for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AMC Networks have been reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the AMC Networks Distribution date. 2010 Transactions On February 9, 2010, Cablevision completed the MSG Distribution. As a result of the MSG Distribution, the Company no longer consolidates the financial results of Madison Square Garden for the purpose of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of Madison Square Garden have been reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the MSG Distribution date. On December 14, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of Bresnan Cable for a purchase price of $1,364,276. The acquisition was financed using an equity contribution by CSC Holdings of $395,000, which CSC Holdings borrowed under its revolving loan facility, and debt consisting of an undrawn $75,000 revolving loan facility, a $765,000 term loan facility and $250,000 8.0% senior notes due 2018. Non GAAP Financial Measures We define adjusted operating cash flow (AOCF), which is a non GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization (including impairments), excluding share based compensation expense or benefit and restructuring charges or credits. Because it is based upon operating income (loss), AOCF also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non operating income and expense items. We believe that the exclusion of share based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the various operating units of our business without regard to the distortive effects of fluctuating stock prices in the case of stock appreciation rights and, in the case of restricted shares, restricted stock units and stock options, the expense associated with an award that is not expected to be made in cash. We present AOCF as a measure of our ability to service our debt and make continuing investments, including in our capital infrastructure. We believe AOCF is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our business segments and the company on a consolidated basis. AOCF and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors, analysts and peers to compare performance in our industry. Internally, we use net revenues and AOCF measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate managements effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. AOCF should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Since AOCF is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. Each presentation of AOCF in this Annual Report on Form 10 K includes a reconciliation of AOCF to operating income (loss).

and Other, consisting principally of (i) Newsday, which includes the Newsday daily newspaper, amNew York, Star Community Publishing Group, and online websites including newsday.com and exploreLI.com; (ii) our motion picture theatre business, Clearview Cinemas, (iii) the News 12 Networks, (iv) the MSG Varsity network, (v) Cablevision Media Sales, a cable television advertising company, and (vi) certain other businesses and unallocated corporate costs. We allocate certain amounts of our corporate overhead to each segment based upon their proportionate estimated usage of services, except for Newsday as to which we allocated the incremental costs incurred in providing these services through September 30, 2009. Subsequent to September 30, 2009, we allocated certain amounts of our corporate overhead to Newsday based upon its proportionate estimated usage of such services. Corporate overhead costs previously allocated to AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden that were not eliminated as a result of the AMC Networks Distribution in June 2011 and the MSG Distribution in February 2010 have been reclassified to continuing operations. Subsequent to July 1, 2011 and January 1, 2010, amounts allocated to AMC Networks and Madison Square Garden, respectively, represent charges pursuant to transition services agreements. The segment financial information set forth below, including the discussion related to individual line items, does not reflect inter segment eliminations unless specifically indicated. See "Business Segments Results" for a discussion relating to the operating results of our segments. In those sections, we provide detailed analysis of the reasons for increases or decreases in the various line items at the segment level. Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $523,273 (8%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 544,131 Decrease in revenues of the Other segment (22,077 ) Inter segment eliminations 1,219 $ 523,273 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) include primarily: cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis; network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections; interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers; and publication production and distribution costs of our Newsday business. (52) Table of Contents Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) in 2011 increased $304,792 (11%) as compared to 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 314,287 Decrease in expenses of the Other segment (9,558 ) Inter segment eliminations 63 $ 304,792 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses increased 1% in 2011 as compared to 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $41,613 (3%) for 2011 as compared to 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 64,319 Decrease in expenses of the Other segment (23,862 ) Inter segment eliminations 1,156 $ 41,613 As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2011 as compared to 2010. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) increased $127,882 (14%) for 2011 as compared to 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 118,618 Increase in expenses of the Other segment 9,264 $ 127,882 Adjusted operating cash flow increased $171,115 (8%) for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in AOCF of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 164,275 Increase in AOCF of the Other segment 6,840 $ 171,115 Interest expense, net increased $34,955 (5%) for 2011 as compared to 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Net increase due to change in average debt balances $ 36,391 Increase due to higher average interest rates on our indebtedness 9,887 Higher interest income (339 ) Other net decrease (term loan extension fees of $11,034 were included in 2010) (10,984 ) $ 34,955 See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" discussion below for a detail of our borrower groups. Gain on sale of affiliate interests of $683 and $2,051 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, relate to the installment sale of our ownership interest in PVI Virtual Media Services LLC ("PVI"). Gain on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $37,384 and $109,813, respectively, consists primarily of the increase in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains are partially offset by the losses on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below. (53) Table of Contents Gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 of $1,454 and $(72,044), respectively, consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses due to the change in fair value of the Companys equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains and losses are partially offset by the losses or gains on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above. Loss on interest rate swap contracts, net amounted to $7,973 and $85,013 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. The losses on interest rate swap contracts are a result of a shift in the yield curve over the life of the swap contracts. Loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs amounted to $92,692 and $110,049 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 amount represents amounts paid in excess of the aggregate principal amount to repurchase CSC Holdings senior notes due April 2012, April 2014 and June 2015 and related fees associated with the tender offers and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts related to such repurchases. The 2010 amount represents premiums paid to repurchase a portion of Cablevision senior notes due April 2012 and related fees associated with the tender offer and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to such repurchases. Income tax expense of $184,436 for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflected an effective tax rate of 44%. The Company recorded a tax benefit of $1,015 due to the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes. An increase in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards resulted in tax expense of $1,822. The Company recorded tax expense of $1,699, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions. In addition, the exclusion of the pretax loss of an entity that is not consolidated for income tax purposes resulted in additional tax expense of $2,509. The Company recorded income tax expense of $113,767 for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting an effective tax rate of 35%. In the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit of $18,951 for an increase in certain state and city net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to the finalization of an examination with a state taxing authority. Absent this tax benefit, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been 41%. The Company recorded tax expense of $5,842 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes principally due to the impact of the MSG Distribution on February 9, 2010. A decrease in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards resulted in a tax benefit of $2,428. The Company recorded tax expense of $1,202, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company has fully offset federal taxable income with a net operating loss carry forward. However, the Company is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and certain state and local income taxes that are payable quarterly. (54) Table of Contents Income (loss) from discontinued operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 reflects the following items: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Net operating results of AMC Networks, including transaction costs, net of income taxes(a) $ 53,623 $ 157,970 Net operating results of Madison Square Garden, including transaction costs, net of income taxes(b) (4,122 ) $ 53,623 $ 153,848 (a) Includes operating results of AMC Networks through the date of the AMC Networks Distribution. (b) Includes operating results of the Madison Square Garden segment from January 1, 2010 through the date of the MSG Distribution. Business Segments Results Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for our Telecommunications Services segment: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Favorable (Unfavorable) Revenues, net $ 6,279,653 100 % $ 5,735,522 100 % $ 544,131 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) 2,648,743 42 2,334,456 41 (314,287 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,167,632 19 1,103,313 19 (64,319 ) Depreciation and amortization 942,647 15 824,029 14 (118,618 ) Operating income $ 1,520,631 24 % $ 1,473,724 26 % $ 46,907 The following is a reconciliation of operating income to AOCF: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Favorable Amount Amount (Unfavorable) Operating income $ 1,520,631 $ 1,473,724 $ 46,907 Share based compensation 32,635 33,885 (1,250 ) Depreciation and amortization 942,647 824,029 118,618 AOCF $ 2,495,913 $ 2,331,638 $ 164,275 (55) Table of Contents Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $544,131 (9%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Years Ended December 31, Increase Percent Increase Increase due to Bresnan Percent Increase (Decrease), Net of Bresnan Cable 2011 2010 (Decrease) (Decrease) Cable Impact Video (including equipment rental, DVR, video on demand, and pay per view) $ 3,521,882 $ 3,237,793 $ 284,089 9 % $ 248,629 1 % High speed data 1,329,354 1,193,624 135,730 11 119,493 1 Voice 885,343 808,374 76,969 10 62,868 2 Advertising 150,671 135,890 14,781 11 11,578 2 Other (including installation, advertising sales commissions, home shopping, and other products) 100,953 94,907 6,046 6 6,952 (1 ) Total Cable Television 5,988,203 5,470,588 517,615 9 449,520 1 Optimum Lightpath 310,976 284,034 26,942 9 9 Intra segment eliminations (19,526 ) (19,100 ) (426 ) (2 ) (2 ) Total Telecommunications Services $ 6,279,653 $ 5,735,522 $ 544,131 9 % $ 449,520 2 % Revenue increases reflected above are primarily due to the acquisition of our Bresnan Cable system on December 14, 2010. Revenue increases are also primarily derived from higher rates (primarily due to an increase in video rates of 2.9% on average for our New York metropolitan service area subscribers, which was implemented beginning in December 2010), increases in the number of subscribers to our high speed data and voice services as set forth in the table below, additional services sold to our existing video subscribers, and other revenue increases. These increases are partially offset by a decline in video customers primarily in our New York metropolitan service area, promotional offer pricing discounts and other rate changes, and declines in other revenue. Our average monthly revenue per video subscriber for our New York metropolitan service area for the three months ended December 31, 2011 was $156.09 as compared to $153.97 and $150.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The increase in advertising revenue is primarily due to the acquisition of our Bresnan Cable system as well as a general improvement in the cable television advertising market in 2011. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services. (56) Table of Contents The following table presents certain statistical information as of December 31, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010 for our cable television systems in the New York metropolitan service area (excluding Optimum Lightpath) and the Optimum West service area: December 31, 2011 September 30, 2011 December 31, 2010 New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West(a) Total New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West(a) Total New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West(a) Total (in thousands) Total customers 3,255 (b) 356 3,611 (b) 3,269 (b) 353 3,622 (b) 3,298 (b) 350 3,648 (b) Video customers 2,947 303 3,250 2,962 302 3,264 3,008 306 3,314 High speed data customers 2,701 264 2,965 2,688 257 2,945 2,653 239 2,892 Voice customers 2,201 156 2,357 2,178 148 2,326 2,138 131 2,269 (a) Reflects data related to Bresnan Cable, which was acquired by the Company on December 14, 2010. (b) Reflects approximately 3 additional customers as a result of a revision in our statistical reporting in March 2011. The Company had a loss of 60,300 basic video customers in the New York metropolitan service area for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a loss of 55,500 in 2010. We believe our video subscriber losses are largely attributable to the continuing economic downturn and intense competition, particularly from Verizon. The length of the economic downturn and this intense competition could continue to impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for 2011 increased $314,287 (13%) as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of Bresnan Cables technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization), such expenses increased $98,478 (4%) in 2011 as compared to 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) primarily due to programming costs for the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations of $114,946, rate increases and new program offerings, partially offset by lower subscribers to certain tiers of video service $ 167,197 Adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to estimated programming costs recorded in years prior to 2011 resulting from the renewals of contracts that expired in previous years (42,900 ) Nonrecurring settlement of a contractual fee matter related to years prior to 2009 recorded in the second quarter 2010 23,000 Increase in field operations and network related costs primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $74,632 and general cost increases primarily related to maintenance and insurance in the New York metropolitan service area 107,082 Increase in voice related and other general costs, primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $30,296. The increase in the New York metropolitan service area is primarily due to an increase in voice related fees, termination and interconnection costs 44,541 Increase in employee overtime and repair costs attributable to two severe storms in the New York metropolitan service area 16,300 Nonrecurring contract termination charge related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system recorded in the fourth quarter 2010 (14,375 ) Increase in franchise fees primarily due to fees for the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations of $10,310, increase in revenues subject to franchise fees and higher rates in certain regions 13,400 Intra segment eliminations 42 $ 314,287 Technical and operating expenses consist primarily of programming costs and direct costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers. These costs typically rise due to general inflationary cost increases for employees, contractors, programming rates, insurance and other various expenses. Certain of these costs are also variable based on the number of customers. Costs of field operations also increase as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize decreases due to lower new customer installations and lower new service upgrades. Network related costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes. Franchise fees are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are primarily based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue, primarily video revenue, which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. We expect that our technical and operating expenses will continue to increase in the future. (57) Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $64,319 (6%) for 2011 as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of Bresnan Cables selling, general and administrative expenses, such expenses decreased $17,641 (2%) in 2011 as compared to 2010. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired reversals and Bresnan Cable system of $35,670, and in the New York metropolitan service area higher employee and consumer incentive related costs, partially offset by lower costs related to program carriage disputes recorded in the first quarter 2010 $ 49,234 Decrease in expenses relating to long term incentive plan awards to employees primarily due to accrual reversals and reductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $25,353 (see discussion below) (30,558 ) Increase in customer related costs, primarily due to costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $29,007, increased high speed data and voice customers and general cost increases, partially offset by a decrease in customer related costs in the New York metropolitan service area primarily due to a reduction in call center labor costs due to fewer calls handled 19,217 Increase primarily in call center overtime costs attributable to two severe storms in the New York metropolitan service area 3,800 Other net increases primarily due to administrative costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $17,282, and the impact of insurance, legal, other fees and employee costs (including $3,236 of certain executive separation costs in the fourth quarter of 2011) in the New York metropolitan service area 22,587 Intra segment eliminations 39 $ 64,319 Selling, general and administrative expenses include customer related costs, principally from the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities. These costs generally rise as the number of customers grow and also as a result of general inflationary cost increases for employees and other various expenses. Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of employee costs and advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs may vary period to period and may increase with intense competition. The payment of long term cash incentive awards is based on achievement of performance targets set at the time of the award. As a result of our current strategy to make additional investments designed to enhance our products and services with a focus on retention and acquisition of customers, these targets are not expected to be achieved for awards due to be paid in 2013 and expected to be only partially achieved for awards due to be paid in 2014. Accordingly, in 2011, the related accruals were reversed or substantially reduced. Prior to the AMC Networks Distribution, the Telecommunications Services segment received a management fee calculated based on gross revenues of AMC and WE tv (as defined under the terms of the management agreement) on a monthly basis. Historically, these management fees were reported as a contra expense and amounted to $13,958 for the year ended December 31, 2011 (which represents management fees through June 30, 2011) as compared to $26,511 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The management agreement was terminated in connection with the AMC Networks Distribution and the fees received have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. (58) Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization increased $118,618 (14%) for 2011 as compared to 2010. The net increase resulted primarily from depreciation and amortization related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $156,510 and depreciation of new asset purchases, offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Adjusted operating cash flow increased $164,275 (7%) for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to adjusted operating cash flow related to the operations of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system of $145,632, and an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in both technical and operating and selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and share based compensation, as discussed above. Other The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for the Other segment. Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Favorable (Unfavorable) Revenues, net $ 443,898 100 % $ 465,975 100 % $ (22,077 ) Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) 336,760 76 346,318 74 9,558 Selling, general and administrative expenses 320,452 72 344,314 74 23,862 Restructuring expense (credits) 6,311 1 (58 ) (6,369 ) Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 72,327 16 63,063 14 (9,264 ) Operating loss $ (291,952 ) (66 )% $ (287,662 ) (62 )% $ (4,290 ) The following is a reconciliation of operating loss to AOCF deficit: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Favorable Amount Amount (Unfavorable) Operating loss $ (291,952 ) $ (287,662 ) $ (4,290 ) Share based compensation 11,901 16,404 (4,503 ) Restructuring expense (credits) 6,311 (58 ) 6,369 Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) 72,327 63,063 9,264 AOCF deficit $ (201,413 ) $ (208,253 ) $ 6,840 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $22,077 (5%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in revenues at Newsday (from $314,148 to $293,148) due primarily to decreases in advertising revenues as a result of the continued challenging economic environment and competition from other media $ (21,000 ) Increase in advertising revenues at News 12 Networks and commission revenues at Cablevision Media Sales 3,442 Decrease in other revenues primarily at PVI and Clearview Cinemas (3,045 ) Intra segment eliminations (1,474 ) $ (22,077 ) Newsdays total average circulation for the six months ended September 25, 2011 was approximately 405,000 on weekdays, approximately 390,000 on Saturdays and approximately 477,000 on Sundays. These circulation figures include for the first time digital subscriptions (most of which are free to Optimum Online and certain Newsday print subscribers) to Newsdays restricted access website as these were not previously reported. These circulation figures include Newsdays total average print circulation of approximately 292,000 on weekdays, approximately 278,000 on Saturdays and approximately 357,000 on Sundays, which represents a decline of approximately 6.9%, 5.5%, and 4.6%, respectively, over the comparable prior year period. (59) Table of Contents Newsdays other publications, which include amNew York and Star Community Publishing, are distributed for free. amNew York averaged weekday circulation of approximately 317,000 for the six months ended September 25, 2011, a decrease of approximately 10% over the comparable prior year period. Star Community Publishing distributed approximately 1,851,000 copies each week (for the six months ended September 25, 2011), a decrease of approximately 1% over the comparable prior year period. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $9,558 (3%) as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in operating costs of PVI $ (5,486 ) Decrease in expenses at Newsday (from $187,606 to $183,508) primarily due to a decrease in production and distribution expenses, partially offset by an increase in newsprint and ink expenses (4,098 ) Other net increases 26 $ (9,558 ) Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $23,862 (7%) as compared to the prior year. The net decreases are attributable to the following: Decrease in unallocated Corporate costs due primarily to an increase in allocations to business units and a decrease in transaction costs related to the Bresnan acquisition of $8,879, which was consummated in December 2010 $ (16,057 ) Increase in unallocated Corporate costs primarily due to employee related costs (including $10,698 of certain executive separation costs in the fourth quarter of 2011) and an increase in legal and other professional fees 12,599 Decrease in expenses relating to long term incentive plan awards to employees primarily due to accrual reversals and reductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $7,592, excluding Newsday, (see discussion below) (11,721 ) Decrease at Newsday (from $110,403 to $105,040) including a decrease of $3,494 in expenses relating to long term incentive plan awards to employees primarily due to accrual reversals and reductions in the fourth quarter of 2011 of $2,629 (5,363 ) Other net decreases (1,846 ) Intra segment eliminations (1,474 ) $ (23,862 ) For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we allocated certain corporate overhead, including share based compensation expense and expenses related to Cablevisions long term incentive plans of $18,834 (through June 30, 2011, the AMC Networks Distribution date), and $38,015, respectively, to AMC Networks. Such expenses were not eliminated as a result of the AMC Networks Distribution and have been reclassified to the Other segment for all periods presented. The payment of long term cash incentive awards is based on achievement of performance targets set at the time of the award. As a result of our current strategy to make additional investments designed to enhance our products and services with a focus on retention and acquisition of customers, these targets are not expected to be achieved for awards due to be paid in 2013 and expected to be only partially achieved for awards due to be paid in 2014. Accordingly, in 2011, the related accruals were reversed or substantially reduced. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $9,264 (15%) as compared to the prior year. The net increase is primarily due to depreciation of new asset purchases and an increase in impairment charges recorded at Newsday ($12,724 in 2011 and $7,800 in 2010), partially offset by decreases in depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. (60) Table of Contents Adjusted operating cash flow deficit decreased $6,840 (3%) for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 2010 (including Newsdays AOCF of $7,237 in 2011 compared to AOCF of $19,349 in 2010). The increase for the twelve month period was due primarily to decreases in revenues, net, partially offset by decreases in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share based compensation, as discussed above. Comparison of Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2010 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2009 Consolidated Results Cablevision Systems Corporation Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $277,501 (5%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in revenues of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 304,022 Decrease in revenues of the Other segment (28,291 ) Inter segment eliminations 1,770 $ 277,501 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) include primarily: cable programming costs which are costs paid to programmers, net of amortization of any launch support received, for cable content and are generally paid on a per subscriber basis; network management and field service costs which represent costs associated with the maintenance of our broadband network, including costs of certain customer connections; interconnection, call completion and circuit fees relating to our telephone and VoIP businesses which represent the transport and termination of calls with other telecommunications carriers; and publication production and distribution costs of our Newsday business. Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation, amortization and impairments) in 2010 increased $130,904 (5%) as compared to 2009. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 134,460 Decrease in expenses of the Other segment (3,688 ) Inter segment eliminations 132 $ 130,904 As a percentage of revenues, technical and operating expenses remained constant 2010 as compared to 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses include primarily sales, marketing and advertising expenses, administrative costs, and costs of customer call centers. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51,206 (4%) for 2010 as compared to 2009. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 45,256 Increase in expenses of the Other segment 4,312 Inter segment eliminations 1,638 $ 51,206 (61) Table of Contents As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% in 2010 compared to 2009. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) decreased $29,316 (3%) for 2010 as compared to 2009. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in expenses of the Telecommunications Services segment $ (32,890 ) Increase in expenses of the Other segment 3,574 $ (29,316 ) Adjusted operating cash flow increased $95,860 (5%) for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in AOCF of the Telecommunications Services segment $ 127,443 Decrease in AOCF of the Other segment (31,583 ) $ 95,860 Interest expense, net increased $40,937 (6%) for 2010 as compared to 2009. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase due to higher average interest rates on our indebtedness, including extension fees to lenders $ 36,639 Net decrease due to change in average debt balances (6,693 ) Lower interest income 2,836 Other net increases (including an increase in arrangement fees for term loan extensions) 8,155 $ 40,937 See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" discussion below for a detail of our various borrower groups. Gain on sale of affiliate interests, amounted to $2,051 for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily from the sale of our ownership interest in PVI. Gain (loss) on investments, net for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $109,813 and $(977), respectively, consists primarily of the increase or decrease in the fair value of Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these gains and losses are partially offset by the losses and gains on the related equity derivative contracts, net described below. Gain (loss) on equity derivative contracts, net for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $(72,044) and $631, respectively, consists of unrealized and realized losses and gains due to the change in fair value of the Companys equity derivative contracts relating to the Comcast common stock owned by the Company. The effects of these losses and gains are partially offset by the gains or losses on investment securities pledged as collateral, which are included in gain (loss) on investments, net discussed above. Loss on interest rate swap contracts, net amounted to $85,013 and $75,631 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These interest rate swap contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. The losses on interest rate swap contracts are a result of a shift in the yield curve over the life of the swap contracts. Loss on extinguishment of debt and write off of deferred financing costs amounted to $110,049 and $73,457 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 2010 amount represents premiums paid to repurchase a portion of Cablevision senior notes due April 2012 and related fees associated with the tender offer and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to such repurchases. The 2009 amount represents the premiums paid to repurchase a portion of Cablevision senior notes due April 2009, CSC Holdings senior notes due July 2009, and senior debentures due August 2009 and related fees associated with the tender offers. They also included the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to such repurchases. (62) Table of Contents Income tax expense of $113,767 for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting an effective tax rate of 35%. In the second quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a nonrecurring tax benefit of $18,951 for an increase in certain state and city net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to the finalization of an examination with a state taxing authority. Absent this tax benefit, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been 41%. The Company recorded tax expense of $5,842 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes principally due to the impact of the MSG Distribution on February 9, 2010. A decrease in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards resulted in a tax benefit of $2,428. The Company recorded tax expense of $1,202, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense of $113,177 for the year ended December 31, 2009, reflected an effective tax rate of 48%. To address state income tax planning considerations, during 2009 certain subsidiary corporations were converted to limited liability companies. In connection with such conversions, the Company recorded tax expense of $9,095 relating to the elimination of certain state NOLs and credit carry forwards. Absent this tax expense, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have been 44%. The Company recorded tax benefit of $6,764 for the impact of a change in the state rate used to measure deferred taxes. A decrease in the valuation allowance relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards resulted in a tax benefit of $1,427. The Company recorded tax benefit of $105, including accrued interest, related to uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has fully offset federal taxable income with a net operating loss carry forward. However, the Company is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and certain state and local income taxes that are payable quarterly. Income (loss) from discontinued operations Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 reflects the following items: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Net operating results of Madison Square Garden, including transaction costs, net of income taxes(a) $ (4,122 ) $ 35,856 Net operating results of AMC Networks, including transaction costs, net of income taxes 157,970 125,611 $ 153,848 $ 161,467 (a) Includes operating results of the Madison Square Garden segment from January 1, 2010 through February 9, 2010, the date of the MSG Distribution. (63) Table of Contents Business Segments Results Telecommunications Services The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, certain historical financial information and the percentage that those items bear to revenues, net for our Telecommunications Services segment: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Amount % of Net Revenues Amount % of Net Revenues Favorable (Unfavorable) Revenues, net $ 5,735,522 100 % $ 5,431,500 100 % $ 304,022 Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) 2,334,456 41 2,199,996 41 (134,460 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,103,313 19 1,058,057 19 (45,256 ) Depreciation and amortization 824,029 14 856,919 16 32,890 Operating income $ 1,473,724 26 % $ 1,316,528 24 % $ 157,196 The following is a reconciliation of operating income to AOCF: Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Favorable Amount Amount (Unfavorable) Operating income $ 1,473,724 $ 1,316,528 $ 157,196 Share based compensation 33,885 30,748 3,137 Depreciation and amortization 824,029 856,919 (32,890 ) AOCF $ 2,331,638 $ 2,204,195 $ 127,443 Revenues, net for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $304,022 (6%) as compared to revenues, net for the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Years Ended December 31, Percent 2010 2009 Increase Increase Video (including analog, digital, pay per view, video on demand and digital video recorder) $ 3,237,793 $ 3,080,078 $ 157,715 5 % High speed data 1,193,624 1,146,789 46,835 4 Voice 808,374 771,236 37,138 5 Advertising 135,890 105,633 30,257 29 Other (including installation, home shopping, advertising sales commissions, and other products) 94,907 94,066 841 1 Total Cable Television 5,470,588 5,197,802 272,786 5 Optimum Lightpath 284,034 255,549 28,485 11 Intra segment eliminations (19,100 ) (21,851 ) 2,751 13 Total Telecommunications Services $ 5,735,522 $ 5,431,500 $ 304,022 6 % Revenue increases reflected above are primarily derived from higher rates (primarily due to an increase in video rates of 3.7% on average, which was implemented beginning in December 2009), increases in the number of subscribers to our high speed data and voice services as set forth in the table below, including additional services sold to our existing video subscribers, upgrades by video customers from the level of the programming package to which they subscribe, and acquisition transactions that result in the addition of new subscribers. The acquisition of our Bresnan Cable system on December 14, 2010, resulted in an approximate $22,100 increase in revenues, net. These increases are partially offset by promotional offer pricing discounts and a decline in video customers in our New York metropolitan service area and other rate changes. Our average monthly revenue per video subscriber for the three months ended December 31, 2010 was $150.68 (for our New York metropolitan service area only) as compared to $149.04 and $144.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. (64) Table of Contents We believe the increase in advertising revenue is primarily due to a general improvement in the cable television advertising market and political advertising in 2010. The increase in Optimum Lightpath net revenues is primarily attributable to growth in Ethernet data services, partially offset by reduced traditional data services and lower intra segment revenue. The following table presents certain statistical information as for our cable television systems in the New York metropolitan service area (excluding Optimum Lightpath) and the Optimum West service area as of December 31, 2010: December 31, 2010 New York Metropolitan Service Area Optimum West(a) Total September 30, 2010 December 31, 2009 (in thousands) Total customers 3,298 (a) 350 3,648 (a) 3,321 3,314 Video customers 3,008 306 3,314 3,043 3,063 High speed data customers 2,653 239 2,892 2,647 2,568 Voice customers 2,138 131 2,269 2,129 2,052 (a) Reflects data related to Bresnan Cable, which was acquired by the Company on December 14, 2010. Total RGUs as of December 31, 2010, include 880,900 RGUs related to the acquisition of our Bresnan Cable system in December 2010. Excluding the impact of the Bresnan Cable system, the Company had a loss of 55,500 video customers for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a loss of 45,100 in 2009. This is largely attributable to the impact of a retransmission consent dispute in October 2010, the economic downturn, and, to a lesser extent, intense competition, particularly from Verizon. For the year ended December 31, 2010, excluding the impact of the Bresnan Cable system, the Company added 128,600 RGUs as compared to 297,700 in 2009. These additions include increases in digital video customers of approximately 40,500 and 50,600 for the years ended 2010 and 2009, respectively, resulting from the migration from analog to full digital across certain regions of our service area. The length of the economic downturn, along with intense competition, could impact our ability to maintain or increase our existing customers and revenue in the future. (65) Table of Contents Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for 2010 increased $134,460 (6%) as compared to 2009. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in programming costs (including costs of on demand services) due primarily to rate increases (see discussion of MSG networks below), new program offerings and programming costs for the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations ($5,662), partially offset by lower subscribers to certain tiers of service $ 88,206 Nonrecurring settlement of a contractual fee matter related to years prior to 2009 recorded in the second quarter of 2010 (23,000 ) Increase in field operations and network related costs primarily due to lower capitalizable activities, general cost increases, costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system ($5,003), and growth in RGUs 31,417 Nonrecurring contract termination charge related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system 14,375 Increase in franchise fees due to increase in video revenues and higher rates in certain regions 8,239 Impact of accrual reversals in 2009 due to legislative changes which clarified the applicability of certain VoIP fees 18,976 Lower termination rates, partially offset by higher interconnection costs due to the favorable resolution of certain disputed costs in 2009 (termination and interconnection costs are net of related intra segment eliminations) (3,532 ) Intra segment eliminations (221 ) $ 134,460 Technical and operating expenses consist primarily of programming costs and direct costs associated with providing and maintaining services to our customers. These costs typically rise as the number of RGUs grow and also due to general inflationary cost increases for employees, contractors, programming rates and other various expenses. Costs of field operations also increase as the portion of our expenses that we are able to capitalize decreases due to lower new customer installations and lower new service upgrades. Network related costs also fluctuate as capitalizable network upgrade and enhancement activity changes. Franchise fees are payable to the state governments and local municipalities where we operate and are based on a percentage of certain categories of revenue, primarily video revenue which vary by state and municipality. These costs change in relation to changes in such categories of revenues or rate changes. We expect that our technical and operating expenses will continue to increase in the future. However, as a percentage of revenues, we expect these costs to remain relatively constant. Effective January 1, 2010, a new long term affiliation agreement was entered into between Cablevision and the MSG networks, which are owned by Madison Square Garden. This new long term affiliation agreement resulted in incremental programming costs to the Company of approximately $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the amount of programming costs recognized by the Company pursuant to the Companys arrangement with Madison Square Garden in 2009. This new affiliation agreement provides for the carriage of the MSG Network and MSG Plus program services on the Companys cable television systems in the tri state area. This agreement has a term of 10 years, obligates the Company to carry the MSG networks program services on its cable television systems and provides for the payment by the Company to the MSG networks of a per subscriber license fee, which fee is increased each year during the term of the agreement. (66) Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $45,256 (4%) for 2010 as compared to 2009. The net increase is attributable to the following: Increase in sales and marketing costs primarily due to increased customer promotions, higher commissions, higher advertising costs, including costs related to program carriage disputes, and costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system ($2,003) $ 22,283 Impact of the favorable resolution of litigation, that resulted in a reversal of expense recognized in prior periods, recorded in 2009 5,579 Decrease in customer related costs in the New York metropolitan service area primarily due to a reduction in call center labor costs due to fewer calls handled, partially offset by increased RGUs and general cost increases (3,937 ) Increase in share based compensation expense and expenses relating to Cablevisions long term incentive plans 8,087 Other net increases primarily due to legal costs, other fees and employee costs in the New York metropolitan service area and administrative costs associated with the operation of the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system ($2,244) 13,471 Intra segment eliminations (227 ) $ 45,256 Selling, general and administrative expenses include customer related costs, principally from the operation and maintenance of our call center facilities that handle customer inquiries and billing and collection activities. These costs generally rise as the number of RGUs grow and also as a result of general inflationary cost increases for employees and other various expenses. Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of employee costs and advertising production and placement costs associated with acquiring and retaining customers. These costs may increase with intense competition. Prior to the AMC Networks Distribution, the Telecommunications Services segment received a management fee calculated based on gross revenues of AMC and WE tv (as defined under the terms of the management agreement) on a monthly basis. Historically, these management fees were reported as a contra expense and amounted to $26,511 and $23,773, for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The management agreement was terminated in connection with the AMC Networks Distribution and the fees received have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. Depreciation and amortization decreased $32,890 (4%) for 2010 as compared to 2009. The net decrease resulted primarily from certain assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by depreciation of new asset purchases and depreciation and amortization of $6,791 related to the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system. Adjusted operating cash flow increased $127,443 (6%) for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was due to an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share based compensation, as discussed above. The year ended 2010 increase includes the $23,000 nonrecurring settlement of a contractual fee matter related to years prior to 2009 recorded in 2010, partially offset by a $14,375 nonrecurring contract termination charge related to the Bresnan Cable system. The increase in 2010 was also negatively impacted by the reversal of an accrual in 2009 due to legislative changes which clarified the applicability of certain VoIP fees of $18,976 and the impact of the favorable resolution of litigation that resulted in a reversal of expense recognized in prior periods recorded in 2009 of $5,579.

The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in revenues at Newsday (to $314,148) due primarily to decreases in advertising revenues as a result of the continued challenging economic environment and competition from other media $ (28,188 ) Increase in advertising revenues at News 12 Networks and commission revenues at Cablevision Media Sales 10,128 Decrease in other revenues primarily at PVI and Clearview Cinemas (8,986 ) Intra segment eliminations (1,245 ) $ (28,291 ) Technical and operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization shown below) for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $3,688 (1%) as compared to the prior year. The net decrease is attributable to the following: Decrease in expenses at Newsday (to $187,606) primarily due to a decrease in newsprint and ink expenses, a decrease in distribution expense driven primarily by declines in circulation and preprint advertising sales volume, and a decrease in production expenses driven primarily by the cost savings related to headcount reductions and the exiting of certain shopper publications, as well as the impact of lower union compensation costs $ (22,982 ) Increase in operating costs of the MSG Varsity network resulting from its September 2009 launch 18,516 Other net increases 778 $ (3,688 ) (68) Table of Contents Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $4,312 for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior year. The net increase is attributable to the following: Decrease in unallocated Corporate costs due primarily to a net increase in allocations to business units of $10,664 and lower costs related to former employees of $11,168 $ (21,832 ) Charges to Madison Square Garden in 2010 for transition services (6,096 ) Increase in costs at MSG Varsity, Cablevision Media Sales and News 12 Networks 19,591 Transaction costs related to the Bresnan Cable acquisition 8,924 Other net increases 4,970 Intra segment eliminations (1,245 ) $ 4,312 For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we allocated certain corporate overhead, including share based compensation expense and expenses related to Cablevisions long term incentive plans, of $38,015 and $34,275, respectively, to AMC Networks. Such expenses will not be eliminated as a result of the AMC Networks Distribution and have been reclassified to the Other segment for all periods presented. Depreciation and amortization (including impairments) for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $3,574 (6%) as compared to the prior year. The net increase is primarily due to an impairment charge recorded at Newsday of $7,800 in 2010 relating to the estimated fair value of Newsdays indefinite lived intangible trademark, as compared to $2,000 in the prior year, and depreciation of new asset purchases, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and a decrease in depreciation expense of $4,025 related to two Newsday printing presses that were phased out of service in mid year 2009. Restructuring expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 amounted to $5,583. This is comprised of $3,590 in severance and other related costs associated with the elimination of 98 staff positions and $3,174 related to a lease modification termination penalty and other lease and contract exit costs at Newsday. Offsetting these expenses are restructuring credits of $1,181 related to adjustments in severance and facility realignment provisions recorded in prior restructuring plans. Adjusted operating cash flow deficit increased $31,583 (18%) for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 2009 (including AOCF of Newsday of $19,349 and $21,775 in 2010 and 2009, respectively). The increase was due primarily to a decrease in revenues, net, partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and share based compensation, as discussed above.

(74) Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cablevision Cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries. Cablevisions outstanding securities consist of CNYG Class A common stock, CNYG Class B common stock and approximately $2,931,000 of debt securities, including approximately $2,177,000 face value of debt securities held by third party investors and approximately $754,000 held by Newsday Holdings LLC. The $754,000 of notes are eliminated in Cablevisions consolidated financial statements and are shown as notes due from Cablevision in the consolidated equity of CSC Holdings. Funding for the Companys Debt Service Requirements Funding for the debt service requirements of our debt securities is provided by our subsidiaries operations, principally CSC Holdings, as permitted by the covenants governing CSC Holdings credit agreements and indentures. Funding for our subsidiaries is generally provided by cash flow from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under credit facilities made available to the Restricted Group (as later defined) and Bresnan Cable, and the proceeds from the issuance of securities in the capital markets. Our decision as to the use of cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities of the Restricted Group and Bresnan Cable will be based upon an ongoing review of the funding needs of the business, the optimal allocation of cash resources, the timing of cash flow generation and the cost of borrowing under each respective credit agreement. Moreover, we will monitor the credit markets and may seek opportunities to issue debt, the proceeds of which could be used to meet our future cash funding requirements. The Company has accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital in the past and may do so in the future. We have assessed the implications of the volatility in the capital and credit markets on our ability to repay our scheduled debt maturities over the next 12 months and we currently believe that a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operating activities and availability under our revolving credit facilities should provide us with sufficient liquidity to repay such scheduled current debt maturities in the next 12 months totaling approximately $208,681 under our credit facilities, senior notes and notes payable as of December 31, 2011. However, additional market disruptions could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to lower demand for our products, such as cable television services, as well as lower levels of television and newspaper advertising, and increased incidence of customers inability to pay for the services we provide. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Although we currently believe that amounts available under our CSC Holdings and Bresnan Cable revolving credit facilities will be available when, and if needed, we can provide no assurance that access to such funds will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. The obligations of the financial institutions under our revolving credit facilities are several and not joint and, as a result, a funding default by one or more institutions does not need to be made up by the others. In the longer term, we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated capital expenditures, meet all existing future contractual payment obligations and repay our debt at maturity. As a result, we will be dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets. We will need to raise significant amounts of funding over the next several years to fund capital expenditures, repay existing obligations and meet other obligations, and the failure to do so successfully could adversely affect our business. If we are unable to do so, we will need to take other actions including deferring capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking strategic investments from third parties or reducing or eliminating dividend payments and stock repurchases or other discretionary uses of cash.

(77) Table of Contents Restricted Group As of December 31, 2011, CSC Holdings and those of its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television video operations and high speed data service, and our VoIP services operations in the New York metropolitan service area, as well as Optimum Lightpath, our commercial data and voice service business, comprise the "Restricted Group" as they are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and indentures governing the notes and debentures issued by CSC Holdings. In addition, the Restricted Group is also subject to the covenants of the debt issued by Cablevision. Sources of cash for the Restricted Group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the Restricted Group, borrowings under its credit facility and issuance of securities in the capital markets and, from time to time, distributions or loans from its subsidiaries. The Restricted Groups principal uses of cash include: capital spending, in particular, the capital requirements associated with the growth of its services such as digital video, high speed data and voice (including enhancements to its service offerings such as a broadband wireless network (WiFi)); debt service, including distributions made to Cablevision to service interest expense on its debt securities; distributions to Cablevision to fund dividends paid to stockholders of CNYG Class A and CNYG Class B common stock; distributions to Cablevision to fund share repurchases; other corporate expenses and changes in working capital; and investments that it may fund from time to time. We currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the Restricted Group for the next 12 months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and available borrowings under the Restricted Groups credit facility. Amendment and Restatement of Credit Facility Credit Agreement On April 13, 2010, CSC Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries, the "Restricted Subsidiaries", entered into an amended credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), providing for (i) an amendment and restatement of the credit agreement, dated as of February 24, 2006, as first amended and restated in its entirety as of May 27, 2009 and further amended and restated in its entirety as of April 13, 2010, and (ii) an amendment to the incremental term supplement, dated as of March 29, 2006 and amended as of May 27, 2009. Among other things, the Credit Agreement provides for the specific mechanics of extending, from time to time, the revolving credit commitments, term A loans, incremental term loans and any additional facility commitments or additional facility loans, as applicable, with the terms of such extended facility to be documented at the time of such extension in an extended facility agreement. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, CSC Holdings entered into three extended facilities as of April 13, 2010, as follows: an extended revolving loan facility agreement (the "Extended Revolving Loan Facility") that provided for the extension of the availability period for lenders holding approximately $820,000 of revolving credit commitments under CSC Holdings $1,000,000 Revolving Credit Facility to March 31, 2015. Lenders under the Extended Revolving Loan Facility are entitled to an extension fee payment of between 2.00% and 2.50% per annum of the outstanding loans under the Extended Revolving Loan Facility, based upon the cash flow ratio applicable from time to time. In addition, revolving credit lenders with revolving credit commitments in the aggregate amount of $412,000 executed joinders to the Credit Agreement agreeing to provide increased revolving credit commitments with an availability period expiring on March 31, 2015. (78) Table of Contents an extended term A facility agreement (the "Term A 3 extended loan facility") that provided for the extension of the maturity date for lenders holding approximately $480,000 of loans under CSC Holdings existing $650,000 Term A loan facility, at the time of the launch of the transaction, to March 31, 2015. Lenders under the Term A 3 extended loan facility are entitled to an extension fee payment of between 2.00% and 2.50% per annum of the outstanding loans under the Term A 3 extended facility, based upon the cash flow ratio applicable from time to time. an extended incremental term facility agreement (the "Term B 3 extended loan facility") that provided for the extension of the maturity date for lenders holding approximately $1,678,000 under CSC Holdings existing $2,200,000 incremental term facility, at the time of the launch of the transaction, to March 29, 2016.

On June 30, 2010, the availability period for $20,000 of revolving credit commitments under CSC Holdings Revolving Loan Facility was extended to March 31, 2015 and the maturity date of $4,786 of loans under CSC Holdings existing term A facility was extended to March 31, 2015. In April 2010, the Company utilized $200,000 of its increased revolver commitments to make a $200,000 pre payment of the unextended term B credit facility. In addition, in December 2010, the Company utilized $395,000 of its revolver commitments to make a $395,000 equity contribution in Bresnan Cable. On November 14, 2011, CSC Holdings entered into an extended term A facility Agreement (the "Term A 4 extended loan facility") pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Term A 4 extended loan facility agreement increases the commitments of certain existing term A lenders and includes commitments of certain new term A lenders, with the effect being to create the Term A 4 extended loan facility, providing for $600,000 of extended term A loans with a final maturity date of December 31, 2016. Lenders under the Term A 4 extended loan facility are entitled to an extension fee payment of between 1.50% and 2.50% per annum of the outstanding extended facility loans under the Term A 4 extended loan facility, based upon the Cash Flow Ratio applicable from time to time; provided that until June 2012 the extension fee shall remain at 2.00% per annum. In connection with the Term A 4 extended loan facility, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of $4,490, which are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility. A portion of the proceeds from the Term A 4 extended loan facility was used to repay the outstanding balances of the Term A 1 loan facility and Term B loan facility. In connection with the repayments, the Company recorded a write off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Term A 1 loan facility and Term B loan facility of approximately $470. Loans under the Restricted Group credit facility are direct obligations of CSC Holdings, guaranteed by most Restricted Group subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of the stock of most Restricted Group subsidiaries. Credit Facility Repayments The revolver has no required interim repayments. The Term A 3 extended loan facility is subject to quarterly repayments of approximately $12,142 through March 2012, approximately $18,213 beginning in June 2012 through March 2013, approximately $24,284 beginning in June 2013 through March 2014 and approximately $54,640 beginning in June 2014 through its maturity date in March 2015.

The Company exchanged the AMC Networks senior notes and senior secured term loans in satisfaction and discharge of $1,250,000 outstanding indebtedness under its Restricted Group revolving loan and extended revolving loan facilities. Financial Covenants for the Restricted Group Credit Facility The principal financial covenants for the Restricted Group credit facility are summarized below: Maximum Maximum Ratio of Minimum Minimum Ratio of Total Senior Secured Ratio of Cash Ratio of Cash Indebtedness to Indebtedness to Flow to Interest Flow Less Cash Cash Flow(a) Cash Flow(a) Expense(a) Taxes to Total Debt(a) Revolving loan facility 4.5 3.0 2.0 to 1 1.5 to 1 Extended revolving loan facility 4.5 3.0 2.0 to 1 1.5 to 1 Term A 3 extended loan facility 4.5 3.0 2.0 to 1 1.5 to 1 Term A 4 extended loan facility 4.5 3.0 2.0 to 1 1.5 to 1 Term B 2 extended loan facility(b) 5.0 4.5 n/a n/a Term B 3 extended loan facility(b) 5.0 4.5 n/a n/a (a) As defined in each respective loan facility.

These covenants and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds in the revolving loan facility may limit CSC Holdings ability to utilize all of the undrawn revolver funds. Additional covenants include limitations on liens and the issuance of additional debt. Under the Restricted Group credit facility there are generally no restrictions on investments that the Restricted Group may make, provided it is not in default; however, CSC Holdings must also remain in compliance with the maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow and the maximum ratio of senior secured indebtedness to cash flow (each as defined in the term A 1 loan facility). CSC Holdings ability to make restricted payments is also limited by provisions in the Term B loan facility, Term B 2 extended loan facility, Term B 3 extended loan facility, and the indentures covering CSC Holdings notes and debentures. The Restricted Group was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under the Restricted Group credit facility as of December 31, 2011.

The total amount validly tendered represented approximately 76% of the outstanding principal amount of the June 2015 Notes, approximately 23% of the outstanding principal amount of the CSC Holdings April 2012 Notes, and approximately 31% of the outstanding principal amount of the April 2014 Notes. Tender premiums aggregating $65,433, along with other transaction costs of approximately $957, have been recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts related to the portion of the June 2015 Notes, April 2014 Notes and CSC Holdings April 2012 Notes repurchased aggregating approximately $21,302 were written off in 2011.

Interest Rate Swaps As of December 31, 2011, CSC Holdings was party to several interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2,600,000 that effectively fixed borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. As a result of the CSC Holdings interest rate swap transactions, the interest rate paid on approximately 81% of the Companys outstanding debt (excluding capital leases and collateralized indebtedness) is effectively fixed (56% being fixed rate obligations and 25% is effectively fixed through utilization of these interest rate swap contracts) as of December 31, 2011. The table below summarizes certain terms of these interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2011: Maturity Date Notional Amount Weighted Average Fixed Rate Paid by the Company Weighted Average Effective Floating Rate Received by the Company at December 31, 2011* June 2012 $2,600,000 4.86% 0.54% * Represents the weighted average effective floating rate received by the Company under its interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2011 and does not represent the rates to be received by the Company on future payments. Bresnan Cable Credit Facility Debt We currently expect that net funding and investment requirements for Bresnan Cable for the next 12 months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under its credit facility. Bresnan Cable has an $840,000 senior secured credit facility which is comprised of two components: a $765,000 term loan facility and a $75,000 revolving loan facility (collectively, the "Bresnan Credit Agreement"). In connection with the financing of the Bresnan acquisition in December 2010, the full $765,000 amount of the term loan facility was drawn, net of an original issue discount of approximately $7,700. The revolving loan facility, which includes a $25,000 sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $5,000 sublimit for swingline loans, was not drawn in connection with the transaction. Such revolving loan facility is expected to be available to provide for ongoing working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Bresnan Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which at the option of Bresnan Cable may be either 2.0% over a floating base rate or 3.0% over an adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.50%. The Bresnan Credit Agreement requires Bresnan Cable to pay a commitment fee of 0.75% in respect of the average daily unused commitments under the revolving loan facility. Bresnan Cable is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees, as well as fronting fees, to banks that issue letters of credit pursuant to the Bresnan Credit Agreement. (82) Table of Contents All obligations under the Bresnan Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Holdings Sub (the direct parent of Bresnan Cable) and each of Bresnan Cables existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the Bresnan Credit Agreement (the "Guarantors"). All obligations under the Bresnan Credit Agreement, including the guarantees of those obligations, will be secured by certain assets of the Bresnan Cable and the Guarantors, including a pledge of the equity interests of Bresnan Cable. Bresnan Cable may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans under the Bresnan Credit Agreement at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (except for customary breakage costs with respect to Eurodollar loans, if applicable). If Bresnan Cable makes a prepayment of term loans in connection with certain refinancing transactions, Bresnan Cable must pay a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the amount of term loans prepaid. With certain exceptions, Bresnan Cable is required to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances, including (i) a specified percentage of excess cash flow beginning in 2012 depending on its cash flow ratio, (ii) from the net cash proceeds of certain sales of assets (subject to reinvestment rights), (iii) from casualty insurance and or condemnation proceeds, and (iv) upon the incurrence of certain indebtedness. The term loan facility requires remaining quarterly repayments of $1,913 from 2012 through September 2017, and $713,363 on December 14, 2017, the maturity date of the term loan facility. Any amounts outstanding under the revolving loan facility are due at maturity on December 14, 2015. The Bresnan Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also requires Bresnan Cable to comply with the following financial covenants: (i) a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to operating cash flow (as defined) of 7.75:1 decreasing periodically to 5.00:1 on March 31, 2014; (ii) a minimum ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense of 2.00:1 increasing periodically to 2.75:1 on March 31, 2014, and (iii) minimum liquidity (as defined) of $25,000. Bresnan Cable was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2011. Newsday LLC We currently expect that net funding and investment requirements for Newsday LLC for the next 12 months will be met with one or more of the following: cash on hand, cash generated by operating activities, interest income from the Cablevision senior notes held by Newsday Holdings LLC, capital contributions and intercompany advances. Newsday LLCs $650,000 senior secured loan facility is comprised of two components: a $525,000 10.50% fixed rate term loan facility and a $125,000 floating rate term loan facility. The senior secured loan facility matures on August 1, 2013 and, subject to certain exceptions, requires mandatory prepayments out of the proceeds of certain sales of property or assets, insurance proceeds and debt and equity issuances. No mandatory prepayments were required prior to July 29, 2011, and the amount of prepayments thereafter are limited to $105,000 in the aggregate prior to July 29, 2012 and $140,000 in the aggregate prior to the maturity date. Optional prepayments are also permitted, subject to specified prepayment premiums. (83) Table of Contents The principal financial covenant for the senior secured loan facility is a minimum liquidity test of $25,000, which is tested bi annually on June 30 and December 31. The senior secured loan facility also contains other affirmative and negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, including limitations on indebtedness (other than permitted senior indebtedness (as defined) not exceeding $50,000 and permitted subordinated indebtedness (as defined) to be used for investments not to exceed $100,000), investments (other than investments out of excess cash flow and out of the proceeds of the Cablevision senior notes in excess of the outstanding borrowings and out of a $40,000 basket), and dividends and other restricted payments (other than in respect of management and guarantee fees and restricted payments out of excess cash flow and out of the proceeds of the Cablevision senior notes in excess of the outstanding borrowings). Certain of the covenants applicable to CSC Holdings under the Newsday LLC senior secured loan facility are similar to the covenants applicable to CSC Holdings under its outstanding senior notes. Borrowings by Newsday LLC under its senior secured loan facility are guaranteed by Newsday Holdings LLC, NMG Holdings, Inc. and CSC Holdings on a senior unsecured basis and secured by a lien on the assets of Newsday LLC, and the Cablevision senior notes receivable held by Newsday Holdings LLC. Newsday LLC will generally be prohibited from using the proceeds received from any repayment of the Cablevision senior notes contributed to Newsday Holdings LLC by CSC Holdings to acquire non publicly traded notes or debt instruments of Cablevision or CSC Holdings, and Newsday LLC will be required under its senior secured loan facility to maintain cash or cash equivalents or publicly traded notes or debt instruments of Cablevision or CSC Holdings with an aggregate principal amount that exceeds the then outstanding borrowings by Newsday LLC under its senior secured loan facility. Newsday LLC was in compliance with all of its financial covenants under its credit agreement as of December 31, 2011. Capital Expenditures The following table provides details of the Companys capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 Capital Expenditures Customer premise equipment $ 203,107 $ 300,221 Scalable infrastructure 217,066 180,562 Line extensions 40,240 36,137 Upgrade/rebuild 37,013 19,701 Support 156,698 145,153 Total Cable Television 654,124 681,774 Optimum Lightpath 106,163 98,154 Total Telecommunications 760,287 779,928 Other 54,520 43,317 Total Cablevision $ 814,807 $ 823,245 Capital expenditures for 2011 decreased $8,438 (1%) as compared to 2010. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in customer premise equipment of $129,594 due to lower expenditures for set top boxes, partially offset by an increase in scalable infrastructure of $22,589 primarily due to enhancements to our network and data transmitting facilities for our high speed data and voice services in the New York metropolitan service area. The remaining increase relates to capital expenditures from the newly acquired Bresnan Cable system operations of $78,287 and other net increases from Optimum Lightpath and businesses in our Other segment.

On June 30, 2011, Cablevision completed the AMC Networks Distribution. As part of the AMC Networks Distribution, a refinancing of AMC Networks created new debt, a portion of which was used to repay all outstanding debt (excluding capital leases) of Rainbow National Services and approximately $1,250,000 of the new AMC Networks debt was issued to CSC Holdings which was used to satisfy and discharge $1,250,000 of outstanding borrowings under the Restricted Groups revolving loan facility.

Managing our Interest Rate and Equity Price Risk Interest Rate Risk To manage interest rate risk, we have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We monitor the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. We diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. Interest rate risk is primarily a result of exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads. All interest rate swap contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Equity Price Risk We have entered into derivative contracts to hedge our equity price risk and monetize the value of our shares of common stock of Comcast Corporation. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. (88) Table of Contents See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for information on how we participate in changes in the market price of the stocks underlying these derivative contracts. All of our monetization transactions are obligations of our wholly owned subsidiaries that are not part of the Restricted Group; however, CSC Holdings provides guarantees of the subsidiaries ongoing contract payment expense obligations and potential payments that could be due as a result of an early termination event (as defined in the agreements). The guarantee exposure approximates the net sum of the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and the equity collar. All of our equity derivative contracts are carried at their current fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in value reflected in our consolidated statements of income, and all of the counterparties to such transactions currently carry investment grade credit ratings. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2011 08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU No. 2011 08 is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a "qualitative" assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. ASU No. 2011 08 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU No. 2011 04 provides amendments to Topic 820 that change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. ASU No. 2011 04 is to be applied prospectively and was effective for the Company on January 1, 2012. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk All dollar amounts, except per subscriber, per unit and per share data, included in the following discussion under this Item 7A are presented in thousands. Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the shares of Comcast Corporation common stock held by us. We have entered into equity derivative contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities. These contracts, at maturity, are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price. The contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed. The contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract, among other factors. If any one of these contracts is terminated prior to its scheduled maturity date due to the occurrence of an event specified in the contract, we would be obligated to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair values of the underlying stock and equity collar, calculated at the termination date. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have an early termination shortfall relating to any of these contracts. (89) Table of Contents The underlying stock and the equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value. The carrying value of our collateralized indebtedness amounted to $455,938 at December 31, 2011. At maturity, the contracts provide for the option to deliver cash or shares of Comcast common stock, with a value determined by reference to the applicable stock price at maturity. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $509,234. Assuming a 10% change in price, the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately $50,923. As of December 31, 2011, the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the equity derivative contracts entered into to partially hedge the equity price risk of our holdings of Comcast common stock aggregated $4,364, a net payable position. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a net gain on our outstanding equity derivative contracts of $1,454 and recorded unrealized gains of $37,371 on our holdings of Comcast common stock that we held during the period. Fair Value of Equity Derivative Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2010, net payable position $ (59,300 ) Change in fair value, net 1,454 Settlement of contracts 53,482 Fair value as of December 31, 2011, net payable position $ (4,364 ) The maturity, number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity, hedge price per share, and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via an equity derivative prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table: # of Shares Hedge Price Cap Price(b) Security Deliverable Maturity per Share(a) Low High Comcast 8,069,934 2012 $ 17.57 $18.85 $ 21.09 $ 22.62 13,407,684 2013 $ 20.52 $24.94 $ 24.63 $ 29.92 (a) Represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation. Also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts. (b) Represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation. Fair Value of Debt: Based on the level of interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2011, the fair value of our fixed rate debt of $7,749,426 was more than its carrying value of $7,207,560 by $541,866. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities. Our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current LIBOR based market rates and thus their carrying values approximate fair value. The effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2011 would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by $364,768 to $8,114,194. This estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities. Interest Rate Swap Contracts: Our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund the approximately $3 billion special dividend paid in 2006, our working capital, capital expenditures, and other operational and investment requirements. To manage interest rate risk, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates. Such contracts effectively fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to limit the exposure against the risk of rising rates and or effectively convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to permit the Company to realize lower interest expense in a declining interest rate environment. We do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes. The Company monitors the financial institutions that are counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts and we only enter into interest rate swap contracts with financial institutions that are rated investment grade. We diversify our swap contracts among various counterparties to mitigate exposure to any single financial institution. All such contracts are carried at their fair values on our consolidated balance sheets, with changes in fair value reflected in our consolidated statements of income. (90) Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, CSC Holdings was party to several interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2,600,000 that effectively fixed borrowing rates on a portion of the Companys floating rate debt. As of December 31, 2011, our outstanding interest rate swap contracts had a fair value and carrying value of $55,383, a net liability position, as reflected under liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet. Assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at December 31, 2011 would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately $3,313 to a liability of $58,696. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a net loss on interest swap contracts of $7,973, as detailed in the table below: Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap Contracts Fair value as of December 31, 2010, a net liability position $ (167,278 ) Cash payments, net 119,868 Change in fair value, net (7,973 ) Fair value as of December 31, 2011, a net liability position $ (55,383 )
