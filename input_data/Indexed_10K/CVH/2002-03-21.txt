Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. General Overview We are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately 1.84 million members. We operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans serving 14 states, primarily in the MidAtlantic, Midwest and Southeast regions. We offer employers a broad range of commercial managed care products that vary with respect to the level of benefits provided, the costs paid by employers and members, and the extent to which members access to providers is subject to referral or preauthorization requirements. We offer underwritten or risk products, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and point of service (POS) plans. In addition, we recently began offering defined contribution health plans. Our risk products also include statesponsored managed Medicaid programs and Medicare+Choice programs in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. For our risk products, we receive premiums in exchange for assuming underwriting risks and performing sales, marketing and administrative functions. We also offer nonrisk products, including access to our provider networks and management services, to employers that selfinsure employee health benefits. The management services we provide typically include network management, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. For our nonrisk products, we receive fees for the access to our provider networks and the management services we provide, but we do not have underwriting risk. On May 16, 2001, we began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol CVH. Previously, we had been trading on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker symbol CVTY. Revenues We generate revenues from managed care premiums and management services. Our managed care premiums are derived from our commercial risk products and our government programs. Our commercial managed care premium revenues are comprised of premiums from our commercial HMO products and flexible provider products, including PPO and POS products for which we assume full underwriting risk. Premiums for such commercial PPO and POS products are typically lower than HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and copayments that are required of the PPO and POS members. Premium rates for commercial HMO products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings. While we have not had such filings modified, no assurance can be given that approvals for rate submissions will continue. The public sector managed care premium revenues consist of premiums from our Medicare and Medicaid products. We provide comprehensive health benefits to members participating in government programs and receive premium payments from federal and state governments. Premium rates for the Medicaid and Medicare products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action. During the three years ended December 31, 2001, we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due primarily to membership increases from acquisitions. Additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts, geographic expansion and increased product offerings. One such product offering was the expansion of our PPO risk product to all of our health plans in 2000. Another new product offering was the introduction of our HealthAssurance Flex product in our Pennsylvania market in 2001. Our management services revenues result from operations in which our health plans provide administrative and other services to selfinsured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected HMO coverage. We receive an administrative fee for these services, but do not assume underwriting risk. Certain of our management services contracts include performance and utilization management standards that affect the fees received for these services. 23 In addition, we offer a PPO product to other third party payors, under which we provide rental of and access to our PPO network, claims repricing and utilization review, and do not assume underwriting risk. We recognized management services revenue in 1999 under a Marketing Services Agreement, Management Services Agreement and PPO Access Agreement with Principal. These agreements either have expired or have been terminated as of December 31, 1999. Expenses Our primary operating expenses are medical expense, selling, general and administrative expense and depreciation and amortization expense. Our medical expense includes medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation payments. Medical expense also includes an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). In determining our IBNR liabilities, we employ plan by plan standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to the plans membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider network. We also consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. Estimates are reviewed by our underwriting, finance and accounting personnel and other appropriate plan and corporate personnel. Judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the estimated amounts. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience, changes in the delivery system, changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term. We continually monitor and review our IBNR reserves, and as actual settlements are made or accruals adjusted, reflect these differences in current operations. We currently believe that our estimates for IBNR liabilities are adequate to satisfy our ultimate medical claims liability after all medical claims have been reported. In addition to the procedures for determining reserves as discussed above, we review the actual payout of claims relating to prior period accruals. Medical costs are affected by a variety of factors, including the severity and frequency of claims. These factors are difficult to predict and may not be entirely within our control. We continually refine our actuarial practices to incorporate new cost events and trends. Membership As of December 31, 2001, we had 1,522,198 members for whom we assume underwriting risk (risk members) and 318,528 members of selfinsured employers for whom we provide administrative services but do not assume underwriting risk (nonrisk members). The following tables show the total membership, in continuing operations, as of December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999.

Our business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Prior to December 31, 2001, goodwill was amortized over a useful life of 35 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we will no longer amortize goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases was allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of five to fifteen years. 25 The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2001 (in thousands): Business Combinations Effective Date Market Purchase Price Carelink Health Plans (Carelink) October 1, 1999 West Virginia $ 8,400 PrimeONE, Inc.

(2) The final KaiserKC purchase price will be determined following a one year transition period. In the fourth quarter of 1999, we notified the Indiana Department of Insurance of our intention to close our subsidiary, Coventry Health Care of Indiana, Inc. The Indiana health plan did not operate profitably or demonstrate good prospects for future growth. Although closing the health plan did not have a substantial effect on consolidated earnings, it did allow us to focus resources and management attention on our other markets. Our transition plan gave employers and members ample time to obtain health care coverage through one of the many other companies operating in Indiana. Effective December 23, 2001, our license to operate the Indiana health plan had been withdrawn from the state. As a result of the cost associated with exiting the Indiana market, we recorded a reserve of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 1999. We have expended substantially all of the reserve as of December 31, 2001. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by us, medical malpractice actions, and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2001 may result in the assertion of additional claims. With respect to medical malpractice, we carry professional malpractice and general liability insurance for each of our operations on a claimsmade basis with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. On April 16, 2001, we were served with an Amended Complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, MDL No. 1334, styled In Re: Humana, Inc., Managed Care Litigation, Charles B. Shane, M.D., et al. vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This matter is a purported class action lawsuit filed by a group of health care providers against our Company and 11 other defendants in the managed care field. The lawsuit alleges multiple violations of RICO, violations of the prompt pay statutes in certain states and breaches of contract for failure to pay claims. The lawsuit seeks declaratory, injunctive, compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution, costs, fees and interest payments. Although we cannot predict the outcome, we believe this suit is without merit and intend to defend our position vigorously. 26 We may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving RICO and the ERISA, generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care. Although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits, we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits. Our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations. Results of Operations The following table (in thousands, except percentages and membership data) is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. Increase Increase 2001 2000 (Decrease) 2000 1999 (Decrease) Operating revenues: Managed care premiums $ 3,082,825 $ 2,556,953 $ 525,872 $ 2,556,953 $ 2,082,075 $ 474,878 Management services 64,420 47,957 16,463 47,957 80,297 (32,340) Total operating revenues 3,147,245 2,604,910 542,335 2,604,910 2,162,372 442,538 Operating expenses: Medical costs $ 2,650,993 $ 2,192,899 $ 458,094 $ 2,192,899 $ 1,792,652 $ 400,247 Selling, general and administrative 379,234 330,899 48,335 330,899 297,922 32,977 Depreciation and amortization 25,910 27,026 (1,116) 27,026 28,205 (1,179) Other charges (8,429) 8,429 (8,429) (4,262) (4,167) Total operating expenses 3,056,137 2,542,395 513,742 2,542,395 2,114,517 427,878 Operating earnings 91,108 62,515 28,593 62,515 47,855 14,660 Net earnings $ 84,407 $ 61,340 $ 23,067 $ 61,340 $ 43,435 $ 17,905 Basic earnings per share $ 1.30 $ 1.03 $ 0.27 $ 1.03 $ 0.74 $ 0.29 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.24 $ 0.93 $ 0.31 $ 0.93 $ 0.69 $ 0.24 Medical loss ratios: Commercial 85.9% 85.4% 0.5% 85.4% 85.2% 0.2% Medicare 89.4% 89.0% 0.4% 89.0% 92.2% (3.2%) Medicaid 83.5% 83.8% (0.3%) 83.8% 81.8% 2.0% Total 86.0% 85.8% 0.2% 85.8% 86.1% (0.3%) Administrative ratios: Selling, general and administrative 12.0% 12.7% (0.7%) 12.7% 13.8% (1.1%) Membership at December 31: Commercial 1,210,739 1,170,239 40,500 1,170,239 1,010,282 159,957 Medicare 53,543 71,967 (18,424) 71,967 68,632 3,335 Medicaid 257,916 194,412 63,504 194,412 146,491 47,921 Nonrisk 318,528 276,416 42,112 276,416 237,968 38,448 Total membership 1,840,726 1,713,034 127,692 1,713,034 1,463,373 249,661 27 Comparison of 2001 to 2000 Managed care premium revenue increased in 2001 over 2000 primarily from rate increases that occurred throughout both years and from member growth, both organic and through acquisitions. Premium rates increased by an average of $11.36 over 2000 on a per member per month (PMPM) basis, to $174.50 PMPM. We will continue to be diligent in attempting to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to increase more than 14.5% on Commercial renewals in the first quarter of 2002. The acquisitions that contributed to the increase in premium revenues occurred in the fourth quarter of 2000 and in the first, second, and third quarters of 2001. Membership, and thus premium revenues, in the Medicaid program continues to increase almost exclusively from growth in existing markets, including a new product offering in the fourth quarter of 2001 in our Pennsylvania market. During 2001, we significantly increased Medicare premiums in the St. Louis market, which was the primary reason for a 54.7% membership loss in that market. Management services revenue increased in 2001 from 2000 as a result of three significant acquisitions: WellPath in the fourth quarter of 2000, Health Partners in the first quarter of 2001 and Blue Ridge in the third quarter of 2001. These three acquisitions accounted for approximately 94,000 new ASO members. Medical costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to business growth and medical trend. Business growth was primarily in the Commercial and Medicaid segments. In the Commercial segment, the increase in membership was mostly due to acquisitions throughout the 2year period. Medicaid growth was due to continuing underlying program growth. A significant portion of the Medicaid membership increase was related to a new lower cost mental health program from the state of Pennsylvania implemented towards the end of 2001. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased in 2001 primarily due to the additional expense associated with the acquired WellPath and Blue Ridge health plans. SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased due to improved operational efficiencies, continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses, premium rate increases, and acquisitions which required minimal incremental SG&A. Depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. In 2000, we recorded gains related to the Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation (AHERF) bankruptcy proceedings, as described in the Comparison of 2000 to 1999 section of this Form 10K. In 2001, we recorded no charges related to these proceedings. Other income, net of interest expense, increased in 2001 from 2000 due to increased investment income as a result of an increase in the Companys longterm investments compared to the prior year. We incurred no interest expense in 2001 due to the extinguishment of all outstanding debt in 1999. Our provision for income taxes increased in 2001 due to an increase in operating earnings and other income, net, offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 39.9% in 2000 to 38.0% in 2001. This decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning. Comparison of 2000 to 1999 Managed care premium revenue increased in 2000 over 1999 as a result of rate increases and an increase in membership in existing plans and as a result of acquisitions. The increase in managed care premium revenue was attributable primarily to premium rate increases in 2000. Acquisitions occurring in the fourth quarter of 1999 and in the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2000 also contributed to the increase in managed care premium revenue. Membership, and thus premium revenue, in the Medicare+Choice and Medicaid programs continued to grow in 2000 as a result of acquisitions and growth in existing plans. More than half of the increase in governmental program membership came from growth in existing markets. 28 Management services revenue decreased in 2000 from 1999 as a result of the expiration of our PPO Access, Marketing Services and Management Services Agreements with Principal Health Care, Inc. Medical costs increased in 2000 over 1999 due almost equally to the additional expenses associated with acquisitions and increased health care costs and utilization. Despite the increase in medical costs, our medical loss ratio decreased due to medical costs increasing at a slower rate than premiums. SG&A expense increased in 2000 from 1999, due primarily to the additional expense associated with the acquisition of the Carelink, PrimeONE, Maxicare and WellPath health plans. SG&A expense, as a percentage of total operating revenues, decreased in 2000 from 1999 due to improved operational efficiencies resulting from the completion of the consolidation of 18 service centers into four regional service centers and continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2000 from 1999 due primarily to intangible assets relating to the acquisition of health plans from Principal that were fully amortized by the end of 1999. The decrease in intangible asset amortization was partially offset by an increase in amortization of goodwill relating to acquisitions and an increase in computer software and hardware depreciation. In 1999, we recorded a charge of $2.0 million for a reserve established for the closure of our Indiana health plan. In 1998, we established a $55.0 million reserve for medical and other costs under our global capitation agreement with AHERF, a service provider that covered approximately 250,000 of our members, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998. In 1999, we reached a settlement with certain health care providers relating to claims for medical services provided to our members that were covered by AHERF. As a result of this settlement, we released $4.3 million and $6.3 million of the reserve in 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 2000, we recorded a gain of $4.1 million in connection with AHERFs bankruptcy proceedings. See Note M of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Other income, net of interest expense, increased in 2000 over 1999 due to increased investment income resulting from an increase in the amount of our shortterm and longterm investments. We incurred no interest expense in 2000 due to the extinguishment of all outstanding debt in 1999. In 1999, we incurred interest expense of $1.8 million. Our provision for income taxes increased for 2000 from 1999 due to an increase in operating earnings and other income, net, offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 42.9% in 1999 to 39.9% in 2000. This decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated Our total cash and investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments, but excluding deposits of $29.9 million restricted under state regulations, increased $192.5 million to $922.6 million at December 31, 2001 from $730.1 million at December 31, 2000. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased over the prior year due to an increase in net earnings, an increase in deferred revenue related primarily to the timing of Medicare premium payments, and an increase in medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claim payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of an increase in the amount of cash placed in short term and long term investments. Net cash used in financing activities during 2001 is primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock. 29 Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2000 as compared to 1999. This improvement was primarily a result of $52.6 million in claims runout in 1999 for the Florida and Illinois health plans that were sold in 1999 compared with minimal claims runout paid in 2000. This improvement was also a result of an increase in net earnings, an increase in accounts payable, other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2000 as compared to 1999. The decrease was due to a decrease in cash placed in shortterm and longterm investments. In 1999, more cash was placed in shortterm and longterm investments due to the implementation of an investment management program following the acquisition of certain health plans from Principal Health Care, Inc. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased in 2000 as compared to 1999. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to an increase in repurchases of our common stock. Our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk of principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA and an average contractual maturity of 3.69 years, as of December 31, 2001. We believe that since our longterm investments are availableforsale, the amount of such investments should be added to current assets when assessing our working capital and liquidity. On such basis, current assets plus longterm investments availableforsale less current liabilities increased to $379.6 million at December 31, 2001 from $285.9 million at December 31, 2000. On February 1, 2002, we announced that we completed the purchase of approximately 7.1 million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable, at that time, for approximately 3.1 million shares of our common stock, owned by Principal Health Care, Inc. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was approximately $176.1 million. The purchase of the shares and warrant from Principal ended their ownership of our common stock. We financed the stock and warrant repurchase with the proceeds from the sale of $175.0 million of our 8.125% Senior Notes due February 15, 2012. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 each year, beginning August 15, 2002. Health Plans Our HMOs and our insurance company subsidiary, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company (CH&L), are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its HMOs and CH&L. Riskbased capital (RBC) is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk profile. This calculation, approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, incorporates asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk and business risk components. Our health plans are required to submit a RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. The RBC results are used to determine whether the health plans net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile. Regulators use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions, if any, range from filing a financial corrective action plan to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC (currently 250% for CH&L). Although not all states have adopted the RBC policy, the total surplus in excess of 200% for all of our HMO subsidiaries was approximately $72.2 million at December 31, 2001, up from $41.0 million at December 31, 2000. The increase is primarily due to current year earnings from our HMO subsidiaries and the previously mentioned acquisitions, offset by dividends paid to the parent company. CH&L had excess surplus of approximately $3.4 million and $2.5 million at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. The increase is primarily due to income from 2001. 30 Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation, we had cash and investments of approximately $101.8 million and $79.1 million at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively, which are available to make interest or principal payments on the senior notes or any other debt that we may have, to make loans to or investments in subsidiaries, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We have entered into agreements with certain of our regulated subsidiaries to provide additional capital, if necessary, to prevent the subsidiarys impairment of net worth requirements. Other Projected capital investments in 2002 of approximately $13.0 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communications systems. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules, as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which, among other things, impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data, including a member`s transactions with health care providers and payors, as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers. The privacy standards were issued on December 28, 2000, and the final privacy regulations became effective on April 14, 2001. The compliance date is April 14, 2003. As of December 31, 2001, we had spent approximately $845,000 on compliance matters. We anticipate spending approximately $4.6 million in 2002, approximately $1.7 million of which we expect will be capitalized, related to our compliance with the electronic transaction code sets, provider identifier standards, and security and patient information privacy standards. The nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to three months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. The demand for our products and services are subject to many economical fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. Please refer to the Risk Factors section in this Form 10K for more information. Management believes that our cash flows generated from operations, cash and investments, and excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, and debt interest costs at least through December 31, 2002. RiskSensitive Financial Instruments and Position We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. These policies include an emphasis on credit quality, management of portfolio duration, maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions. Our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses. Gains or losses would be realized upon the sale of these investments. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ. Increase (Decrease) in fair value of portfolio given an interest rate (decrease) increase of X basis points (in thousands) (300) (200) (100) 100 200 300 2001 $ 56,075 $ 37,383 $ 18,692 $ (18,692) $ (37,383) $ (56,075) 2000 $ 32,304 $ 21,536 $ 10,768 $ (10,768) $ (21,536) $ (32,304) 31 Share Repurchase Program On December 20, 1999, we announced a program to purchase up to 5% of our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. We purchased 684,343 and 826,200 shares of our common stock in 2001 and 2000, respectively, for the treasury at an aggregate cost of $9.5 million and $6.4 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. These shares do not include the approximate 7.1 million shares purchased from Principal Health Care, Inc. previously mentioned. We had approximately 65.6 million diluted shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2001. Legislation and Regulation Numerous proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform. Some proposals, if enacted, could among other things, restrict our ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers. Certain reform proposals favor the growth of managed health care, while others would adversely affect managed care. Although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the shortterm. Pursuant to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 mandate, the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information on December 20, 2000, effective April 14, 2003. We expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the compliance date. The Department of Health and Human Services also released its final rule for electronic data standards on August 17, 2000, effective October 17, 2000. We expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the compliance date. Insurance We maintain general liability and professional liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are appropriate. Until recently, we also maintained medical excess stoploss reinsurance coverage covering a portion of the medical risk we have underwritten through our risk products. We no longer maintain stoploss reinsurance coverage because we do not believe it is cost efficient to maintain it in light of current conditions in the insurance market. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are ones we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates if different assumptions or information were used. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on per member contract rates and the membership in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent and based on historical trends, we estimate the amount of future retroactivity on a monthly basis and adjust revenue accordingly. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on an annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or the Company upon thirty days written notice. 32 Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the Office of Personal Management (OPM) on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. We record reserves, on an estimated basis annually, based on the appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics, and other related information as described in the Expenses section earlier in the MD&A. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, management believes that the liability is adequate. We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of LongLived Assets. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets. The provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. We do not believe this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the FASB issued two statements related to business combinations. The first statement, SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, requires all business combinations, initiated after June 30, 2001, to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the poolingofinterest method of accounting. We currently use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations, and, therefore, management believes we will not be significantly affected by the implementation of this statement. The second statement, SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill. Rather, goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test. SFAS No. 142 also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, noncompete agreements, and customer lists. Intangible assets that have indefinite lives will not be amortized, but instead will be subject to an impairment test. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 142 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002 with the exception that goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 will not be subject to amortization. Impairment reviews may result in future periodic writedowns in the period in which the impairment took place. In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138). Accordingly, a transition gain of $0.9 million, net of tax, was recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature. The adjustment was shown separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. 33 In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation (FIN) No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation an Interpretation of APB No. 25. FIN No. 44 clarifies the application of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25 for certain issues including: (a) the definition of employee for purposes of applying APB No. 25, (b) the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. In general, FIN No. 44 was effective July 1, 2000. The adoption of FIN No. 44 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB No. 101 summarizes certain of the SECs views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements. The adoption of SAB No. 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000 did not have a material affect on our financial position or results of operations. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2002 Outlook We traditionally have an organic membership growth target of 3% 5%. However, due to the loss of a large group in Wichita, a soft economy, and increased unemployment, 2002 will likely be closer to 1 2 % across all segments. We operate in highly competitive markets, but generally believe that the pricing environment is improving in our existing markets, thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to increase premiums at rates equal to or in excess of increases in our health care costs. For 2002, we will continue to pursue ways to improve our underwriting processes and oversight in both risk and management services products with the objective of increasing premium yields and profitable growth in all of our markets. Our migration of certain of our operating activities (e.g., customer service, claims processing, billing and enrollment) to regional service centers is expected to provide improved levels of service in a more costeffective manner. Management believes that existing markets have potential for growth for our commercial and governmental products. Management believes that the foregoing should result in progressive improvements in 2002, although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors, some of which may be outside of our control. Risk Factors The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Further, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 34 Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. Most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services. As a result, our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. We base the premiums we charge, at least in part, on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period. Factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include: an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals; higher than expected utilization of health care services; periodic renegotiation of hospital, physician and other provider contracts; the occurrence of catastrophes or epidemics; changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them; general inflation or economic downturns; new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs; and other unforeseen occurrences. In addition, medical claims payable in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and unpaid claims, which we call IBNR. The estimates for submitted claims and IBNR are made on an accrual basis. We believe that our reserves for IBNR are adequate to satisfy our medical claims liabilities, but we cannot assure you of this. Any adjustments to our IBNR reserves could adversely affect our results of operations. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs, we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition, government regulations and other factors. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase. A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include: reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage; reductions in work force by existing customers; increases in premiums or benefit changes; benefit changes or reductions in premiums by our competitors; our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan; and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally. Our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional health plans and successfully integrate those plans into our operations. An important part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans. During the last several years, we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions, including the acquisition of certain health plans from Principal in April 1998. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates, successfully integrate the plans we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings. The plans we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability. Our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions. 35 Competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates. We compete with other health plans for members. We believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are: price of benefits offered; location and choice of health care providers; quality of customer service; comprehensiveness of coverage offered; reputation for quality care; financial stability of the plan; and diversity of product offerings. We face competition from other managed care companies, hospitals, health care facilities and other health care providers that may have broader geographical coverage, more established reputations in our markets, greater market share, lower costs and greater financial and other resources. We depend on the services of nonexclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers, and we cannot assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future. We depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services, particularly to small employer group members. We do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers, and they typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers, and we cannot assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products at reasonable costs. Our failure to obtain costeffective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership. Our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into costeffective agreements with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs. In addition, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets. In some of our markets, there are large provider systems that have a major presence. Some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future. These provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us, place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us. Provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We cannot assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us. 36 Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations. Over the last several years, the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by: requiring us to change our products and services; increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate; or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services. Negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members. A failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business. We depend on our information systems for timely and accurate information. Failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or disruptions in our information systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, disputes with customers and providers, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences. Compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The use of patient data by all of our businesses is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, for example, imposed significant new requirements relating to maintaining the privacy of medical information. The government published regulations to implement these provisions in December 2000. Health plans must be in compliance by April 2003. The law is farreaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with the law are ongoing. Because these regulations and other similar federal, state and local laws and regulations continue to evolve, we cannot guarantee that the costs of compliance will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to change our operations significantly. We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is heavily regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that: impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions; limit premium levels; increase minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly; prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks; prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risksharing arrangements; require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits; limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider; limit contractual terms with providers, including audit, payment and termination provisions; and implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials. 37 In addition, we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations. Federal, state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We face periodic reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business. We contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in: refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts; imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions on us; loss of our right to participate in various federal programs; damage to our reputation in various markets; increased difficulty in selling our products and services; and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or HMO or to otherwise provide a service. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories, that could significantly affect our results of operations. Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to: our denial of health care benefits; vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims; disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to our nonrisk business, including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties, claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements; disputes over our copayment calculations; and customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations. In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of purported legal claims against managed care companies. Recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims. In some cases, plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic, noneconomic or punitive damages. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular. We currently have, and expect to maintain, liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur. Potential liabilities that we incur may not, however, be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage, our insurers may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis, if at all. 38 Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile. From time to time, the price and trading volume of our common stock, as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility. Companyspecific issues and developments generally in the health care industry (including the regulatory environment) and the capital markets may cause this volatility. Our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in our operating results; changes in the markets expectations about our future operating results; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; news reports relating to trends in our markets; changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business; acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry; and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur. Our indebtedness will impose restrictions on our business and operations. The indenture for our senior notes, which were issued on February 1, 2002, imposes restrictions on our business and operations. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; create or permit certain liens on our assets; sell assets; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may impose further restrictions on us. The restrictions in the indenture for our senior notes and in any future debt instruments could limit, among other things, our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the senior notes upon a change of control. In the event of a change of control of our company, we will be required, subject to certain conditions, to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior notes or that restrictions in any other debt instruments may not allow such repurchases. Our failure to purchase the senior notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior notes. Even if we are able to repurchase the senior notes in the event of a change of control, the use of our cash resources to complete the repurchase may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 39 Warburg Pincus has significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. Warburg Pincus, a private equity investment firm, currently beneficially owns 19,204,377 shares of our common stock, or approximately 32.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of its voting power, Warburg Pincus can exert significant influence over matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of a change in control or business combination of our company. Warburg Pincus may purchase additional shares of our common stock, but has agreed, effective through May 2005, not to own more than 34.9% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. When these limitations expire in May 2005, Warburg Pincus could acquire additional shares of our common stock. In addition to its ownership position, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and Warburg Pincus, Warburg Pincus designated two directors to serve on our board of directors. Pursuant to the agreement and our certificate of incorporation, Warburg Pincus had the right to designate at least two directors until such time as Warburg Pincus converted its shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock, which occurred on December 26, 2000. The agreement provides that as long as Warburg Pincus retains ownership of at least 50% of the shares of our common stock it beneficially owned at the time of its original investment in our predecessor in 1997, it will continue to have the right to designate at least one member on our board of directors. Warburg Pincus currently continues to hold all shares represented by its original investment and, therefore, currently has the right to designate one member of our board of directors. Warburg Pincus also has certain rights under the agreement to require us to register all or part of the shares of our common stock owned by Warburg Pincus. Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable. We have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may delay, discourage or prevent a merger, acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions: authorize us to issue preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders; provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than onethird of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting; provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of twothirds of our outstanding shares; provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of threefourths of our outstanding shares; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting. These provisions of our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. 40 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk Our only material risk of investments in financial instruments is in our debt securities portfolio. We invest primarily in marketable state and municipal, U.S. Government and agencies, corporate, and mortgagebacked debt securities. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138). Accordingly, a transition gain of $0.9 million, net of tax, based on the valuation at December 31, 2000, was recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature. We do not typically invest in derivative financial instruments. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. These policies include an emphasis on credit quality, management of portfolio duration, maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions. We have classified all of our investments as availableforsale. The fair value of our investments at December 31, 2001 was $640.1 million. Our investments at December 31, 2001 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair Cost Value As of December 31, 2001 Maturities: Within 1 year $ 126,867 $ 127,642 1 to 5 years 230,626 237,597 6 to 10 years 89,703 91,179 Over 10 years 181,889 183,709 Total shortterm and longterm securities $ 629,085 $ 640,127 We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuer of the debt securities we holds. The mortgagebacked securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration and Federal National Mortgage Administration. Our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses. Gains or losses would be realized upon the sale of these investments. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
