Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. General Overview We are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately 2.0 million members, excluding our network rental members discussed below, as of December 31, 2002. We operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans serving 14 states, primarily in the Mid Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast regions. We offer employers a broad range of commercial managed care products that vary with respect to the level of benefits provided, the costs paid by employers and members and the extent to which members access to providers is subject to referral or preauthorization requirements. We offer underwritten or risk products, including health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and point of service (POS) plans. In addition, we offer defined contribution health plans. Our risk products also include Medicare+Choice programs and state sponsored managed Medicaid programs in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. For our risk products, we receive premiums in exchange for assuming underwriting risks and performing sales, marketing and administrative functions. We also offer non risk products, including access to our provider networks and management services, to employers that self insure employee health benefits. The management services we provide typically include network management, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. For our non risk products, we receive fees for the access to our provider networks and the management services we provide, but we do not have underwriting risk. In addition, we offer a product where we rent our network of providers (network rental members) to other managed care plans or non risk employers and assume no underwriting risk and provide no management services. Revenues We generate operating revenues from managed care premiums and management services. Our managed care premiums are derived from our commercial risk products and our government programs. Our commercial managed care premium revenues are comprised of premiums from our commercial HMO products and flexible provider products, including PPO and POS products for which we assume full underwriting risk. Premiums for such commercial PPO and POS products are typically lower than HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are required of the PPO and POS members. Premium rates for Commercial HMO, POS and PPO products are reviewed by various state agencies based on rate filings. In response to this regulatory review, we may have to modify or revise our rate filings in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals. While these modifications have not been material in the past, no assurance can be given that future rate filings will be approved in the same fashion. We provide comprehensive health benefits to members participating in government programs and receive premium payments from federal and state governments. Premium rates for the Medicaid and Medicare+Choice products are established by governmental regulatory agencies and may be reduced by regulatory action. During the three years ended December 31, 2002, we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues in part due to membership increases from acquisitions. Additional membership growth was achieved through marketing efforts, geographic expansion and increased product offerings. One such product offering was the expansion of our PPO risk product to all of our health plans in 2000. Another new product offering was the introduction of our HealthAssurance Flex product in our Pennsylvania market in 2001, which was expanded to our Georgia and Iowa markets under the name Coventry Health Care Flex. We believe that our products can be adapted in order to meet customers cost reduction needs by offering a low benefit plan while still having a higher benefit plan as an option. We will offer a broad choice of products as market conditions require and to meet the needs of customers and brokers. 23 Our management services revenues result from operations in which our health plans provide administrative and other services to self insured employers and to employer group beneficiaries that have elected HMO coverage. We receive an administrative fee for these services, but do not assume underwriting risk. Certain of our management services contracts include performance and utilization management standards that if not met may cause us to incur penalties. In addition, we offer a PPO product to other third party payors, under which we provide rental of and access to our PPO network, claims repricing and utilization review, and do not assume underwriting risk. Expenses Our primary operating expenses consist of medical costs; selling, general and administrative expense; and depreciation and amortization expense. Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation payments. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). In determining our IBNR liabilities, we employ standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each markets membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider network. We also consider utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. Estimates are reviewed by our underwriting, finance and accounting personnel and other appropriate health plan and corporate personnel. Judgments are then made as to the necessity for reserves in addition to the estimated amounts. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience, changes in the delivery system, changes in pricing due to ancillary capitation and fluctuations in the claims backlog could cause these estimates to change in the near term. We continually monitor and review our IBNR reserves, and as actual settlements are made or accruals adjusted, reflect these differences in current operations. Medical costs are affected by a variety of factors, including the severity and frequency of claims. These factors are difficult to predict and may not be entirely within our control. We continually refine our actuarial practices to incorporate new cost events and trends. Membership As of December 31, 2002, we had 1.6 million risk members, 0.4 million non risk members and 0.8 million network rental members. The following tables show our total risk and non risk members as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates if different assumptions or information were used. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. We also receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare+Choice membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts typically have a one year term, subject to cancellation by the employer group or by us upon 30 days notice. Based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity and adjust our revenue and reserves accordingly. As of December 31, 2002, we maintained reserves for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $12.0 million compared with approximately $10.3 million at December 31, 2001. We also maintained reserves for doubtful accounts of approximately $2.9 million and $4.3 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The calculation for these reserves is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the reserve percentage increasing for the older receivables. We contract with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide managed health care services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program. The OPM conducts periodic audits of its contractors to, among other things, verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the Office of Personnel Management on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. We record reserves, on an estimated basis annually, based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. 25 We currently enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone on hold time, etc. Under these performance guarantees, we could be at risk for not maintaining the standards held in the contracts. The risk level varies by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month, percentage of premium, or percentage of administration fees. Risk levels are evaluated quarterly and when these performance standards are not met a liability is established. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics and other related information as described earlier in the section entitled Expenses. We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past six years. For inpatient reserves, our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates (traditional triangle based completion factors) and incurred claims estimates calculated as authorized days multiplied by per diem forecasts. For non inpatient reserves, our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates and trended per member per month estimates. For both the inpatient and non inpatient reserves, lag based estimates receive little or no credibility weighting in the more current incurral months. Credibility factors are increased for older months within the lag models since those older months have a higher completion factor and are the best indicator of our ultimate cost. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, there are certain assumptions that are used. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization, and other factors. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriately conservative. In 24 of the 25 most recent quarters, the reserve models have developed favorably. This suggests that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, provider contract changes and other components of medical cost trend. Additionally, in 2002, an independent actuarial consulting firm began reviewing our reserve models and underlying assumptions. The independent actuaries report their conclusions to the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis. Investments We account for investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in debt securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: Adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region, or other variable. The length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost. The financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer. Our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal. Rating agency downgrade of a debt security. Decrease in expected cash flows of a debt security. 26 Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short term investments and generally consist of time deposits, U.S. Treasury Notes and obligations of various states and municipalities. Long term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of debt securities. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method and states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, non compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill. Rather, goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We use three approaches to identifying the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets: the market approach, the market capitalization approach and the income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. All three approaches are reviewed together for consistency and commonality. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place. Since the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, and through December 31, 2002, we have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets. New Accounting Standards In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure as an amendment to FASB statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. This statement provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires prominent disclosure in our footnotes to the financial statements of our interim and annual reports. We currently do not expect to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation, and, accordingly, this statement did not affect our financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), and nullifies EITF Issue No. 88 10, Cost Associated with Lease Modification or Termination. SFAS No. 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at fair value only when the liability is incurred. This statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 27 In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets. The provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. This statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the FASB issued two standards related to business combinations. The first statement, SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting. SFAS No. 141 also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, non compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. We were not significantly affected by the implementation of this statement. The second statement, SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill. Rather, goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Impairment charges may result in future write downs in the period in which the impairment took place. As required, we adopted SFAS No. 142 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002, and, accordingly, goodwill was not amortized during 2002 nor did we incur an impairment charge related to goodwill. In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138). Accordingly, a transition gain of $0.9 million, net of tax, was recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature. The adjustment was shown separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Acquisitions and Dispositions During the three years ended December 31, 2002, we completed several business combinations and membership purchases. Our business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Prior to December 31, 2001, goodwill was amortized over a useful life of 35 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we no longer amortize goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases was allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of five to fifteen years. 28 The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2002. The purchase price, in thousands, of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and transition costs. Purchase Effective Date Market Price Business Combinations PrimeONE, Inc.

Commercial premium rates increased by an average of $20.75 over 2001 on a per member per month (PMPM) basis, to $183.80 PMPM. 30 Management services revenue increased in 2002 from 2001 as a result of the previously discussed acquisitions. In particular, the Health Partners, Blue Ridge, NewAlliance and Mid America acquisitions accounted for approximately 113,800 new non risk members. Medical costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to membership growth, as discussed above, and medical trend. Our commercial medical trend for the year ended 2002 was 8.6% and the average trend for the three year period ended December 31, 2002 was 10.1%. Our medical loss ratio improved in 2002 in our Commercial and Medicare product lines as a result of rate increases outpacing medical trends. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased in 2002 primarily due to acquisitions, an increase in fees paid to brokers and incremental salary expense related to the expansion of our customer service organization. During 2002, we opened a new regional service center in Bismarck, North Dakota to perform customer service functions related to the Mid America acquisition and to create additional capacity for future acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense increased slightly by 0.2% to 12.2% for 2002. Depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in January 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill but rather test for impairment at least once a year. In 2001, we amortized $7.5 million in goodwill. We did not incur any impairment charges during 2002. Senior notes interest and amortization expense was incurred in 2002 due to the issuance of our senior notes on February 1, 2002, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Other income, net decreased in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to the change in valuation of a derivative instrument. We recorded a gain in 2001 and a loss in 2002 related to this derivative. The decrease is also related to a decrease in the amortization of discounts on investments, offset by an increase in interest income due to cash placed in long term investments to achieve higher yields. Our provision for income taxes increased in 2002 due to an increase in operating earnings, offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from 38.0% in 2001 to 35.5% in 2002. This decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning and due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002. Comparison of 2001 to 2000 Managed care premium revenue increased in 2001 over 2000 primarily from rate increases that occurred throughout both years and from membership growth, both organically and through acquisitions. Premium rates increased by an average of $11.36 over 2000 on a per member per month (PMPM) basis, to $174.50 PMPM. The acquisitions that contributed to the increase in premium revenues occurred in the fourth quarter of 2000 and in the first, second and third quarters of 2001. Membership, and thus premium revenues, in the Medicaid program continued to increase almost exclusively from growth in existing markets, including a new product offering in the fourth quarter of 2001 in our Pennsylvania market. During 2001, we significantly increased Medicare premiums in the St. Louis market, which was the primary reason for a 54.7% membership loss in that market. Management services revenue increased in 2001 from 2000 as a result of three significant acquisitions: WellPath in the fourth quarter of 2000, Health Partners in the first quarter of 2001 and Blue Ridge in the third quarter of 2001. These three acquisitions accounted for 94,000 new non risk members. Medical costs increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to business growth and medical trend. Business growth was primarily in the Commercial and Medicaid segments. In the Commercial segment, the increase in membership was mostly due to acquisitions throughout the 2 year period. Medicaid growth was due to continuing underlying program growth. A significant portion of the Medicaid membership increase was related to a new lower cost mental health program that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania implemented towards the end of 2001. 31 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased in 2001 primarily due to the additional expense associated with the acquired WellPath and Blue Ridge health plans. SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenue, decreased due to improved operational efficiencies, continued management scrutiny of administrative expenses, premium rate increases and acquisitions which required minimal incremental SG&A. Depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Other income, net increased in 2001 from 2000 due to increased investment income as a result of an increase in our long term investments compared to the prior year. We incurred no interest expense in 2001. Our provision for income taxes increased in 2001 due to an increase in operating earnings and other income, net, offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from 39.9% in 2000 to 38.0% in 2001. This decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated Our total cash and investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $17.9 million restricted under state regulations, increased $178.6 million to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002 from $922.6 million at December 31, 2001. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased over the prior year due to an increase in net earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. The latter was a result of increases in additional selling, general and administrative liabilities related to our acquisitions and business growth throughout 2001 and 2002 and an increase in our deferred tax liability as shown in Note F to our consolidated financial statements. These increases were offset by a decrease in total medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claims payments. Also, in 2001 we received 13 months worth of Medicare premium payments as a result of the timing of CMS payments and only 12 months of premium payments were received during 2002 which led to the decrease in our deferred revenue. Net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2002 due to an increase in the amount of cash placed into short term and long term investments. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2002 we made payments related to acquisitions, net of transaction costs and cash acquired, of approximately $40.9 million compared to cash acquired, net of transaction costs and cash payments, of approximately $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Net cash used in financing activities during 2002 increased over the prior year as a result of an increase in repurchases of our common stock. During 2002, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock, as discussed below in our Share Repurchase Program section, compared to approximately 0.7 million shares during 2001. On February 1, 2002, we completed the purchase of approximately 7.1 million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable, at that time, for approximately 3.1 million shares of our common stock, owned by Principal Health Care, Inc. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was approximately $176.1 million. The purchase of the shares and warrant from Principal ended their ownership of our common stock. We financed the stock and warrant repurchase with the proceeds from the sale of $175.0 million of our 8.125% Senior Notes due February 15, 2012. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 each year. The first interest payment of $7.7 million was made on August 14, 2002. The Senior Notes contain certain covenants, including covenants regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and restricting transactions with affiliates, sales of assets and consolidations or mergers. We have complied with all covenants under the Senior Notes. 32 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2001 increased over 2000 due to an increase in net earnings, an increase in deferred revenue related primarily to the timing of Medicare premium payments and an increase in medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claim payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of an increase in the amount of cash placed in short term and long term investments. Net cash used in financing activities during 2001 is primarily due to the repurchases of our common stock. Our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk of principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA+ and an average contractual maturity of 3.76 years, as of December 31, 2002. We believe that since our long term investments are available for sale, the amount of such investments should be added to current assets when assessing our working capital and liquidity. On such basis, current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to $498.0 million at December 31, 2002 from $379.6 million at December 31, 2001. Health Plans Our HMOs, our insurance company subsidiary, Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company (CH&L), and our captive subsidiary, CHC Risk Retention Group, Inc. (CRRG), are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its HMOs, CH&L and CRRG. During 2002, the parent collected $36.7 million in dividends from our subsidiaries subject to such regulatory restrictions. Risk based capital (RBC) is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk profile. This calculation, approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), incorporates asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk and business risk components. Our health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. The RBC results are used to determine whether the health plans net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile. Regulators use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions, if any, range from filing a financial corrective action plan to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted an RBC policy that recommends that health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC (currently 250% for CH&L). Although not all states have adopted the RBC policy, we maintain all of our health plans at this standard. The total surplus in excess of 200% of RBC for all of our HMO subsidiaries was approximately $155.8 million at December 31, 2002, up from $72.1 million at December 31, 2001. These total statutory reserves for our HMO subsidiaries, as a percentage of RBC, was 331% and 267% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase is primarily due to current year earnings from our HMO subsidiaries and the previously mentioned acquisitions, offset by dividends paid to the parent company. CH&L had surplus in excess of 250% of RBC of approximately $24.1 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The total statutory reserve for CH&L, as a percentage of RBC, was 609% and 283% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase is primarily due to 2002 income. CRRG had surplus in excess of 200% of RBC of approximately $1.2 million at December 31, 2002. The total statutory reserve for CRRG, as a percentage of RBC, was 325% as of December 31, 2002. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation, we had cash and investments of approximately $86.7 million and $101.8 million at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively. The decrease in non regulated cash and investments is primarily a result of payments made to repurchase shares of our own common stock and payments for acquisitions offset by ordinary operating activities. These funds are available to make interest or principal payments on the senior notes or any other debt that we may incur, to make loans to or investments in subsidiaries, to fund acquisitions, for stock repurchases and for general corporate purposes. A significant portion of these funds is dependent upon operating profits generated by our regulated operating subsidiaries and the ability to receive dividends from those subsidiaries. Although there is no assurance, we expect to receive regulatory approval for future dividend payments. We have entered into agreements with certain of our regulated subsidiaries to provide additional capital, if necessary, to prevent the subsidiarys impairment of net worth requirements. During 2002, we made capital contributions of $29.6 million to our HMO subsidiaries. This includes a $10.0 million contribution made to a subsidiary to increase statutory reserves above 200% even though the subsidiary is operating in a state that has not adopted the 200% RBC policy. 33 Other As of December 31, 2002, we are contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Senior notes $ 175,000 $ $ $ $ 175,000 Operating leases 93,516 15,692 29,111 21,228 27,485 Less sublease income (4,073) (1,300) (2,047) (726) Total contractual obligations $ 264,443 $ 14,392 $ 27,064 $ 20,502 $ 202,485 Refer to Note I to our consolidated financial statement for disclosure related to our operating leases. Projected capital investments in 2003 of approximately $13.7 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules, as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which, among other things, impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data, including a members transactions with health care providers and payors, as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers. The privacy standards were issued on December 28, 2000, and becomes mandatory on April 14, 2003. As of December 31, 2002, we had spent approximately $5.0 million on compliance matters during 2001 and 2002. We anticipate spending approximately $5.5 million in 2003, approximately $1.1 million of which we expect will be capitalized, related to our compliance with the electronic transaction code sets, provider identifier standards and security and patient information privacy standards. The nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to three months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. The demand for our products and services are subject to many economical fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. Please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that our cash flows generated from operations, cash and investments and excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures and debt interest costs at least through December 31, 2003. Risk Sensitive Financial Instruments and Position We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. These policies include an emphasis on credit quality, management of portfolio duration, maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions. 34 Our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ. Increase (Decrease) in fair value of portfolio given an interest rate (decrease) increase of X basis points As of December 31, 2002 (in thousands) (300) (200) (100) 100 200 300 $ 90,904 $ 60,603 $ 30,301 $ (30,301) $ (60,603) $ (90,904) Share Repurchase Program On December 20, 1999, we announced a program to purchase up to 5% of our outstanding common stock. In August 2002, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase up to an additional 5% of our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, we purchased 2.2 million shares of our common stock in 2002 at an aggregate cost of $65.5 million. The total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under the program, including the new authorization, was approximately 2.5 million as of December 31, 2002. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by us, medical malpractice actions and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2002 may result in the assertion of additional claims. We carry general liability insurance for each of our operations on a claims made basis with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves. As a result of significant premium increases required by insurers to renew our professional malpractice coverage, we formed a captive subsidiary to provide coverage for these events. Our captive subsidiary provides up to $5 million in coverage for each event and up to $10 million in coverage for each event that is a class action. The captive has an aggregate policy limit of $15 million. On top of the captives per event limit of $5 million, we are co insured with our commercial carrier for an additional $10 million. Each year we will re evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring these types of claims. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We are a defendant in the provider track in the Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, MDL No. 1334, styled in re: Humana, Inc., Charles B. Shane, MD, et al. vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This action was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against us and twelve other companies in the managed care field. In its fourth amended complaint, the plaintiffs have alleged violations of RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these RICO claims, the complaint includes counts for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. We have filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims because they fail to state a cause of action or, in the alternative, to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in our physician contracts. The trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians; however, we were not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant. The plaintiffs are currently pursuing class discovery against us and will then file their motion for class certification as to us. The defendants who were subject to the certification order have filed an appeal with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals which has been granted. Although we can not predict the outcome, we believe that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and we intend to defend our position. 35 We may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving RICO and the ERISA, generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care. Although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits, we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits. Our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations. Legislation and Regulation Numerous proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and various state legislatures relating to health care reform. Some proposals, if enacted, could among other things, restrict our ability to raise prices and to contract independently with employers and providers. Certain reform proposals favor the growth of managed health care, while others would adversely affect managed care. Although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the short term. Pursuant to a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 mandate, the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule regarding standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information on December 20, 2000, effective April 14, 2003. We expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the compliance date. The Department of Health and Human Services also released its final rule for electronic data standards on August 17, 2000, effective October 17, 2000. We expect to institute all necessary modifications to systems and business processes by the October 16, 2003 compliance date. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not assure you that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2003 Outlook As a result of an improved sales force, a varied product offering, an improved underwriting process and superior customer service, we have increased our organic membership growth target to 5% for the year 2003. We operate in highly competitive markets, but believe that the pricing environment is rational in our existing markets, thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases. We will continue to be diligent in attempting to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in 2003, although at a slower pace than 2002. For 2003, we will continue to pursue ways to improve our underwriting processes and oversight in both risk and management services products with the objective of increasing premium yields and profitable growth in all of our markets. Management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products. We currently anticipate reducing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to a rate not to exceed 11.6% in 2003, excluding the effect of any future acquisitions, through medical claims auto adjudication, improved customer service, e commerce initiatives and by slowing the increases in broker fees. Management believes that the foregoing should result in progressive earnings improvements in 2003, although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors, some of which may be outside of our control. 36 Risk Factors The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Further, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. Most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services. As a result, our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. We base the premiums we charge, at least in part, on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period. Factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include: an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals; higher than expected utilization of health care services; periodic renegotiation of hospital, physician and other provider contracts; the occurrence of catastrophes or epidemics; changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them; general inflation or economic downturns; new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs; and other unforeseen occurrences. In addition, medical claims payable in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and unpaid claims, which we call IBNR. The estimates for submitted claims and IBNR are made on an accrual basis. We believe that our reserves for IBNR are adequate to satisfy our medical claims liabilities, but we can not assure you of this. Any adjustments to our IBNR reserves could adversely affect our results of operations. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs, we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition, government regulations and other factors. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase. A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include: reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage; reductions in work force by existing customers; increases in premiums or benefit changes; benefit changes or reductions in premiums by our competitors; our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan; and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally. 37 Our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional health plans and successfully integrate those plans into our operations. An important part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans. During the last several years, we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions, including the acquisition of certain health plans from Principal Health Care, Inc. in April 1998. We can not assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates, successfully integrate the plans we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings. The plans we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability. Our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions. Competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates. We compete with other health plans for members. We believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are: price of benefits offered; location and choice of health care providers; quality of customer service; comprehensiveness of coverage offered; reputation for quality care; financial stability of the plan; and diversity of product offerings. We face competition from other managed care companies, hospitals, health care facilities and other health care providers that may have broader geographical coverage, more established reputations in our markets, greater market share, lower costs and greater financial and other resources. We depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers, and we can not assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future. We depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services, particularly to small employer group members. We do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers and they typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers, and we can not assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products at reasonable costs. Our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership. Our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs. In addition, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets. In some of our markets, there are large provider systems that have a major presence. Some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future. These provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us, place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us. Provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We can not assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us. 38 Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations. Over the last several years, the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by: requiring us to change our products and services; increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate; or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services. Negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members. A failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business. We depend on our information systems for timely and accurate information. Failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or disruptions in our information systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, disputes with customers and providers, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences. Compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The use of patient data by all of our businesses is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, for example, imposed significant new requirements relating to maintaining the privacy of medical information. The government published regulations to implement these provisions in December 2000. Health plans must be in compliance by April 2003. The law is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with the law are ongoing. Because these regulations and other similar federal, state and local laws and regulations continue to evolve, we can not guarantee that the costs of compliance will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to change our operations significantly. We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is heavily regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that: impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions; limit premium levels; increase minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly; prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks; prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits; limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider; limit contractual terms with providers, including audit, payment and termination provisions; and implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials. 39 In addition, we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations. Federal, state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business. We can not predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We face periodic reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business. We contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in: refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts; imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions on us; loss of our right to participate in various federal programs; damage to our reputation in various markets; increased difficulty in selling our products and services; and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or HMO or to otherwise provide a service. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories, that could significantly affect our results of operations. Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to: our denial of health care benefits; vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims; disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to our non risk business, including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties, claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements; disputes over our copayment calculations; and customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations. In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of purported legal claims against managed care companies. Recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims. In some cases, plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic, non economic or punitive damages. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In the event that a significant damage award does occur it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We can not determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular. We currently have, and expect to maintain, liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur. Potential liabilities that we incur may not, however, be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage, our insurers may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate. We can not assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis, if at all. 40 Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile. From time to time, the price and trading volume of our common stock, as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility. Company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry (including the regulatory environment) and the capital markets may cause this volatility. Our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in our operating results; changes in the markets expectations about our future operating results; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; news reports relating to trends in our markets; changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business; acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry; and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur. Our indebtedness will impose restrictions on our business and operations. The indenture for our senior notes, which were issued on February 1, 2002, imposes restrictions on our business and operations. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; create or permit certain liens on our assets; sell assets; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may impose further restrictions on us. The restrictions in the indenture for our senior notes and in any future debt instruments could limit, among other things, our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the senior notes upon a change of control. In the event of a change of control of our company, we will be required, subject to certain conditions, to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior notes or that restrictions in any other debt instruments may not allow such repurchases. Our failure to purchase the senior notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior notes. Even if we are able to repurchase the senior notes in the event of a change of control, the use of our cash resources to complete the repurchase may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Warburg Pincus has significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with your interests as a stockholder. Warburg Pincus, a private equity investment firm, currently beneficially owns 10,127,384 shares of our common stock, or approximately 17.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2002. As a result of its voting power, Warburg Pincus may be able to exert significant influence over matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of a change in control or business combination of our company. Warburg Pincus may purchase additional shares of our common stock, but has agreed, effective through May 2005, not to own more than 34.9% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. When these limitations expire in May 2005, Warburg Pincus could acquire additional shares of our common stock. 41 In addition to its ownership position, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and Warburg Pincus, Warburg Pincus designated two directors to serve on our board of directors. Pursuant to the agreement and our certificate of incorporation, Warburg Pincus had the right to designate at least two directors until such time as Warburg Pincus converted its shares of our Series A convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock, which occurred on December 26, 2000. The agreement provides that as long as Warburg Pincus retains ownership of at least 50% of the shares of our common stock it beneficially owned at the time of its original investment in our predecessor in 1997, it will continue to have the right to designate at least one member on our board of directors. As of December 31, 2002, Warburg Pincus continued to beneficially own 100% of the shares represented by its original investment and, therefore, currently has the right to designate one member of our board of directors. Warburg Pincus also has certain rights under the agreement to require us to register all or part of the shares of our common stock owned by Warburg Pincus. Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable. We have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may delay, discourage or prevent a merger, acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions: authorize us to issue preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders; provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting; provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares; provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting. These provisions of our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. 42 Effects of Terrorism There can be no assurance that the war on terrorism, the threat of future acts of terrorism or the related concerns of members or providers will not adversely affect our health care costs and our ability to predict and control such costs. Future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could adversely affect us through, among other things: increased utilization of health care services including, without limitation, hospital and physician services, ancillary testing and procedures, vaccinations, prescriptions for drugs, mental health services and other services; loss of membership as the result of lay offs or other in force reductions of employment; adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption of our business or operations; and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general. General Economic Conditions Changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations. The state of the economy could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums. The state of the economy has also affected the states budgets, which could result in the states attempting to reduce payments to Medicaid plans in those states in which we offer Medicaid plans, and increase taxes and assessments on our activities. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs resulting from any budgets cuts in states in which we operate. Although we have attempted to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of our membership, there can be no assurance that the effects of the current downturn in economic conditions will not cause our existing membership to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant membership loss, lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership. 43 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk Our only material risk of investments in financial instruments is in our debt securities portfolio. We invest primarily in marketable state and municipal, U.S. Government and agencies, corporate and mortgage backed debt securities. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133 (as amended by SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138). Accordingly, a transition gain of $0.9 million, net of tax, based on the valuation at December 31, 2000, was recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial instrument classified as derivative in nature. We do not typically invest in derivative financial instruments. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. These policies include an emphasis on credit quality, management of portfolio duration, maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security is considered. Debt securities with declines in value below cost due to market conditions or industry specific events where we intend and have the ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery, are not assumed to be other than temporary. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The fair value of our investments at December 31, 2002 was $932.4 million. Our investments at December 31, 2002 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair As of December 31, 2002 Cost Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 103,620 $ 104,319 1 to 5 years 335,959 353,330 5 to 10 years 240,426 250,266 Over 10 years 217,979 224,437 Total short term and long term securities $ 897,984 $ 932,352 We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration and Federal National Mortgage Administration. 44 Our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The analysis is based on a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100, 200 and 300 basis points. Changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
