Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows: ExecutiveLevel Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Risk Factors ExecutiveLevel Overview General Operations We are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately 2.4 million members, excluding network rental members, as of December 31, 2003. We operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans, insurance companies and provider networks serving 14 markets. Our operations are based in Bethesda, Maryland with our local markets primarily covering the MidAtlantic, Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. Our primary focus is owning and operating health plans with a concentration on risk business with mid sized employer groups. We operate our health plans with a local focus but with the management expertise, resources and economies of scale of a large, well capitalized company. We believe the delivery of health care benefits and services is best managed on a marketbymarket basis. Each of our health plans operates under its local market name and has local management, including sales and marketing, medical management, contracting and provider relations personnel that design and manage health benefits to meet the needs of our individual markets. We believe that our local focus enables us to quickly adapt our products and services to the needs of individual markets and maintain strong relationships with our employer customers, members and health care providers. We will continue to meet competitive challenges by offering quality products at adequate rates while maintaining our low cost structure. Highlights of 2003 Performance Membership increased 17% over the prior year. Revenue increased 27% over the prior year. Medical loss ratio of 81.2% improved 210 basis points over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, improved by 20 basis points over the prior year. Operating margin of 8.1% improved 250 basis points over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 74% over the prior year. Cash flows from operations was $323.1 million, a 55% improvement over the prior year. Total cash and investments increased to $1.4 billion, a 26% increase over the prior year. Operating Revenue and Products We generate our operating revenues from premiums for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our preferred provider organization (PPO) and point of service (POS) products are typically lower than our health maintenance organization (HMO) premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and copayments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Premium rates for our government programs, Medicare+Choice and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. 21 Table of Contents Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee for access to our provider networks and management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include network management, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. In addition, we rent our network of providers (network rental), including claims repricing and utilization review, to other managed care plans or nonrisk employers and assume no underwriting risk. During the three years ended December 31, 2003, we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due to membership increases from acquisitions. We pursue acquisitions that fit into our local market strategy and that we feel are able to operate at target margins for the long term. Acquisitions must have a manageable regulatory and business climate and have the ability to add value to our company. Additionally, membership growth was achieved organically through marketing efforts, geographic expansion and increased product offerings. Our ability to introduce products quickly to each market has helped us to expand our customer base. In particular, we have been able to a add a large variety of lower cost products, which has proven especially attractive to customers. In some instances, we have introduced products in one market that we were already administering in another. Such commonality can help not only in properly administering benefit plans from day one, but also in expediting the regulatory approval processes. Although the approval processes are unique to each state, common plan documents can provide additional efficiencies. Operating Expenses Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). Our health plans maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Most contracted primary care and specialist physicians are compensated under a discounted feeforservice arrangement. The majority of our contracts with hospitals provide for inpatient per diem or per case hospital rates. Outpatient services are contracted on a discounted feeforservice, a per case basis or in some instances a discount from charges basis. We pay ancillary providers on a fixed fee schedule or a capitation basis. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated through a national network of pharmacies at discounted rates. A small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. In addition to global capitation arrangements, we have capitation arrangements for ancillary services, such as mental health care. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze overutilization or underutilization of services and assist our health plans in providing appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization collects and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of cost effective, medically appropriate services. We operate four regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions for our plans. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices at each of our plans and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. We centralize the underwriting and product pricing functions for our health plans, which allows us to utilize our underwriting expertise and a disciplined pricing strategy at each of our plans. We believe our centralization of certain administrative functions at the corporate and regional levels gives us a competitive advantage over local market health plans that lack our resources. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have not needed to use financing methods to generate cash for operations. We have a low debt to capital ratio and while we did issue senior notes in 2002 (as described in Note H to our consolidated financial statements of this Form 10K), the entire proceeds were used to repurchase a portion of our common stock and were not used to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions and for repurchases of our common stock. 22 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The accounting policies described below are ones we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt writeoffs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and reserves accordingly. As of December 31, 2003, we maintained reserves for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $7.2 million compared with approximately $12.0 million at December 31, 2002. We also maintained reserves for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.4 million and $2.9 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The calculation for these reserves is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the reserve percentage increasing for the older receivables. The reserves have declined as a result of an improvement in the aging of our premium receivables. We also receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare+Choice membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. We contract with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide managed health care services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program. The OPM conducts periodic audits of its contractors to, among other things, verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. Our contracts are periodically reconciled by us with the OPM and could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. We record reserves, on an estimated basis annually, based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We currently enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone onhold time, etc. Under these performance guarantees, we could be at risk and may incur penalties for not maintaining the standards established in the contracts. The risk level varies by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month, percentage of premium, or percentage of administration fees. Risk levels are evaluated at least quarterly. We estimate our potential exposure and record appropriate reserves. The penalties that we have incurred have been immaterial and, although, we can not predict with precision the future effect on our results of operations of these penalties, we expect them to remain immaterial. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical claims liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported (IBNR). IBNR estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, contractual requirements, historical utilization trends and payment patterns, benefits changes, medical inflation, product mix, seasonality, membership and other relevant factors. We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. Certain situations require judgment in setting reserves, such as system conversions, processing interruptions, environmental changes or other factors. 23 Table of Contents We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. For inpatient reserves, our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates (traditional triangle based completion factors) and incurred claims estimates calculated as authorized days multiplied by per diem forecasts. For non inpatient reserves, our models use credibility weighting of lag based incurred claim estimates and trended per member per month estimates. For both the inpatient and non inpatient reserves, lag based estimates receive little or no credibility weighting in the more current incurral months. Credibility factors are increased for older months within the lag models since those older months have a higher completion factor and are the best indicator of our ultimate cost. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, there are certain assumptions that are used. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization, and other factors. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarial developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we have experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. The following table presents the components of the change in medical liabilities (Medical claims liabilities and Other medical liabilities) for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively (in thousands). 2003 2002 2001 Medical liabilities, Beginning of Period $ 558,599 $ 522,854 $ 444,887 Acquisitions 38,828 30,778 34,627 Reported medical costs Current year 3,693,821 2,985,472 2,679,337 Prior year (86,532) (65,973) (28,344) Total reported medical costs $ 3,607,289 $ 2,919,499 $ 2,650,993 Claim payments Payments for current year 3,235,902 2,527,999 2,259,523 Payments for prior year 371,624 386,533 348,130 Total claim payments $ 3,607,526 $ 2,914,532 $ 2,607,653 Medical liabilities, End of Period $ 597,190 $ 558,599 $ 522,854 Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities as of the applicable acquisition date. Subsequent changes in estimates related to the acquired balances are recorded as adjustments to the settlement account with the acquired entitys previous owner. The negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. 24 Table of Contents We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2003; however, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Assuming a hypothetical 1% variance between our December 31, 2003 estimates of medical liabilities and actual costs payable, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003, would increase or decrease by approximately $3.8 million and diluted earnings per share would increase or decrease by approximately $0.04 per share. Investments We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as availableforsale. Investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as availableforsale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The following table shows our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value, at December 31, 2003, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss State and municipal bonds $ 57,425 $ (714) $ $ $ 57,425 $ (714) US Treasury & agency securities 28,372 (161) 28,372 (161) Mortgage backed securities 20,923 (391) 3,270 (21) 24,193 (412) Asset backed securities Corporate debt and other securities 147,709 (1,200) 147,709 (1,200) $ 254,429 $ (2,466) $ 3,270 $ (21) $ 257,699 $ (2,487) The securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an otherthantemporarily impaired investment. These securities have an investment grade credit rating. The current unrealized loss is the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. These investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value. Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as shortterm investments and generally consist of corporate bonds, U.S. treasury notes and commercial paper. Longterm investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities. 25 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test. We use three approaches to identifying the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets: a market approach, a market capitalization approach and an income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. All three approaches are reviewed together for consistency and commonality. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets. New Accounting Standards In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure as an amendment to FASB statement No. 123, Accounting for StockBased Compensation. This statement provides alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires prominent disclosure in our footnotes to the financial statements of our interim and annual reports. Unless the accounting rules change, we currently do not expect to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation, and, accordingly, this statement did not affect our financial position or results of operations. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement addresses the financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring), and nullifies EITF Issue No. 8810, Cost Associated with Lease Modification or Termination. SFAS No. 146 requires a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized and measured at fair value only when the liability is incurred. This statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, the FASB issued two standards related to business combinations. The first statement, SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method and prohibits the poolingofinterest method of accounting. SFAS No. 141 also states that acquired intangible assets should be separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, non compete agreements, customer lists and licenses. We were not significantly affected by the implementation of this statement. The second statement, SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires companies to cease amortization of goodwill. Rather, goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased test. Impairment charges may result in future writedowns in the period in which the impairment took place. As required, we adopted SFAS No. 142 for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002, and, accordingly, goodwill was not amortized during 2002 nor 2003. Refer to Note C of our consolidated financial statements for more information. In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133. Accordingly, a transition gain of $0.9 million, net of tax, was recorded in the first quarter of 2001 related to one financial investment classified as derivative in nature. The adjustment was shown separately as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Acquisitions During the three years ended December 31, 2003, we completed several business combinations and membership purchases. These business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Prior to December 31, 2001, goodwill was amortized over a useful life of 35 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002, we no longer amortize goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of five to twenty years. 26 Table of Contents The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2003. The purchase price, in thousands, of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and transition costs. Transition costs are initial estimates of future expenses based on historical experience and known costs. These estimates may be adjusted as actual expenses are incurred, thereby affecting the final purchase price of the acquisition. In addition, most of our acquisition agreements contain a provision for a final retroactive balance sheet settlement which may result in adjustments to the purchase price. The purchase price shown for recent acquisitions, in thousands, is inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transaction cost adjustments.

December 31, Percent 2003 2002 Change Risk membership: Commercial 1,510,000 1,283,000 17.7% Medicare 65,000 82,000 (20.7%) Medicaid 324,000 275,000 17.8% Total risk membership 1,899,000 1,640,000 15.8% Non risk membership 484,000 395,000 22.5% Total membership 2,383,000 2,035,000 17.1% Network rental membership 678,000 788,000 (14.0%) This increase in commercial risk membership is attributable to the acquisitions of Altius in the third quarter of 2003 and PersonalCare in the first quarter of 2003, as well as continued organic growth. Medicare membership decreased as a result of the termination of the Mid America Medicare Risk contract as of January 1, 2003. Medicaid membership increased primarily as a result of an auto assignment of additional members by the State of Missouri due to the withdrawal of a competitor in that market. Nonrisk membership increased as a result of the Altius acquisition and from additional organic membership obtained in our Missouri market. Overall organic membership growth, which excludes initial acquisitions and all changes to acquired entities during the first twelve months of operations, was approximately 7.7% and 2.8% for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table (in thousands, except percentages and membership data) is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. On December 23, 2003, our Board of Directors approved a threefortwo stock split of our common stock, effective January 30, 2004 for stockholders of record on January 9, 2004. The stock split is reflected retroactively in per share data for all periods presented. 2003 2002 Increase(Decrease) 2002 2001 Increase(Decrease) Operating revenues: Managed care premiums $4,442,445 $3,504,215 $ 938,230 $3,504,215 $3,082,825 $ 421,390 Management services 92,698 72,690 20,008 72,690 64,420 8,270 Total operating revenues $4,535,143 $3,576,905 $ 958,238 $3,576,905 $3,147,245 $ 429,660 Operating expenses: Medical costs $3,607,289 $2,919,499 $ 687,790 $2,919,499 $2,650,993 $ 268,506 Selling, general and administrative 543,478 437,851 105,627 437,851 379,234 58,617 Depreciation and amortization 18,179 18,885 (706) 18,885 25,910 (7,025) Total operating expenses $4,168,946 $3,376,235 $ 792,711 $3,376,235 $3,056,137 $ 320,098 Operating earnings 366,197 200,670 165,527 200,670 91,108 109,562 Net earnings $ 250,145 $ 145,603 $ 104,542 $ 145,603 $ 84,407 $ 61,196 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.75 $ 1.58 $ 1.17 $ 1.58 $ 0.83 $ 0.75 Medical loss ratios: Commercial 79.9% 82.8% (2.9%) 82.8% 85.9% (3.1%) Medicare 83.8% 85.9% (2.1%) 85.9% 89.4% (3.5%) Medicaid 87.5% 84.0% 3.5% 84.0% 83.5% 0.5% Total 81.2% 83.3% (2.1%) 83.3% 86.0% (2.7%) Administrative statistics: Selling, general and administrative 12.0% 12.2% (0.2%) 12.2% 12.0% 0.2% Days in medical claims liabilities 51.01 59.46 (8.45) 59.46 61.98 (2.52) Days in other medical liabilities 5.68 7.33 (1.65) 7.33 8.39 (1.06) Membership at December 31: Commercial 1,510,000 1,283,000 227,000 1,283,000 1,211,000 72,000 Medicare 65,000 82,000 (17,000) 82,000 53,000 29,000 Medicaid 324,000 275,000 49,000 275,000 258,000 17,000 Non risk 484,000 395,000 89,000 395,000 319,000 76,000 Total Membership 2,383,000 2,035,000 348,000 2,035,000 1,841,000 194,000 Network rental membership 678,000 788,000 (110,000) 788,000 730,000 58,000 28 Table of Contents Comparison of 2003 to 2002 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of rate increases on renewals that occurred throughout all markets, acquisitions and organic membership growth. Rate increases on commercial risk renewals averaged 13.5% for the year 2003. Commercial yields increased by an average of 12.1% on a per member per month (PMPM) basis. Excluding the Altius acquisition, the commercial yield increased 12.8%. Medicare yields increased 6.1% on a PMPM basis as a result of changes being made to rate structures, as well as changes in demographics. The acquisitions of Mid America, PersonalCare, and Altius resulted in an increase in managed care premium revenue of approximately $325 million. Organic membership growth resulted in an increase to managed care premiums of approximately $265 million. Management services revenue increased due to the increase in nonrisk membership discussed earlier. Medical costs have increased due to acquisitions, organic growth and medical trend. Our total medical loss ratio (medical costs as a percentage of managed care premiums) for all products improved 2.1%. This favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend. Reported commercial medical trends, net of benefit buy downs, have been below 10% for each of the last two years. Our Medicare business medical loss ratio improved as a result of an increase in premium yields discussed above and exiting three counties in the Kansas City market on January 1, 2003. Our Medicaid medical loss ratio increased as a result of changes in the geographical markets in which we operate, and an increase in membership in a capitated service. We exited the Delaware Medicaid market on July 1, 2002. Within our Pennsylvania market, membership in our capitated Medicaid behavioral health program has increased significantly during 2002 and 2003. This program has a high medical loss ratio, but is lower in risk to our Company. Our days in total medical claims liabilities have decreased 10.1 days from prior year due to faster claim receipts and processing cycle times as well as efforts to reduce claim inventories. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased costs associated with acquisitions, an increase in broker commissions and an increase in salary expenses. Broker commissions, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to the growth in both organic membership and in premium yields. Salary expenses, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to annual salary increases, additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in 2003, additional management and sales incentive accruals and incremental salary expense related to our organic membership growth. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expense decreased by 0.2%. Senior notes interest and amortization expense has increased in 2003. Due to the issuance of the notes on February 1, 2002, the prior year period represented eleven months of interest compared to twelve months in 2003. Also contributing to the increase is a $0.5 million loss on the repurchase of a portion of our senior notes at a premium in the third quarter of 2003. Other income increased due to a larger investment portfolio in 2003 offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates. Additionally, the current year included a gain from our single derivative investment compared to a loss in the prior year. This derivative investment was sold during the second quarter of 2003. Our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in earnings before taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 36.4% in 2003 from 35.5% in 2002. Comparison of 2002 to 2001 Managed care premium revenue increased in 2002 over 2001 primarily from commercial rate increases that occurred throughout both years and from membership growth, both organically and through the previously discussed acquisitions. Commercial premium rates increased by an average of $20.75 over 2001 on a per member per month (PMPM) basis, to $183.80 PMPM. Management services revenue increased in 2002 from 2001 as a result of acquisitions. In particular, the Health Partners, Blue Ridge, NewAlliance and MidAmerica acquisitions accounted for approximately 113,800 new non risk members. Medical costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to membership growth, as discussed above and medical trend. Our commercial medical trend for the year ended 2002 was 8.6% and the average trend for the three year period ended December 31, 2002 was 10.1%. Our medical loss ratio improved in 2002 in our Commercial and Medicare product lines as a result of rate increases outpacing medical trends. 29 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased in 2002 primarily due to acquisitions, an increase in fees paid to brokers and incremental salary expense related to the expansion of our customer service organization. During 2002, we opened a new regional service center in Bismarck, North Dakota to perform customer service functions related to the MidAmerica acquisition and to create additional capacity for future acquisitions. As a percentage of revenue, selling general and administrative expense increased slightly by 0.2% to 12.2% for 2002. Depreciation and amortization decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in January 2002. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill but rather test for impairment at least once a year. In 2001, we amortized $7.5 million in goodwill. We did not incur any impairment charges during 2002. Senior notes interest and amortization expense were incurred in 2002 due to the issuance of our senior notes on February 1, 2002, as described below in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Other income, net decreased in 2002 from 2001 due primarily to the change in valuation of a derivative investment. We recorded a gain in 2001 and a loss in 2002 related to this derivative. The decrease is also related to a decrease in the amortization of discounts on investments, offset by an increase in interest income due to cash placed in long term investments to achieve higher yields. Our provision for income taxes increased in 2002 due to an increase in operating earnings, offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate from 38.0% in 2001 to 35.5% in 2002. This decrease in the tax rate is the result of strategic tax planning and due to the elimination of goodwill amortization in 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated Our total cash and investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments, but excluding deposits of $23.2 million restricted under state regulations, increased $283.1 million to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2003 from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2002. Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased over the prior year due to an increase in net earnings, a decrease in other receivables and an increase in deferred revenue. These are offset by an increase in the longterm deferred tax asset. Other receivables have decreased due to accelerated collections of our pharmacy rebate receivables as a result of improved procedures implemented in 2003. Deferred revenue has increased due to accelerated collections of premium billings as a result of operational efficiencies experienced at our regional service centers. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 improved over the prior year primarily as a result of investment activity, offset by an increased amount of payments for acquisitions. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2003 were only slightly above that of the prior year. Projected capital investments in 2004 of approximately $16 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. Net cash from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 improved over the prior year as result of fewer repurchases of our common stock in 2003. On February 1, 2002, we completed the purchase of 7.1 million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable, at that time, for 3.1 million shares of our common stock, owned by Principal Health Care, Inc. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and the warrant was $176.1 million. The purchase of the shares and warrant from Principal ended their ownership of our common stock. We financed the stock and warrant repurchase with the proceeds from the sale of $175.0 million of our 8.125% senior notes due February 15, 2012. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 each year. As required under the terms of the senior notes, we made interest payments of $14.2 million and $7.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition to the repurchase of our common stock from Principal we made repurchases or our common stock, as described below in Share Repurchase Program, at an aggregate cost of $65.5 million. In August 2003, we repurchased a portion of our senior notes with a face value of $4.5 million and a weighted average premium of 8.9%. The senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and restricting transactions with affiliates, sales of assets and consolidations or mergers. We have complied with all covenants under the senior notes. 30 Table of Contents Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 increased over 2001 due to an increase in net earnings and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. The latter was a result of increases in additional selling, general and administrative liabilities related to our acquisitions and business growth throughout 2001 and 2002 and an increase in our deferred tax liability. These increases were offset by a decrease in total medical claims liabilities as a result of the timing of medical claims payments. Also, in 2001 we received 13 months worth of Medicare premium payments as a result of the timing of CMS payments and only 12 months of premium payments were received during 2002 which led to the decrease in our deferred revenue. Our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk of principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA+ and an average contractual duration of 3.1 years, as of December 31, 2003. We will continue to fund our working capital requirements from our cash flow from operations. We believe that because our longterm investments are availableforsale, the amount of such investments should be considered when assessing our liquidity. On such basis, current assets plus longterm investments availableforsale less current liabilities increased to $730.5 million at December 31, 2003 from $498.0 million at December 31, 2002. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its regulated entities. During 2003, we collected $108.7 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that, if adopted, generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital deemed appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations with consideration for its size and risk profile. This calculation, approved by the NAIC, incorporates asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk and business risk components. The Companys health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. The RBC results are used to determine if the health plans statutory net worth is adequate to support the amount of its calculated risk profile. Regulators also use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted an RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. We have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above 250% of their RBC. Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate, require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 (in millions except percentage data). 2003 2002 Capital and surplus $ 588.6 $ 437.1 250% of RBC 374.5 315.9 Excess capital and surplus above 250% of RBC 214.1 121.2 Capital and surplus as a percentage of RBC 393% 346% Statutory deposits 23.2 19.5 The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of income from 2003 and the acquisitions of PersonalCare and Altius, offset by dividends paid to the parent company. The increase in statutory deposits is mainly a result of the acquisitions of PersonalCare and Altius. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation, we had cash and investments of approximately $209.5 million and $86.7 million at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively. The increase in nonregulated cash and investments is primarily a result of dividends received from subsidiaries mentioned above and ordinary operating activities offset by payments for acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we made capital contributions of approximately $14.1 million to our HMO subsidiaries. This contribution was almost exclusively made to our recently acquired Altius Health Plan in order to increase capital and surplus to appropriate levels. 31 Table of Contents Other The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules, as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which, among other things, impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data, including a members transactions with health care providers and payors, as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers. We have spent approximately $4.2 million, $4.1 million and $0.9 million on compliance matters for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We anticipate spending approximately $2.6 million in 2004, of which approximately $1.0 million will be capitalized, related to improved functionality of our electronic transaction code sets, improved provider identifier standards, and improved security and patient information privacy standards. As of December 31, 2003, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 years Senior notes $ 170,500 $ $ $ $ 170,500 Interest payable on Senior notes 117,751 13,853 27,706 27,706 48,486 Operating leases 84,546 16,560 28,775 18,559 20,652 Total contractual obligations 372,797 30,413 56,481 46,265 239,638 Less sublease income (10,506) (1,439) (2,351) (2,050) (4,666) Net contractual obligations $ 362,291 $ 28,974 $ 54,130 $ 44,215 $ 234,972 Refer to Note I to our consolidated financial statement for disclosure related to our operating leases. The nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. The demand for our products and services are subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. Please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in this Form 10K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. Other Disclosures Share Repurchase Program Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase up to 10% of our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, we purchased 5.6 million shares of our common stock from 1999 to 2002, which includes 3.3 million purchased in 2002 at an aggregate cost of $65.5 million. We did not purchase any shares of our common stock in 2003 under this program. Between January 1, 2004, and the date of this filing, under the share repurchase program previously approved by the Board of Directors, the Company purchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $84.6 million. The remaining common shares the Company is authorized to repurchase under the program is approximately 1.8 million. Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the Company, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2003 may result in the assertion of additional claims. We maintain general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary. 32 Table of Contents Our captive subsidiary provides up to $5 million in professional liability coverage for each single claim and up to $10 million in coverage for each class action claim. The captive professional liability policy has an aggregate limit of $20 million per year. The captive is also coinsured with a commercial carrier for an additional $10 million for professional liability claims. Additionally, the captive employment practices liability policy provides up to $250,000 per single claim, $10 million per class action claim, and an aggregate policy limit of $10 million. Each year we will re evaluate the most cost effective method for insuring these types of claims. We are a defendant in the provider track in the Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, MDL No. 1334, styled in re: Humana, Inc., Charles B. Shane, MD, et al. vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This action was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against us and twelve other companies in the managed care industry. In its fourth amended complaint, the plaintiffs have alleged violations of RICO, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these RICO claims, the complaint includes counts for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. We have filed a motion to dismiss each of these claims because they fail to state a cause of action or, in the alternative, to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions which exist in our physician contracts. In response to the motion to dismiss, the trial court dismissed several of the claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration provision in their provider contracts must submit all of their claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, all the plaintiffs who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their arbitratable claims. The trial court excluded from the scope of claims subject to arbitration, the plaintiffs claims of conspiracy, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting violations of RICO. The defendants, including the Company, have appealed the trial courts decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal has been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting a date for oral argument. The trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians; however, we are not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant. The plaintiffs have now filed a motion to certify a class as to the Company, and we have filed our opposition to that motion. The trial court has not yet issued a ruling on the motion. The defendants who were subject to the certification order filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit which has been argued. The appeals court has not yet issued its decision. Subsequent to this appeal, two companies have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs. Both settlement agreements have been filed with the Court and have received final approval. Although we can not predict the outcome, management believes that this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit, and we intend to defend our position. We may be the target of other similar lawsuits involving RICO and ERISA, generally claiming that managed care companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health care. Although we may be the target of other similar lawsuits, we believe there is no valid basis for such lawsuits. Our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Existing or future laws could have a significant effect on our operations. Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the shortterm. Our industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change. Existing or future laws could have significant effect on our operations. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 33 Table of Contents 2004 Outlook As a result of a strong sales force, a broad product offering, a disciplined underwriting process and superior customer service, we have an organic membership growth target of 3 5% for the year 2004. We operate in highly competitive markets, but believe that the pricing environment is rational in our existing markets, thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases. We will continue to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in 2004. Management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products. In 2004, we have received Medicare rate increases of 10.7%, which was 5.7% from the original Adjusted Community Rating filings and 5% additional as a result of the Medicare Modernization Act passed in December 2003. The rate increases will not improve our profitability as the increases are for enhanced member benefits and or network access. We currently anticipate reducing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2004, excluding the effect of any future acquisitions, through medical claims autoadjudication, improved customer service, ecommerce initiatives, spending controls and fixed costs leverage. Management believes that the foregoing should result in earnings improvements in 2004, although realization is dependent upon a variety of factors, some of which may be outside of our control. Risk Factors The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Further, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. Most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services. As a result, our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. We base the premiums we charge, at least in part, on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period. Factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include: an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals; higher than expected utilization of health care services; periodic renegotiations of hospital, physician and other provider contracts; the occurrence of epidemics and catastrophic events; changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them; general inflation or economic downturns; new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs; and other unforeseen occurrences. In addition, medical claims payable in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and unpaid claims, which we call IBNR. The estimates for submitted claims and IBNR are made on an accrual basis. We believe that our reserves for IBNR are adequate to satisfy our medical claims liabilities, but we can not assure you of this. Any adjustments to our IBNR reserves could adversely affect our results of operations. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs, we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition, government regulations and other factors. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase. 34 Table of Contents A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include: reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage; reductions in work force by existing customers; increases in premiums or benefit changes; benefit changes or reductions in premiums by our competitors; our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan; and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally. Our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to acquire additional health plans and successfully integrate those plans into our operations. Part of our growth strategy is to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans. During the last several years, we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions. We can not assure you that we will be able to continue to locate suitable acquisition candidates, successfully integrate the plans we acquire and realize anticipated operational improvements and cost savings. The plans we acquire also may not achieve our anticipated levels of profitability. Our future growth rate will be adversely affected if we are not able to successfully complete acquisitions. Competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates. We compete with other health plans for members. We believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are: price of benefits offered; location and choice of health care providers; quality of customer service; comprehensiveness of coverage offered; reputation for quality care; financial stability of the plan; and diversity of product offerings. We face competition from other managed care companies, hospitals, health care facilities and other health care providers that may have broader geographical coverage, more established reputations in our markets, greater market share, lower costs and greater financial and other resources. We also may theoretically face increased rate competition from certain notforprofit health insurance organizations that would potentially be required by state regulation to reduce capital surpluses that have been excessive. We depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers, and we can not assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future. We depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services, particularly to small employer group members. We do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers and they typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers, and we can not assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products in a fair and consistent manner. Our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership. Our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs. In addition, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets. 35 Table of Contents In some of our markets, there are large provider systems that have a major presence. Some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future. These provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us, place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us. Provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiations. We can not assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us. Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations. Over the last several years, the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, such as the Patients Bill of Rights legislation in 2001, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by: requiring us to change our products and services; increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate; or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services. Negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members. A failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business. We depend on our information systems for timely and accurate information. Failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or disruptions in our information systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, disputes with customers and providers, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences. Compliance with privacy laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The use of patient data by all of our businesses is regulated at the federal, state and local level. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, for example, imposed significant new requirements relating to maintaining the privacy of medical information. Various agencies of the federal government have issued regulations to implement certain sections of this Act. The law is farreaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continues to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with the law are ongoing. Because these regulations and other similar federal, state and local laws and regulations continue to evolve, we can not guarantee that the costs of compliance will not adversely affect our results of operations or cause us to change our operations significantly. We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is heavily regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that: impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions; limit premium levels; increase minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly; impose fines or other penalties as a result of market conduct reviews; prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks; prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits; limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider; limit contractual terms with providers, including audit, payment and termination provisions; and implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials. 36 Table of Contents In addition, we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations. Federal, state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business. We can not predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We face periodic reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business. We contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in: refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts; imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions on us; loss of our right to participate in various federal programs; damage to our reputation in various markets; increased difficulty in selling our products and services; and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or HMO or to otherwise provide a service. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories, that could significantly affect our results of operations. Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to: our denial of non covered benefits; vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims; disputes with our providers over alleged violations of RICO; disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to our non risk business, including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties, claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements; disputes over our co payment calculations; customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations; and disputes over payments for out of network benefits. In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of purported legal claims against managed care companies. Recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims. In some cases, plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic, non economic or punitive damages. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In the event that a significant damage award does occur it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We can not determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular. We have, and expect to maintain, liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur. Currently, the professional liability and employment practices liability insurance is covered through our captive subsidiary. Potential liabilities that we incur may not, however, be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage, our insurers may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate. We can not assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis, if at all. 37 Table of Contents Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile. From time to time, the price and trading volume of our common stock, as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility. Companyspecific issues and developments generally in the health care industry (including the regulatory environment) and the capital markets may cause this volatility. Our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: quarterly variations in our operating results; changes in the markets expectations about our future operating results; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; news reports relating to trends in our markets; changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business; acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry; and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur. Our indebtedness will impose restrictions on our business and operations. The indenture for our senior notes, which were issued on February 1, 2002, imposes restrictions on our business and operations. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; create or permit certain liens on our assets; sell assets; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which may impose further restrictions on us. The restrictions in the indenture for our senior notes and in any future debt instruments could limit, among other things, our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities. We may not be able to satisfy our obligations to holders of the senior notes upon a change of control. In the event of a change of control of our company, we will be required, subject to certain conditions, to offer to purchase all of our outstanding senior notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of purchase. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of the senior notes or that restrictions in any other debt instruments may not allow such repurchases. Our failure to purchase the senior notes would be a default under the indenture governing the senior notes. 38 Table of Contents Even if we are able to repurchase the senior notes in the event of a change of control, the use of our cash resources to complete the repurchase may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable. We have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may delay, discourage or prevent a merger, acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions: authorize us to issue preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders; provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting; provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares; provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting. These provisions of our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Effects of terrorism There can be no assurance that the war on terrorism, the threat of future acts of terrorism or the related concerns of members or providers will not adversely affect our health care costs and our ability to predict and control such costs. Future acts of terrorism and bio terrorism could adversely affect us through, among other things: increased utilization of health care services including, without limitation, hospital and physician services, ancillary testing and procedures, vaccinations, prescriptions for drugs, mental health services and other services; loss of membership as the result of lay offs or other in force reductions of employment; adverse effects upon the financial condition or business of employers who sponsor health care coverage for their employees; disruption of our business or operations; and disruption of the financial and insurance markets in general. General economic conditions Changes in economic conditions could affect our business and results of operations. The state of the economy could affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums. The state of the economy has also affected the states budgets, which could result in the states attempting to reduce payments to Medicaid plans in those states in which we offer Medicaid plans, and increase taxes and assessments on our activities. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs resulting from any budget cuts in states in which we operate. Although we have attempted to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of our membership, there can be no assurance that the effects of economic conditions will not cause our existing membership to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or will not result in significant membership loss, lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership. 39 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. The investment policy specifically prohibits investments in any equities or in fixed income securities that are below investment grade. We have classified all of our investments as availableforsale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Administration and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as availableforsale. Investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are otherthantemporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. See Note E to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. Our investments at December 31, 2003 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): AmortizedCost FairValue As of December 31, 2003 Maturities: Within 1 year $ 234,553 $ 236,036 1 to 5 years 554,629 570,671 5 to 10 years 312,224 323,040 Over 10 years 22,111 22,844 Total shortterm and longterm securities $1,123,517 $1,152,591 40 Table of Contents Our projections of hypothetical net losses in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
