Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows. Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Risk Factors Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a leading publicly traded managed health care company with approximately 2.5 million members as of December 31, 2004. We operate a diversified portfolio of local market health plans, insurance companies and provider networks serving 15 markets. Our operations are based in Bethesda, Maryland with our local markets primarily covering the Mid Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States. Our primary focus has been owning and operating health plans with a concentration on risk business with mid sized employer groups. On January 28, 2005, we acquired First Health which operates one of the largest national preferred provider organization networks. First Health is a major national provider of non risk administrative and medical management services to commercial, governmental and third party payor customers. Since the acquisition was consummated in 2005, First Healths financial position and operating results are not included in this discussion. We believe the combination of Coventry and First Health creates a leading health benefits company with the size, scale and product breadth to be a market leader with significant growth opportunities. First Healths strengths and business mix are highly complementary to our existing business, enabling the following benefits, among others: significantly expands our geographic presence, creating a national healthcare platform with substantial growth opportunities; diversifies our product offerings and client base and enables us to serve a full spectrum of healthcare clients nationwide, ranging from national accounts to small businesses and including corporate, federal government, state government, Medicaid and Medicare clients; significantly increases our fee based, non regulated cash flows; and leverages our existing operating expertise and administrative infrastructure. Highlights of 2004 Performance Membership increased 5% over the prior year. Revenue increased 17% over the prior year. Medical loss ratio of 80.5% improved 70 basis points over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 11.5% of operating revenue, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year. Operating margin of 9.4% improved 130 basis points over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 35% over the prior year. Cash flows from operations was $453.9 million, a 41% improvement over the prior year. Total cash and investments was $1.7 billion, a 23% increase over the prior year. 18 Table of Contents Operating Revenue and Products We generate our operating revenues from premiums for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our preferred provider organization (PPO) and point of service (POS) products are typically lower than our health maintenance organization (HMO) premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee for access to our provider networks and management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include network management, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. In addition, we rent our network of providers, including claims repricing and utilization review, to other managed care plans or non risk employers and assume no underwriting risk. During the three years ended December 31, 2004, we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due in part to membership increases from acquisitions. Acquisitions must have a manageable regulatory and business climate and have the ability to add value to our company. Additionally, membership growth was achieved organically through marketing efforts, geographic expansion and increased product offerings. Our ability to introduce products quickly to each market has helped us to expand our customer base. In particular, we have been able to add a large variety of lower cost products, which has proven especially attractive to customers. Operating Expenses Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Our health plans maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated through a national network of pharmacies at discounted rates. We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services, such as mental health care, and a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation arrangements. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in providing appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of cost effective, medically appropriate services. We operate four regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions for our health plans. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices at each of our plans and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. We centralize the underwriting and product pricing functions for our health plans, which allows us to utilize our underwriting expertise and a disciplined pricing strategy at each of our health plans. 19 Table of Contents Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have not needed to use financing methods to fund operations. We have a low debt to capital ratio and while we did issue senior notes in 2002 (as described in Note H to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K), the entire proceeds were used to repurchase a portion of our common stock and were not used to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions and for repurchases of our common stock. In late January 2005, in connection with the First Health merger, we incurred approximately $865 million of indebtedness in order to finance the acquisition of all of First Healths outstanding common stock, refinance the existing indebtedness of First Health and pay related transaction fees and expenses. We do not anticipate that any of the proceeds of such indebtedness will be used to fund operations. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $6.7 million compared with approximately $7.2 million at December 31, 2003. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.9 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for the older receivables. The allowances have declined as a result of an improvement in the aging of our premium receivables. We also receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. We contract with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide managed health care services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts with the OPM and applicable government regulations establish premium rating arrangements for this program. The OPM conducts periodic audits of its contractors to, among other things, verify that the premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with the community rating and other requirements under FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. We periodically reconcile our contracts with the OPM and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. We record reserves, on an estimated basis annually, based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone on hold time, etc. Under these performance guarantees, we could be at risk and may incur penalties for not maintaining the standards established in the contracts. The risk level varies by agreement with penalties based on a variety of calculations including per member per month, percentage of premium, or percentage of administration fees. Risk levels are evaluated at least quarterly. We estimate our potential exposure and record appropriate reserves. The penalties that we have incurred have been immaterial and, although, we can not predict with precision the future effect on our results of operations of these penalties, we expect them to remain immaterial. 20 Table of Contents Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization, and other factors. Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2004 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase(Decrease) inCompletionFactor (Decrease)Increase inUnpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease)Increase inClaims TrendFactor (Decrease)Increase inUnpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease)Increase inInpatient DayFactor (Decrease)Increase inUnpaid Claims Liabilities 3.0% $ (14,974) (5.0)% $ (45,748) (5.0)% $ (8,759) 2.0% $ (10,094) (2.5)% $ (22,874) (2.5)% $ (4,380) 1.0% $ (5,104) (1.0)% $ (9,150) (1.0)% $ (1,752) (1.0)% $ 5,222 1.0% $ 9,150 1.0% $ 1,752 (2.0)% $ 10,567 2.5% $ 22,874 2.5% $ 4,380 (3.0)% $ 16,038 5.0% $ 45,748 5.0% $ 8,759 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. Accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. Certain situations require judgment in setting reserves, such as system conversions, processing interruptions, environmental changes or other factors. 21 Table of Contents Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarial developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we have experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively (in thousands). 2004 2003 2002 Medical liabilities, beginning of period $ 597,190 $ 558,599 $ 522,854 Acquisitions 38,828 30,778 Reported Medical Costs Current year 4,257,942 3,693,821 2,985,472 Prior year (72,047) (86,532) (65,973) Total reported medical costs $ 4,185,895 $ 3,607,289 $ 2,919,499 Claim Payments Payments for current year 3,691,092 3,235,902 2,527,999 Payments for prior year 431,518 371,624 386,533 Total claim payments $ 4,122,610 $ 3,607,526 $ 2,914,532 Medical liabilities, end of period $ 660,475 $ 597,190 $ 558,599 Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. Subsequent changes in estimates related to the acquired balances are recorded as adjustments to the settlement account with the acquired entitys previous owner. The negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2004 prior year medical costs relate almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2003. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2004; however, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. 22 Table of Contents Investments We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The following table shows our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value, at December 31, 2004, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss State and municipal bonds $ 57,504 $ (506) $ 11,437 $ (272) $ 68,941 $ (778) US Treasury & agency securities 96,340 (392) 96,340 (392) Mortgage backed securities 57,306 (357) 3,766 (61) 61,072 (418) Asset backed securities 21,786 (226) 1,912 (88) 23,698 (314) Corporate debt and other securities 264,939 (1,583) 21,184 (708) 286,123 (2,291) $ 497,875 $ (3,064) $ 38,299 $ (1,129) $ 536,174 $ (4,193) The securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporarily impaired investment. These securities have an investment grade credit rating. The current unrealized loss is the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. These investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value. Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds, U.S. treasury notes and commercial paper. Long term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities. 23 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We use three approaches to identifying the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets: a market approach, a market capitalization approach and an income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. All three approaches are reviewed together for consistency and commonality. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment took place as recalculated on October 1, our annual impairment test date. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite intangibles. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) on July 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, have recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method will have an effect on our results of operations, although it will have no material effect on our overall financial position. The effect of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) in prior periods using the Black Scholes method of valuation, the effect of that standard would have approximated the effect of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note A to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (as it is dependent upon, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows that would have been recognized under SFAS No. 123 in 2004, 2003 and 2002 for such excess tax benefits were $15.8 million, $15.6 million, and $12.9 million, respectively. Acquisitions During the three years ended December 31, 2004, we completed several business combinations and membership purchases. These business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to twenty years. 24 Table of Contents The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2004. The purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The estimated transition costs may be adjusted as actual expenses are incurred, thereby affecting the final purchase price of the acquisition. In addition, most of our acquisition agreements contain a provision for a final retroactive balance sheet settlement which may result in adjustments to the purchase price. The purchase price shown for recent acquisitions, in thousands, is inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transaction cost adjustments.

December 31, Percent 2004 2003 Change Risk membership: Commercial 1,483 1,510 (1.8%) Medicare 69 65 6.2% Medicaid 397 324 22.5% Total risk membership 1,949 1,899 2.6% Non risk membership 560 484 15.7% Total membership 2,509 2,383 5.3% Medicaid membership increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of OmniCare in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in non risk membership was influenced by three large groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product effective January 1, 2004, as well as from additional organic membership obtained in the Missouri market. In January 2005, we lost a large commercial insured account to an administrative services only (ASO) bid and a large existing ASO account to another third party administrator. Because of the loss of this membership, organic growth was negative in January but currently is expected to be one to three percent for all of 2005. 25 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. 2004 2003 Increase (Decrease) 2003 2002 Increase (Decrease) Summary Results (in thousands, except EPS) Total operating revenues $ 5,311,969 $ 4,535,143 17.1% $ 4,535,143 $ 3,576,905 26.8% Operating earnings $ 496,671 $ 366,197 35.6% $ 366,197 $ 200,670 82.5% Net earnings $ 337,117 $ 250,145 34.8% $ 250,145 $ 145,603 71.8% Diluted earnings per share $ 3.72 $ 2.75 35.3% $ 2.75 $ 1.58 74.1% Managed Care Premium Yields (per member per month): Commercial $ 226.59 $ 206.08 10.0% $ 206.08 $ 183.78 12.1% Medicare $ 695.96 $ 629.52 10.6% $ 629.52 $ 593.29 6.1% Medicaid $ 145.23 $ 139.69 4.0% $ 139.69 $ 137.54 1.6% Medical Costs (per member per month): Commercial $ 179.22 $ 164.56 8.9% $ 164.56 $ 152.12 8.2% Medicare $ 579.92 $ 527.84 9.9% $ 527.84 $ 509.60 3.6% Medicaid $ 126.88 $ 122.25 3.8% $ 122.25 $ 115.58 5.8% Medical Loss Ratios: Commercial 79.1% 79.9% (0.8%) 79.9% 82.8% (2.9%) Medicare 83.3% 83.8% (0.5%) 83.8% 85.9% (2.1%) Medicaid 87.4% 87.5% (0.1%) 87.5% 84.0% 3.5% Total 80.5% 81.2% (0.7%) 81.2% 83.3% (2.1%) Administrative Statistics: Selling, general and administrative as a percentage of revenue 11.5% 12.0% (0.5%) 12.0% 12.2% (0.2%) Days in medical liabilities 55.8 56.7 (0.9) 56.7 66.8 (10.1) Comparison of 2004 to 2003 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets, acquisitions and organic growth. Commercial yields (premium per member per month) increased as a result of rate increases on renewals that occurred throughout all markets. Medicare yields increased as a result of the rate increases from the annual Adjusted Community Rating filings and from the Medicare Modernization Act. The rate increases from the Medicare Modernization Act were required to be used for enhanced member benefits and or network access and thus did not affect profitability. The acquisition of Altius effective September 1, 2003 and OmniCare effective October 1, 2004 accounted for $208.7 million of the increase in managed care premium revenue over the prior year. Management services revenue increased due to the increase in non risk membership discussed earlier. Medical costs have increased due to medical trend, acquisitions and organic growth. However, total medical expense as a percentage of managed care premium revenue has improved to 80.5% over the prior year. This favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend. Reported commercial medical trend, net of benefit buy downs, was 8.9%. Our Medicare business medical loss ratio improved compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in premium yields discussed above. Our overall Medicaid medical loss ratio was essentially flat compared to prior year. Excluding OmniCare, the Medicaid medical loss ratio would have improved to 86.9%. The same store improvement is as a result of rate increases across our markets and as a result of much improved performance in our Medicaid Virginia market. The Virginia market benefited from lower utilization, lower drug costs and favorable provider contract renegotiations. 26 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to normal operating costs of recent acquisitions, an increase in broker commissions and an increase in salary expenses. Broker commissions, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to the growth in both organic membership and in premium rates. Salary expenses, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to annual compensation increases, additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in 2003 and 2004, and incremental compensation expense related to our organic membership growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of continuing revenue growth and success in controlling customer service costs. Other income increased due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates and as a result of a larger investment portfolio in 2004. Additionally, 2003 other income included a gain from sale of our single derivative investment which partially offsets the current year increase. Our provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in earnings before taxes. The effective tax rate decreased to 36.0% in 2004 from 36.4% in 2003. Days in total medical claims liabilities decreased from the prior year due primarily to faster claim receipts and continually improved processing cycle times. Comparison of 2003 to 2002 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of rate increases on renewals that occurred throughout all markets, acquisitions and organic membership growth. Rate increases on commercial risk renewals averaged 13.5% for the year 2003. Commercial yields increased by an average of 12.1% on a per member per month (PMPM) basis. Excluding the Altius acquisition, the commercial yield increased 12.8%. Medicare yields increased as a result of changes being made to rate structures, as well as changes in demographics. The acquisitions of Mid America, PersonalCare, and Altius resulted in an increase in managed care premium revenue of approximately $325 million. Organic membership growth resulted in an increase to managed care premiums of approximately $265 million. Management services revenue increased due to the increase in non risk membership discussed earlier. Medical costs have increased due to acquisitions, organic growth and medical trend. Our total medical costs as a percentage of managed care premiums for all products improved 2.1%. This favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend. Reported commercial medical trends, net of benefit buy downs, have been below 10% for each of the last two years. Our Medicare business medical loss ratio improved as a result of an increase in premium yields discussed above and exiting three counties in the Kansas City market on January 1, 2003. Our Medicaid medical loss ratio increased as a result of changes in the geographical markets in which we operate, and an increase in membership in a capitated service. We exited the Delaware Medicaid market on July 1, 2002. Within our Pennsylvania market, membership in our capitated Medicaid behavioral health program has increased significantly during 2002 and 2003. This program has a high medical loss ratio, but is lower in risk to our Company. Our days in total medical claims liabilities have decreased 10.1 days from prior year due to faster claim receipts and processing cycle times as well as efforts to reduce claim inventories. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased costs associated with acquisitions, an increase in broker commissions and an increase in salary expenses. Broker commissions, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to the growth in both organic membership and in premium yields. Salary expenses, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to annual salary increases, additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in 2003, additional management and sales incentive accruals and incremental salary expense related to our organic membership growth. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expense decreased by 0.2%. Senior notes interest and amortization expense has increased in 2003. Due to the issuance of the notes on February 1, 2002, the prior year period represented eleven months of interest compared to twelve months in 2003. Also contributing to the increase is a $0.5 million loss on the repurchase of a portion of our senior notes at a premium in the third quarter of 2003. Other income increased due to a larger investment portfolio in 2003 offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates. Additionally, the current year included a gain from our single derivative investment compared to a loss in the prior year. This derivative investment was sold during the second quarter of 2003. Our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in earnings before taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 36.4% in 2003 from 35.5% in 2002. 27 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 30 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. In addition to ample current liquidity, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs. Our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA and an average contractual duration of 2.5 years, as of December 31, 2004. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities, and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. Our total cash and investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $23.1 million restricted under state regulations, increased $321.8 million to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2004 from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2003. We will continue to fund our working capital requirements from our cash flow from operations. We believe that because our long term investments are available for sale, the amount of such investments should be considered when assessing our liquidity. On such basis, current assets plus long term investments available for sale less current liabilities increased to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2004 from $730.5 million at December 31, 2003. The demand for our products and services are subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. Please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. Cash Flows Net cash from operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2004, operating cash flow was positively affected by an increase in medical claims liabilities and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities. Medical liabilities were unusually low at December 31, 2003 due to an effort to pay down medical claims inventory at year end. The medical liabilities increased in 2004 as claim inventory levels returned to more normal levels and due to medical liabilities recorded for the new members brought on with the OmniCare membership purchase in October of 2004. Accounts payable and other liabilities increased as a result of an increase in taxes payable and an increase in the deferred compensation liability. Offsetting these operating cash inflows was a decrease in deferred revenue. As a result of the timing of CMS payments for Medicare beneficiaries, we only received eleven monthly CMS payments in 2004 versus twelve monthly CMS payments in 2003. Partially offsetting the one less CMS payment was an increase in commercial deferred revenue collections. Cash flow from operating activities has improved over the prior year as a result of higher earnings, an increase in unpaid medical liabilities and a larger increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. Offsetting these improvements was a change in deferred revenue, the reasons for which are noted above. Prior year operating cash flows included a decrease in other receivables due to accelerated collections of our pharmacy rebate receivable as a result of improved procedures implemented in 2003. The pharmacy rebate receivable remained consistent at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 and thus did not change operating cash flow year over year. Financing and Investing Activities Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase up to 10% of our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, we purchased 3.3 million shares of our common stock in 2002 at an aggregate cost of $65.5 million, no shares in 2003 and 2.0 million shares during the first quarter of 2004 at an aggregate cost of $84.6 million. As of December 31, 2004, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under the program is approximately 1.8 million. Excluded from these amounts are shares purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as these purchases are not part of the program. 28 Table of Contents On February 1, 2002 we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.125% senior notes due 2012. The proceeds from the sale were used to purchase, from Principal Health Care, Inc., 7.1 million shares of our common stock and a warrant exercisable, at that time, for 3.1 million shares of our common stock. The aggregate purchase price for the shares of common stock and warrant was $176.1 million. Interest on our senior notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 each year. The 2002 notes mature on February 15, 2012. In August 2003, we repurchased a portion of our senior notes with a face value of $4.5 million and a weighted average premium of 8.9%. We recorded a loss on the repurchase in accordance with SFAS No. 145 which requires gains and loses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations. The loss of $0.5 million was included as additional interest expense. The carrying value of our senior notes is equal to the face value and the fair value is based on the quoted market prices. As of December 31, 2004, the carrying value was $170.5 million and the fair value was $185.2 million. Our senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and restricting transactions with affiliates, sales of assets and consolidations or mergers. We have complied with all covenants under the senior notes. During January 2005, we incurred approximately $865 million of additional indebtedness related to the acquisition of First Health. The additional indebtedness includes new senior, unsecured credit facilities consisting of a $300 million five year term loan, all of which was drawn at closing, and a $150 million five year revolving credit facility, of which $65 million was drawn at closing. Loans under the new senior credit facilities bear interest at a margin or spread in excess of either (1) the one , two , three or six month rate for the Eurodollar deposits (the Eurodollar Rate) or (2) the greater of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the prime rate of the Administrative Agent (ABR), as selected by us. The margin or spread depends on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and our consolidated leverage ratio and varies from 0.75% to 2% for Eurodollar Rate loans and from 0% to 1.0% for ABR loans. Commitment fees will accrue and be payable quarterly in arrears at an initial rate of 0.375% per annum, and subsequently at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% depending on the debt ratings assigned to the new credit facilities and our consolidated leverage ratio, multiplied by the daily average undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility. The term loan has a maturity of five years and will amortize in 20 consecutive quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 10.0% of the original principal amount of the term loan during the first two years thereof, 20% of the original principal amount of the term loan during the next two years, with the balance payable in four equal installments in year five. Unless terminated earlier, the revolving credit facility terminates five years after closing and is payable in full upon its maturity on the termination date. The credit agreement contains covenants, including, among other things, covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; incur guarantee obligations; create or permit liens on assets, engage in mergers or consolidations; dispose of assets; pay dividends or other distributions, purchase or redeem our equity securities or those of our subsidiaries and make other restricted payments; make loans, advances or other investments (including acquisitions); engage in certain transactions with affiliates; agree with others to limit their ability to grant liens on assets; agree with others to limit the ability of the our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other restricted payments or to make loans or transfer assets to us or another of our subsidiaries. The new senior credit facilities also require compliance with specified financial ratios and tests, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum net worth requirement. The additional indebtedness also includes the private placement of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5 7/8% senior notes due 2012 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6 1/8% senior notes due 2015. These senior notes have since been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The senior notes are general unsecured obligations of ours and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt, including our existing 8.125% senior notes due 2012 and our new credit facilities. The indentures under which the new notes have been issued, among other things, restrict our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: make investments; incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock; create liens; incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries; and merge or consolidate with other entities. From and after the date on which the notes receive investment grade ratings from two designated rating agencies, certain covenants related to the notes will terminate. We used the proceeds from the new credit facilities and senior notes, together with approximately $221 million of cash on hand, to fund the First Health acquisition, including the repayment of First Healths outstanding bank debt and related transaction expenses. Projected cash payments for the final payment for the OmniCare purchase are $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2005. Projected capital payments in 2005 of approximately $65 million to $80 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related equipment costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. 29 Table of Contents Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2004, we received $173.6 million in dividends and $12.6 million for note repayments from our regulated subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a risk based capital (RBC) policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. We have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above 250% of their RBC and a level of 300% in aggregate (referred to below as 300% of RBC). Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 (in millions, except percentage data). Statutory Information (in millions, except percentage data) 2004 2003 Regulated capital and surplus $ 727.3 (a) $ 585.4 300% of RBC $ 515.4 (a) $ 449.4 Excess capital and surplus above 300% of RBC $ 211.9 (a) $ 136.0 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC 423% (a) 391% Statutory deposits $ 23.1 $ 23.2 (a) unaudited The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of income from 2004 offset by dividends paid to the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and multiple Department of Insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation, we had cash and investments of approximately $383.1 million and $209.5 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The increase in non regulated cash and investments is primarily a result of dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries, as mentioned above, and ordinary operating activities offset by stock repurchases made and payments for acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we made capital contributions of approximately $20.0 million to our HMO subsidiaries. Of this total, $16.0 million was made to our newly formed Michigan subsidiary to meet statutory capital requirements. 30 Table of Contents Other The United States Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules, as mandated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which, among other things, impose security and privacy requirements with respect to individually identifiable patient data, including a members transactions with health care providers and payors, as well as requirements for the standardization of certain electronic transaction code sets and provider identifiers. We have spent approximately $2.2 million, $4.2 million and $4.1 million on compliance matters for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We do not anticipate future spending related to these rules to be material. As of December 31, 2004, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 years Senior notes $ 170,500 $ $ $ $ 170,500 Interest payable on senior notes 103,898 13,853 27,706 27,706 34,633 Operating leases 72,204 15,010 25,748 17,964 13,482 Total contractual obligations 346,602 28,863 53,454 45,670 218,615 Less sublease income (9,039) (1,246) (2,094) (2,085) (3,614) Net contractual obligations $ 337,563 $ 27,617 $ 51,360 $ 43,585 $ 215,001 Refer to Note I to our consolidated financial statement for disclosure related to our operating leases. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within 6 months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within 9 months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. After giving effect to the new senior notes and new credit facilities in January 2005, we will be contractually obligated to make the following payments, in addition to the payments shown in the table above, within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period New Debt Obligations Total Less than1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than5 years New senior notes $ 500,000 $ $ $ $ 500,000 Interest payable on new senior notes 255,938 30,000 60,000 60,000 105,938 New credit facilities 365,000 30,000 90,000 245,000 Interest payable on new credit facilities (a) 53,967 14,938 25,469 13,560 Total additional contractual obligations $ 1,174,905 $ 74,938 $ 175,469 $ 318,560 $ 605,938 (a) subject to changes in the variable interest rates as discussed earlier. 31 Table of Contents Other Disclosure Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the Company, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2004 may result in the assertion of additional claims. We maintain general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary. We are a defendant in the provider track in the Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Multi District Litigation (MDL), styled In re: Managed Care Litigation, MDL No. 1334. This lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against Coventry and twelve other companies in the managed care industry. The plaintiffs have alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these federal law claims, the complaint includes state law claims for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court has dismissed several of the state law claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration provision in their provider contracts must submit their direct RICO claims and all of their remaining state law claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, all the plaintiffs who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their claims that are subject to arbitration. The trial court however has ordered that the plaintiffs claims of conspiracy, conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting violations of RICO are not subject to arbitration. The defendants appeal to the 11th Circuit challenging the trial courts arbitration decision was denied. The trial court has certified various subclasses of physicians; however, we are not subject to the class certification order because the motion to certify was filed before we were joined as a defendant. The plaintiffs have now filed a motion to certify various subclasses as to Coventry. We have filed our opposition to that motion which remains pending before the trial court. The defendants who were subject to the class certification order filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals has overturned the class certification order as to the plaintiffs state law claims but affirmed the certification with respect to the plaintiffs federal law claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has denied the defendants petition to review the 11th Circuits class certification decision. Two defendants have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs. Both settlement agreements have been filed with the Court and have received final approval. This MDL lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors, podiatrists, acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals. Each of these actions has been transferred to the MDL and has been designated as tag along actions. The court has entered an order which stays all proceedings in the tag along actions until all pre trial proceedings in the MDL action have been concluded. Although we can not predict the outcome, management believes that the MDL lawsuit and tag along actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or its results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in these lawsuits are without merit, and we intend to defend our position. Several companies in the insurance industry have received subpoenas for information from the New York Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General with respect to an industrywide investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices, including broker compensation arrangements, bid quoting practices and potential antitrust violations. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, Coventry has not been served with any such subpoenas. As a consequence of the Attorney General investigations in New York and Connecticut, Coventry, like most other companies in the insurance industry, has received Letters of Inquiry from the departments of insurance in several states in which it does business. These Letters, which are very similar, if not identical, seek information regarding broker compensation arrangements, bid quoting practices and conduct which may potentially constitute antitrust violations. Coventry has provided the information requested by these Letters and currently does not anticipate any additional follow up or requests for additional information. Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. Although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term. Nevertheless, it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations. 32 Table of Contents Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2005 Outlook Our health plans operate in highly competitive markets, but we believe that the pricing environment is rational in our existing markets, thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases. We will continue to obtain adequate premium increases and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in 2005. Management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products. In 2005, we have received Medicare premium rate increases of seven to ten percent. Additionally, we have received a Medicaid rate increase of 6.5% effective January 1, 2005 in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market. The acquisition of First Health will provide significant growth opportunities. For 2005, we will pursue achievement of synergies, the alignment business operations, accountabilities, and people toward future success, and the establishment of a foundation for future growth in each of the businesses. Risk Factors The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Further, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. Most of the premium revenue we receive is based upon rates set months before we deliver services. As a result, our results of operations largely depend on our ability to accurately estimate and control future health care costs. We base the premiums we charge, at least in part, on our estimate of expected health care costs over the applicable premium period. Factors that may cause health care costs to exceed our estimates include: an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies, including pharmaceuticals; higher than expected utilization of health care services; periodic renegotiations of hospital, physician and other provider contracts; the occurrence of epidemics and catastrophic events; changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them; general inflation or economic downturns; new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes that increase our costs; and other unforeseen occurrences. In addition, medical liabilities in our financial statements include our estimated reserves for incurred but not reported and reported but not paid claims. The estimates for medical liabilities are made on an accrual basis. We believe that our reserves for medical liabilities are adequate, but we can not assure you of this. Any adjustments to our medical liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we are unable to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Our results of operations depend on our ability to increase premiums to offset increases in our health care costs. Although we attempt to base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs, we may not be able to control the premiums we charge as a result of competition, government regulations and other factors. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to set premium rates at appropriate levels or adjust premium rates in the event our health care costs increase. 33 Table of Contents A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. A reduction in the number of members in our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could contribute to the loss of membership include: competition in premium or plan benefits from other health care benefit companies; reductions in the number of employers offering health care coverage; reductions in work force by existing customers; our increases in premiums or benefit changes; our exit from a market or the termination of a health plan; and negative publicity and news coverage relating to our company or the managed health care industry generally. We do not currently anticipate additional growth through acquisitions in 2005 Part of our growth strategy historically has been to grow through the acquisition of additional health plans. During the last several years, we have significantly increased our membership through a number of acquisitions. Because of the size of the First Health acquisition, we anticipate that our management will focus on the integration of First Health and we do not currently intend to acquire additional health plans in 2005. Competition in our industry may limit our ability to attract new members or to increase or maintain our premium rates, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive environment that may affect our ability to attract new members and increase premium rates. We compete with other health plans for members. We believe the principal factors influencing the choice among health care options are: price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives such as self insurance; location and choice of health care providers; quality of customer service; comprehensiveness of coverage offered; reputation for quality care; financial stability of the plan; and diversity of product offerings. We face competition from other managed care companies that may have broader geographical coverage, more established reputations in our markets, greater market share, larger contracting scale, lower costs and or greater financial and other resources. We also may face increased rate competition from certain Blue Cross plan competitors that might be required by state regulation to reduce capital surpluses that may be deemed excessive. Competition in the Federal Employees Benefit Plan and recent plan design changes in the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan may reduce membership and revenues. The Mail Handlers Benefit Plan, which is administered by First Health, competes against a number of national carriers and local health plans for Federal employee membership. First Health has sought through plan design changes, including premium increases, changes in employee cost sharing and benefit changes, to create a more attractive and competitive Mail Handlers product offering to attract new members as well as retain existing members. As these new products are introduced for 2005, it is expected that there will be some loss of existing membership as the new benefit plans may be more attractive to potential members than existing members. In addition, the new plan design changes for the 2005 benefit plan year may result in a greater than expected loss of membership if these products are not as attractive or competitive as we anticipate. Competition in the multi site, national account business may limit our ability to grow revenues which could adversely affect our results of operations. First Health competes in a highly competitive environment against other major national managed care companies in its Corporate line of business to provide administrative, network access, and medical management services to large, multi site, self insured employers. Among these competitors are Aetna, United Healthcare and Blue Card (a joint venture of major Blue Cross plans), all of which have greater resources, brand identity and contracting scale compared to First Health or Coventry. 34 Table of Contents We depend on the services of non exclusive independent agents and brokers to market our products to employers, and we can not assure you that they will continue to market our products in the future. We depend on the services of independent agents and brokers to market our managed care products and services, particularly to small employer group members. We do not have long term contracts with independent agents and brokers, who typically are not dedicated exclusively to us and frequently market the health care products of our competitors. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers, and we can not assure you that agents and brokers will continue to market our products in a fair and consistent manner. Our failure to obtain cost effective agreements with a sufficient number of providers may result in higher medical costs and a decrease in our membership. Our future results largely depend on our ability to enter into cost effective agreements with hospitals, physicians and other health care providers. The terms of those provider contracts will have a material effect on our medical costs and our ability to control these costs. In addition, our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will impact the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in those markets. In some of our markets, there are large provider systems that have a major presence. Some of these large provider systems have operated their own health plans in the past or may choose to do so in the future. These provider systems could adversely affect our product offerings and results of operations if they refuse to contract with us, place us at a competitive disadvantage or use their market position to negotiate contracts that are less favorable to us. Provider agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiations. We can not assure you that these large provider systems will continue to contract with us or that they will contract with us on terms that are favorable to us. Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular could adversely affect our results of operations or business. Over the last several years, the managed health care industry has been subject to negative publicity. Negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry generally or our company in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by: requiring us to change our products and services; increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate; or adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services. Negative publicity relating to our company or the managed care industry generally also may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members. A failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We depend on our information technology systems for timely and accurate information. Failure to maintain effective and efficient information technology systems or disruptions in our information technology systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, loss of existing customers, difficulty in attracting new customers, disputes with customers and providers, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses and other adverse consequences. The anticipated benefits of acquiring First Health may not be realized. We anticipate our acquisition of First Health will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position, cross selling opportunities, technology, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the First Health acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate First Health in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. 35 Table of Contents We may face substantial difficulties, costs and delays in integrating First Health. These factors may include: potential difficulty in leveraging the value of the separate technologies of the combined company; perceived adverse changes in product offerings available to customers and customer services standards, whether or not these changes do, in fact, occur; managing customer and provider overlap and potential pricing conflicts; costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures; potential charges to earnings resulting from the application of purchase accounting to the transaction; difficulty comparing financial reports due to differing management systems; diversion of management resources from the business of the combined company; the retention of existing customers of each company, including, with respect to First Health, the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan (a nationally offered health plan for federal employees); reduction or loss of customer orders due to the potential for market confusion, hesitation and delay; retaining and integrating management and other key employees of the combined company; and coordinating infrastructure operations in an effective and efficient manner. After the First Health acquisition, we may seek to combine certain operations and functions using common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls and human resource practices, including training, professional development and benefit programs. We may be unsuccessful in implementing the integration of these systems and processes. For its fiscal year 2003, First Healths revenues were approximately $891 million. While we believe that the companies share certain similar cultural characteristics and philosophies, the differences in size and scope of operations may affect our management processes. Any one or all of these factors, many of which are outside of our control, may cause increased operating costs, worse than anticipated financial performance or the loss of customers and employees. Many of these factors are also outside the control of either company. We conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and changes in laws or regulations or violations of regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business is heavily regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we currently do business may in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations. Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include changes that: impose increased liability for adverse consequences of medical decisions; limit premium levels; increase minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; impose fines or other penalties for the failure to pay claims promptly; impose fines or other penalties as a result of market conduct reviews; prohibit or limit rental access to health care provider networks; prohibit or limit provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements; require health plans to offer expanded or new benefits; limit the ability of health plans to manage care and utilization due to any willing provider and direct access laws that restrict or prohibit product features that encourage members to seek services from contracted providers or through referral by a primary care provider; limit contractual terms with providers, including audit, payment and termination provisions; implement mandatory third party review processes for coverage denials; and impose additional health care information privacy or security requirements. We also may be subject to governmental investigations or inquiries from time to time. For example, several companies in the insurance industry have received subpoenas for information from the New York Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General with respect to an industry wide investigation into certain insurance brokerage practices, including broker compensation arrangements, bid quoting practices and potential antitrust violations. Insurance regulators in several states, including states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled, have sent letters of inquiry concerning similar matters to the companies subject to this jurisdiction, including our subsidiaries. We have furnished the information requested and have cooperated with the insurance regulatory authorities. The existence of such investigations in our industry could negatively impact the market value of all companies in our industry including our stock price. Any similar governmental investigations of Coventry could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business or result in significant liabilities to the Company, as well as adverse publicity. 36 Table of Contents In addition, we are required to obtain and maintain various regulatory approvals to market many of our products. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could adversely impact our results of operations. Federal, state and local authorities frequently consider changes to laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business. We can not predict the changes that government authorities will approve in the future or assure you that those changes will not have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We face periodic reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business. We contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide managed health care services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in: refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts; imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions on us; loss of our right to participate in various federal programs; damage to our reputation in various markets; increased difficulty in selling our products and services; and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or HMO or to otherwise provide a service. We are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation based on new or evolving legal theories, that could adversely affect our results of operations. Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations including claims relating to: our denial of non covered benefits; vicarious liability for our actions or medical malpractice claims; disputes with our providers over alleged violations of RICO; disputes with our providers over compensation and termination of provider contracts; disputes related to our non risk business, including actions alleging breach of fiduciary duties, claim administration errors and failure to disclose network rate discounts and other fee and rebate arrangements; disputes over our co payment calculations; customer audits of our compliance with our plan obligations; and disputes over payments for out of network benefits. In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against managed care companies. Recent court decisions and legislative activity increase our exposure to these types of claims. In some cases, plaintiffs may seek class action status and substantial economic, non economic or punitive damages. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In the event a plaintiff were to obtain a significant damage award it may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We can not determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on the managed care industry in general or on us in particular. We have, and expect to maintain, liability insurance coverage for some of the potential legal liabilities we may incur. Currently, professional liability and employment practices liability insurance is covered through our captive subsidiary. Potential liabilities that we incur may not, however, be covered by insurance, our insurers may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance coverage may be inadequate. We can not assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future, or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis, if at all. Our stock price and trading volume may be volatile. 37 Table of Contents From time to time, the price and trading volume of our common stock, as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry may experience periods of significant volatility. Company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry (including the regulatory environment) and the capital markets may cause this volatility. Our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including: variations in our operating results; changes in the markets expectations about our future operating results; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally; operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable; news reports relating to trends in our markets; changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business; acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry; and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders, or the perception that such sales could occur. Our indebtedness imposes restrictions on our business and operations. The indentures for our senior notes and bank credit agreement impose restrictions on our business and operations. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; pay dividends or make other restricted payments; create or permit certain liens on our assets; sell assets; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness will depend on numerous factors beyond our control. Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate the cash necessary to service our indebtedness is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. In addition, we will be more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions and competitive pressures as a result of our significant indebtedness. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms. Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could delay, discourage or prevent a change in control of our company that our stockholders consider favorable. 38 Table of Contents We have a stockholder rights plan that may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals. The rights issued under the stockholder rights plan would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors. In addition, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may delay, discourage or prevent a merger, acquisition or change in control involving our company that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions: authorize us to issue preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our board of directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our common stockholders; provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms so that no more than one third of our directors can be replaced at any annual meeting; provide that directors may be removed without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding shares; provide that any amendment or repeal of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation establishing our classified board of directors must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of three fourths of our outstanding shares; and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at a meeting. These provisions of our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. General economic conditions Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The state of the economy could adversely affect our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to collect or increase premiums. The state of the economy could also adversely affect the states budgets, which could result in the states attempting to reduce payments to Medicaid plans in those states in which we offer Medicaid plans, and increase taxes and assessments on our activities. Although we could attempt to mitigate or cover our exposure from such increased costs through, among other things, increases in premiums, there can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate or cover all of such costs resulting from any budget cuts in states in which we operate. Although we have attempted to diversify our product offerings to address the changing needs of our membership, the effects of economic conditions could cause our existing membership to seek health coverage alternatives that we do not offer or could result in significant membership loss, lower average premium yields or decreased margins on continuing membership. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. The investment policy specifically prohibits purchasing investments in any equities or in fixed income securities that are below investment grade. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Administration and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. 39 Table of Contents Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. See Note E to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. Our investments at December 31, 2004 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): As of December 31, 2004 Amortized Cost Fair Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 409,960 $ 409,792 1 to 5 years 463,727 468,624 5 to 10 years 234,421 240,220 Over 10 years 188,919 191,465 Total short term and long term securities $ 1,297,027 $ 1,310,101 Our projections of hypothetical net gains in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
