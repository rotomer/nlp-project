Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows. Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Risk Factors Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a national managed health care company based in Bethesda, Maryland operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental / managed care services companies, and workers compensation services companies. We provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services, including health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), point of service (POS), Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, Medicaid, Workers Compensation and Network Rental to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Highlights of 2005 Performance Health Plan membership increased 1.5% over the prior year. Revenue increased 24.5% over the prior year. Health Plan only revenue increased 9.3% over the prior year. Health Plan medical loss ratio of 79.5% improved 100 basis points over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 17.9% of operating revenues, Health Plan only selling, general and administrative expense was 11.4%, a 10 basis point improvement over the prior year. Operating margin of 12.0% improved 260 basis points over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 25.0% over the prior year. Cash flows from operations were $804.5 million, a 77.2% improvement over the prior year. Total cash and investments was $2.1 billion, a 19.4% increase over the prior year. Operating Revenue and Products We generate our operating revenues from premiums for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our PPO and POS products are typically lower than our HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, fiscal agent services (generally for state entitlement programs), claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. During the three years ended December 31, 2005, we experienced substantial growth in operating revenues due in part to membership increases from health plan acquisitions and more recently, as a result of the acquisition of First Health Group (First Health). We generally seek acquisitions that we believe have a manageable regulatory and business climate and have the ability to add value to our company. Additionally, membership growth was achieved organically through marketing efforts, geographic expansion and increased product offerings. Our ability to introduce products quickly to each market has helped us to expand our customer base. In particular, we have been able to add a large variety of lower cost products, which has proven attractive to customers. 26 Operating Expenses Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies. We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services, such as mental health care, and a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically, cost effective appropriate services. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions for our health plans. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices at each of our plans and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. We centralize the underwriting and product pricing functions for our health plans, which allows us to utilize our underwriting expertise and a disciplined pricing strategy at each of our health plans. First Health operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administrative services offered by the Company. To a lesser extent, the operating expenses include facility expenses and information processing costs needed to provide those administrative services. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have not needed to use financing methods to fund operations. While we did incur debt in 2005 (as described in Note H to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K), the entire proceeds were used to finance an acquisition and were not used to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions and for repurchases of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2005, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $20.6 million compared with approximately $6.7 million at December 31, 2004. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $3.6 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for the older receivables. The allowances have increased as a result of the acquisition of First Health. 27 We also receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM who perform periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHB Program. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We record reserves, on an estimated basis annually, for audit and other contract adjustments based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone on hold time, etc. We also enter into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per member per month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, we estimate and record performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarial developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we have experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. 28 The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively (in thousands). 2005 2004 2003 Medical liabilities, beginning of period $ 660,475 $ 597,190 $ 558,599 Acquisitions (1) 41,895 38,828 Reported Medical Costs Current year 4,672,009 4,257,942 3,693,821 Prior year developments (121,138) (72,047) (86,532) Total reported medical costs 4,550,871 4,185,895 3,607,289 Claim Payments Payments for current year 4,030,685 3,691,092 3,235,902 Payments for prior year 469,782 431,518 371,624 Total claim payments 4,500,467 4,122,610 3,607,526 Medical liabilities, end of period $ 752,774 $ 660,475 $ 597,190 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 2.9% 2.0% 3.0% Current year paid percent (3) 86.3% 86.7% 87.6% (1) Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2005 prior year medical costs relate almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2004 and the increase in prior year medical cost was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical cost increases and growth in the medical cost base. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization, and other factors. Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2005 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase (Decrease) in Completion Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 3.6 % $ (19,438) (6.0) % $ (59,999) (5.0) % $ (9,297) 2.0 % $ (10,991) (3.0) % $ (30,000) (2.5) % $ (4,648) 1.0 % $ (5,558) (1.0) % $ (10,000) (1.0) % $ (1,859) (1.0) % $ 5,686 1.0 % $ 10,000 1.0 % $ 1,859 (2.0) % $ 11,504 3.0 % $ 30,000 2.5 % $ 4,648 (3.6) % $ 21,101 6.0 % $ 59,999 5.0 % $ 9,297 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. Accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. Certain situations require judgment in setting reserves, such as system conversions, processing interruptions, environmental changes or other factors. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2005; however, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. 29 Investments We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The following table shows our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value, at December 31, 2005, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss State and municipal bonds $ 173,544 $ (1,847) $ 70,857 $ (1,738) $ 244,401 $ (3,585) US Treasury & agency securities 54,273 (487) 31,989 (586) 86,262 (1,073) Mortgage backed securities 102,427 (1,559) 45,034 (1,273) 147,461 (2,832) Asset backed securities 25,915 (412) 20,600 (539) 46,515 (951) Corporate debt and other securities 151,712 (1,027) 102,616 (3,206) 254,328 (4,233) $ 507,871 $ (5,332) $ 271,096 $ (7,342) $ 778,967 $ (12,674) The securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporarily impaired investment. The current unrealized loss is almost exclusively the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. These investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value. Goodwill and Other Long lived Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. For our impairment analysis of the Health Plan segment goodwill, we used three approaches to identify the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets: a market approach, a market capitalization approach and an income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of the companys estimated future cash flows, and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return. All three approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. For our impairment analysis of the First Health segment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset, we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our analysis. For the First Health goodwill impairment analysis, we relied primarily on the income approach and secondarily on the market approach. For the First Health indefinite lived asset, we relied on two separate variations of the income approach. Each approach was reviewed together for consistency and commonality. Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets. 30 Our remaining long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. In accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project. We periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. New Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, and amends SFAS No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a rule that amends the compliance date for SFAS No. 123(R). The rule allowed the Company to delay the implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) until January 1, 2006. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized beginning on the adoption date based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company accounted for share based payments to employees using APB No. 25s intrinsic value method through December 31, 2005 and, as such, has recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)s fair value method will have an effect on its results of operations, although it will have no material effect on its overall financial position. The effect of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will depend on the value and levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, assuming share based payments are granted in 2006 at values and levels granted in 2005, the Company expects the diluted earnings per share effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) to be a $0.13 to $0.14 reduction for the full year of 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company can not estimate what those amounts will be in the future (as it is dependent upon, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amounts of operating cash flows that were recognized in prior periods for such excess tax benefits were $38.0 million, $21.4 million, and $18.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Acquisitions During the three years ended December 31, 2005, we completed several business combinations and membership purchases. These business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to twenty years. The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2005. The purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The purchase price shown for recent acquisitions, in millions, is inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements and transaction cost adjustments.

First Health is a full service national health benefits services company that serves the group health, workers compensation and state public program markets. Each outstanding share of First Health common stock was converted into a right to receive $9.375 cash and 0.2687 shares of Coventry common stock. As a result of the merger, we paid $863.1 million in cash and issued approximately 24.7 million shares of our common stock to stockholders of First Health. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of First Health have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The purchase price for First Health was allocated to the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, based on estimated fair values. For additional information regarding the First Health acquisition, please refer to Note B to our consolidated financial statements. Membership The following table presents our Health Plan membership as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands) and the percentage change in membership between these dates. December 31, Percent 2005 2004 Change Risk membership: Commercial 1,486 1,483 0.2% Medicare 75 69 8.7% Medicaid 393 397 (1.0%) Total risk membership 1,954 1,949 0.3% Non risk membership 592 560 5.7% Total membership 2,546 2,509 1.5% Commercial insured membership increased over the prior year end due to strong sales and retention, especially in the third and fourth quarters. These membership gains were partially offset by the loss, during the first quarter of 2005, of a large commercial insured account to an administrative services only (ASO) bid and a large existing group in the Kansas market that changed from a risk product to a non risk product effective January 1, 2005. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused significant destruction and flooding in Southern Louisiana, most notably in the greater New Orleans area. As a result of its effects, we lost 11,000 commercial insured members in our Louisiana operations in the fourth quarter of 2005 and expect additional losses of membership in 2006. Medicare membership increased primarily as a result of the membership obtained in the West Virginia market. Legislation in Missouri was approved that changed the eligibility requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries throughout the state. We lost 23,000 Medicaid members in our Missouri market through the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. These losses were offset by Medicaid member growth in our Pennsylvania and West Virginia markets. The increase in non risk membership was attributable to a large group in the Kansas market changing from a risk product to a non risk, as described above, as well as from additional organic growth obtained in the North Carolina market. These gains were partially offset by the loss of a large existing ASO account to another third party administrator during the first quarter of 2005. 32 Results of Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 (in thousands, except EPS and membership). Increase Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) 2004 2003 (Decrease) Consolidated Business (1) Total operating revenues $ 6,611,246 $ 5,311,969 24.5% $ 5,311,969 $ 4,535,143 17.1% Operating earnings $ 791,818 $ 496,671 59.4% $ 496,671 $ 366,197 35.6% Net earnings $ 501,639 $ 337,117 48.8% $ 337,117 $ 250,145 34.8% Diluted earnings per share $ 3.10 $ 2.48 25.0% $ 2.48 $ 1.83 35.3% Selling, general and administrative 17.9% 11.5% 6.4% 11.5% 12.0% (0.5%) as a percentage of revenue Health Plan Business Managed Care Premium Yields (per member per month): Commercial $ 246.46 $ 226.59 8.8% $ 226.59 $ 206.08 10.0% Medicare $ 765.58 $ 695.96 10.0% $ 695.96 $ 629.52 10.6% Medicaid $ 157.52 $ 145.23 8.5% $ 145.23 $ 139.69 4.0% Medical Costs (per member per month): Commercial $ 193.37 $ 179.21 7.9% $ 179.21 $ 164.59 8.9% Medicare $ 614.55 $ 579.92 6.0% $ 579.92 $ 527.84 9.9% Medicaid $ 133.32 $ 126.88 5.1% $ 126.88 $ 122.25 3.8% Medical Loss Ratios: Commercial 78.5% 79.1% (0.6%) 79.1% 79.9% (0.8%) Medicare 80.3% 83.3% (3.0%) 83.3% 83.8% (0.5%) Medicaid 84.6% 87.4% (2.8%) 87.4% 87.5% (0.1%) Total 79.5% 80.5% (1.0%) 80.5% 81.2% (0.7%) Administrative Statistics: Selling, general and administrative 11.4% 11.5% (0.1%) 11.5% 12.0% (0.5%) as a percentage of revenue Days in medical liabilities 55.6 55.8 (0.2) 55.8 56.7 (0.9) First Health Business (1) Membership National Accounts On going accounts 669,000 n/a Run out (2) 90,000 n/a Total National Accounts 759,000 n/a Mail Handlers 462,000 n/a Revenue by product lines National Accounts $ 141,283 n/a Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan 204,678 n/a Network Rental 89,442 n/a Group Health Subtotal 435,403 n/a Medicaid/Public Sector 183,197 n/a Workers Compensation 193,714 n/a Specialty Business Subtotal 376,911 n/a Total First Health Revenues $ 812,314 n/a Administrative Statistics: Selling, general and administrative 64.9% n/a as a percentage of revenue (1) Results of Operations includes First Health since January 28, 2005, the date of acquisition.

Commercial yields (premium per member per month) increased as a result of rate increases on renewals. Medicare yields increased as a result of the rate increases on January 1, 2005 from the annual Adjusted Community Rating filings. Medicaid yields increased as a result of a rate increase of 6.5% effective January 1, 2005 in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, and as a result of the OmniCare acquisition which has a higher yield than our historical Medicaid membership. The acquisition of OmniCare effective October 1, 2004 and First Health effective January 28, 2005 accounted for $151.9 million of the increase in managed care premium revenue over the prior year. The First Health acquisition closed January 28, 2005 and, therefore, only results from January 28, 2005 through December 31, 2005 are included in our results of operations. Management services revenue increased almost entirely due to the acquisition of First Health. The acquisition of First Health accounted for $764.0 million of the increase in management services revenue over the prior year. Medical costs have increased due to medical trend and acquisitions. However, Health Plan medical expense as a percentage of managed care premium revenue has improved to 79.5% compared to 80.5% in the prior year. This favorable change was attributable to premium rate increases discussed above outpacing medical trend in each of our Health Plan lines of business. The favorable change was also attributable to favorable inpatient utilization during 2005, particularly in the third and fourth quarters, and a flu season in the first quarter of 2005 that was not as severe as it has been in previous years. Total reported commercial medical trend (per member per month), net of buydowns, was 7.9% in 2005. Days in total medical claims liabilities decreased slightly from the prior year due primarily to faster claim receipts and continually improved processing cycle times. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to normal operating costs of First Health, which accounted for $523.7 million of the increase in selling, general and administrative expense. Additional increases include an increase in salary expense, Medicare Part D implementation costs and a full twelve months of normal operating costs of OmniCare. Salary expenses, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to annual compensation increases and additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in 2004 and 2005. However, Health Plan selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of continuing revenue growth and success in controlling administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization increased almost exclusively as a result of the acquisition of First Health. Depreciation expense for First Health, primarily for computer equipment and software, was $36.8 million and amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of First Health was $27.7 million. Interest expense increased as a result of the indebtedness incurred with the acquisition of First Health. Additionally, we refinanced our credit facilities during the second quarter. As a result, we wrote off $5.4 million of deferred financing costs related to the original credit facilities. Other income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio and a rise in short term rates during the year. Our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in earnings. The effective tax rate increased to 37.3% in 2005 from 36.0% in 2004 primarily as a result of the First Health acquisition and a related change in the relative mix of states with income tax provisions. Comparison of 2004 to 2003 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets, acquisitions and organic growth. Commercial yields (premium per member per month) increased as a result of rate increases on renewals that occurred throughout all markets. Medicare yields increased as a result of the rate increases from the annual Adjusted Community Rating filings and from the Medicare Modernization Act. The rate increases from the Medicare Modernization Act were required to be used for enhanced member benefits and or network access and thus did not affect profitability. The acquisition of Altius effective September 1, 2003 and OmniCare effective October 1, 2004 accounted for $208.7 million of the increase in managed care premium revenue over the prior year. Management services revenue increased due to the increase in non risk membership influenced by three large groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product effective January 1, 2004, as well as from additional organic membership obtained in the Missouri market. Medical costs have increased due to medical trend, acquisitions and organic growth. However, total medical expense as a percentage of managed care premium revenue has improved to 80.5% over the prior year. This favorable change was attributable mostly to our commercial business and is a result of the commercial premium rate increases mentioned above outpacing commercial medical trend. Reported commercial medical trend, net of benefit buy downs, was 8.9% in 2004. Our Medicare business medical loss ratio improved compared to the prior year as a result of the increase in premium yields discussed above. Our overall Medicaid medical loss ratio was essentially flat compared to prior year. Excluding OmniCare, the Medicaid medical loss ratio would have improved to 86.9%. The same store improvement is as a result of rate increases across our markets and as a result of much improved performance in our Medicaid Virginia market. The Virginia market benefited from lower utilization, lower drug costs and favorable provider contract renegotiations. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to normal operating costs of recent acquisitions, an increase in broker commissions and an increase in salary expenses. Broker commissions, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to the growth in both organic membership and in premium rates. Salary expenses, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to annual compensation increases, additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in 2003 and 2004, and incremental compensation expense related to our organic membership growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of continuing revenue growth and success in controlling customer service costs. 34 Other income increased due to an increase in interest income as a result of higher interest rates and as a result of a larger investment portfolio in 2004. Additionally, 2003 other income included a gain from sale of our single derivative investment which partially offsets the 2004 increase. Our provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in earnings before taxes. The effective tax rate decreased to 36.0% in 2004 from 36.4% in 2003. Days in total medical claims liabilities decreased from the prior year due primarily to faster claim receipts and continually improved processing cycle times. Hurricane Katrina As described earlier, the effects of Hurricane Katrina affected the operations of our local Louisiana Health Plan. The Louisiana Department of Insurance imposed an emergency order governing claim payments and premium collection procedures. The Louisiana Department of Insurance emergency order rules prohibited the termination of members from August 26, 2005 to November 30, 2005 and required that members be allowed to access out of network providers at the in network benefit level. Additionally, our New Orleans in network provider community has changed as a result of the closure of certain facilities within our New Orleans provider network. As a result, medical costs have increased significantly. The reduced membership, allowances for premium receivables and higher medical costs experienced by our Louisiana Health Plan reduced our fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.04 per diluted share. That order expired at the end of November 2005 and our Louisiana Health Plan is back to more normal operating protocols. Going forward, we expect the Louisiana Health Plan to operate as a profitable, but smaller, business. Medicare Part D The Medicare Part D program, which gives beneficiaries access to prescription drug coverage, took effect January 1, 2006. Coventry has been awarded contracts by the CMS to offer various Medicare Part D plans on a nationwide basis, in accordance with guidelines put forth by the agency. Coventry submitted bids as a national prescription drug plan sponsor in all 34 CMS established regions. The bids are designed to provide solutions for individuals, employer groups and low income populations. Our primary retail distribution strategy for the Medicare Part D program is through distribution alliances with other insurers and retail operations. During the third quarter of 2005, we received approval to offer Part D Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) in all 34 regions. We also qualified in all 13 regions where we sought to participate in the auto assignment of low income beneficiaries. The PDP plans will be marketed under the brand names of Advantra Rx and First Health Premier and include options with first dollar coverage (no deductible). Products will be underwritten by Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company, First Health Life and Health Insurance Company and Cambridge Life Insurance Company. We have established partnerships with Medicare Supplement insurance carriers and brokerage channels nationwide to provide Medicare Part D prescription drug products to Medicare beneficiaries. We have incurred approximately $12.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2005 preparing for the implementation of this program. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a vast majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. In addition to ample current liquidity, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs. Our investment guidelines emphasize investment grade fixed income instruments in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA+ and an average contractual duration of 2.2 years, as of December 31, 2005. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities, and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. Our total cash and investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $49.4 million restricted under state regulations, increased $308.9 million to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005 from $1.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The demand for our products and services are subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. Please refer to the section entitled Risk Factors in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. 35 Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2005, operating cash flow was positively affected by an increase in medical liabilities and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. Medical liabilities have increased due primarily to an increase in medical claims incurred but not reported in certain markets and an increase in capitation payable amounts owed related to our Pennsylvania Medicaid product. Accounts payable and other liabilities increased as a result of an increase in taxes payable, an increase in interest payable and an increase in deferred compensation liabilities. Cash flow from operating activities has improved over the prior year as a result of higher earnings and a larger increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. Financing and Investing Activities Proceeds from the issuance of debt include indebtedness incurred related to the acquisition of First Health, less payments made for debt issuance costs. The issuance of debt includes $500 million of new senior notes, unsecured credit facilities consisting of a $300 million five year term loan and $65 million from a revolving credit facility drawn at closing on January 28, 2005. Proceeds also include new credit facilities the Company entered into on June 30, 2005 providing for a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $350 million, of which $117.5 million was drawn at closing, and a term loan in the principal amount of $100 million. Payments for retirement of debt include the repayment of a $200 million long term credit facility assumed from the acquisition of First Health, repayment of the $365 million original credit facilities and the $117.5 million repayment of the new revolving credit facility. The senior notes and credit facilities require compliance with specified financial ratios and contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and restricting sales of assets above a certain threshold and consolidations or mergers in the context of a change of control. We have complied with all ratios and covenants under the senior notes and credit facilities. Capital expenditures in 2005 of approximately $71.4 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems and Medicare Part D infrastructure. Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, no shares of common stock were purchased in 2003, 3.0 million shares during the first quarter of 2004 at an aggregate cost of $84.6 million and no shares were purchased in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under the program is approximately 2.6 million. Excluded from these amounts are shares purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as these purchases are not part of the program. In February 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the repurchase authorization in an amount equal to 5% of our outstanding common stock thus increasing our repurchase authorization by 8.1 million shares. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2005, we received $258.6 million in dividends and $1.9 million for note repayments from our regulated subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted an RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. We have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above 250% of their RBC and a level of 300% in aggregate (referred to below as 300% of RBC). Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in millions, except percentage data). 2005 2004 Regulated capital and surplus $ 868.5 (a) $ 727.3 300% of RBC $ 555.4 (a) $ 515.4 (a) Excess capital and surplus above 300% of RBC $ 313.1 (a) $ 211.9 (a) Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC 469% (a) 423% (a) Statutory deposits $ 49.4 $ 23.1 (a) unaudited 36 The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of income, the inclusion of regulated subsidiaries acquired with First Health and capital contributions offset by dividends paid to the parent company. The increase in statutory deposits is a result of the inclusion of deposits held by the regulated subsidiaries acquired with First Health. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and multiple Department of Insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our investment in an equipment leasing limited liability company, we had cash and investments of approximately $347.2 million and $383.1 million at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. The decline is a result of cash and investments used related to the First Health acquisition and debt repayment offset by dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we made capital contributions to our subsidiaries of $8.1 million. Other As of December 31, 2005, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Senior notes $ 670,500 $ $ $ $ 670,500 Interest payable on senior notes 313,581 41,686 83,373 83,373 105,149 Credit Facilities 100,000 10,000 20,000 70,000 Interest payable on credit facilities 20,958 5,525 9,550 5,883 Software purchases 40,000 29,000 5,500 5,500 Operating leases 144,132 28,082 49,795 34,500 31,755 Total contractual obligations 1,289,171 114,293 168,218 199,256 807,404 Less sublease income (8,332) (1,246) (2,357) (2,219) (2,510) Net contractual obligations $ 1,280,839 $ 113,047 $ 165,861 $ 197,037 $ 804,894 The Companys contract with the National Postal Mail Handlers Union requires that the Company fund any Plan expenses in the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan after the Plans reserves have been fully utilized. We believe the Plans reserves as of December 31, 2005 are sufficient to cover Plan expenses. Refer to Note I to our consolidated financial statement for disclosure related to our operating leases. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within 6 months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within 9 months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. Other Disclosure Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied us, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2005 may result in the assertion of additional claims. We maintain general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described below, will individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are a defendant in the provider track of the In Re: Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Multi District Litigation (MDL), No. 1334, in the action captioned, Charles B. Shane., et al., vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against Coventry and nine other companies in the managed care industry. The plaintiffs have alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these federal law claims, the complaint includes state law claims for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court has dismissed several of the state law claims and ordered that all physicians who have an arbitration provision in their provider contracts must submit their direct RICO claims and all of their remaining state law claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, all the plaintiffs who have arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed all of their claims that are subject to arbitration. The trial court however has ordered that the plaintiffs claims of conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting violations of RICO are not subject to arbitration. The defendants appeal to the 11th Circuit challenging the trial courts arbitration decision was denied. 37 The trial court has certified various subclasses of plaintiffs. The defendants filed an appeal of that certification order to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals has overturned the class certification order as to the plaintiffs state law claims but affirmed the certification with respect to the plaintiffs federal law claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has denied the defendants petition to review the 11th Circuits class certification decision. As a result of the class certification decision, the only causes of action remaining in the lawsuit are the claims of (1) conspiracy to violate RICO and (2) aiding and abetting violations of RICO. Seven defendants have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs which have received final approval from the trial court. The claims against one defendant have been dismissed. Two defendants remain, including the Company. The trial of this lawsuit is tentatively scheduled to start September 18, 2006. The Shane lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors, podiatrists, acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals. Each of these actions has been transferred to the MDL and have been designated as tag along actions. The court has entered an order which stays all proceedings in the tag along actions until all pre trial proceedings in the Shane action have been concluded. Although we can not predict the outcome, management believes that the Shane lawsuit and the tag along actions will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or its results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to defend our position. Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. Although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term. Nevertheless, it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2006 Outlook Our health plans operate in highly competitive markets, but in the aggregate we believe that the pricing environment is generally rational in our existing markets, thus creating the opportunity for reasonable price increases. We will continue to obtain adequate premium increases for our commercial business and expect premium rates to continue to rise at a rate equal to or greater than medical trend in 2006. Management believes that existing markets have potential for premium growth for our commercial and governmental products. We expect the new Medicare Part D program to contribute $0.08 to our 2006 full year earnings per diluted share. We estimate a loss of $0.08 in the first quarter of 2006, a smaller loss in the second quarter of 2006, and increasing profits in the third and fourth quarters of 2006 to get to the total $0.08 gain for the full year of 2006. This incremental contribution to earnings per share excludes the effect of the expected losses of First Health fee based revenue of $31 million and associated earnings per share reductions of $.06 relating to the termination of dual eligible administration and senior pharmacy discount card business as a result of the implementation of the Medicare Part D program. Additionally, we will begin to incur expense effective January 1, 2006 related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). We estimate the effect of the adoption of SFAS 123(R) to reduce earnings by $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2006 and by $0.13 to $0.14 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2006. Risk Factors See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Prior to the acquisition of First Health, our Investment Policy and Guidelines did not permit equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. As described in the notes to the financials, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health. The Board approved modifications to our investment guidelines by adopting a permitted exception to allow for such investments if, in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. We determined it would not be in our best interest to liquidate this investment and therefore the investment in the equipment leasing limited liability company was approved as a permitted exception. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. 38 We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Administration and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. See Note E to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments.

The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
