Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows. Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Medicare Private Fee For Service Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Risk Factors Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a national managed health care company based in Bethesda, Maryland operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental/managed care services companies, and workers compensation services companies. We provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services, including health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), point of service (POS), Medicare Advantage, Medicare Prescription Drug Plans, Medicaid, Workers Compensation and Network Rental to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Summary of 2006 Performance Health Plan membership decreased .9% over the prior year, excluding the new Medicare Part D business. Medicare Part D revenues of $669.9 million and membership of 687,000. Revenue increased 17% over the prior year. Health Plan medical loss ratio of 78.9% improved 60 basis points over the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were 17.3% of operating revenues, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin of 10.9% declined 110 basis points over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 11.9% over the prior year. Cash flows from operations were $1,066 million (including $348.6 million related to the new Medicare Part D business), a 32.6% increase over the prior year. Total cash and investments was $2.8 billion, a 35.4% increase over the prior year. 32 Operating Revenue and Products We generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees from a broad range of managed care and management service products. Premiums for our risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our commercial PPO and commercial POS products are typically lower than our commercial HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the commercial PPO and commercial POS members. Premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies in conjunction with competitive bidding processes. Medicare products, including Part D, have risk adjusted premium rates at the member level to help align expected cost and reimbursement. These government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, fiscal agent services (generally for state entitlement programs), claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. Operating Expenses Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies. We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services, such as mental health care, and a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. We have established systems that monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically, cost effective appropriate services. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions for our health plans. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices at each of our plans and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. We centralize the underwriting and product pricing functions for our health plans, which allows us to utilize our underwriting expertise and a disciplined pricing strategy at each of our health plans. First Health operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administrative services offered by the Company. To a lesser extent, the operating expenses include facility expenses and information processing costs needed to provide those administrative services. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have not needed to use financing methods to fund operations. While we did incur debt (as described in Note I to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K), the entire proceeds were used to finance an acquisition and were not used to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions, to prepay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 33 Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2006, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $20.1 million compared with approximately $20.6 million at December 31, 2005. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $1.9 million and $3.6 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for the older receivables. We also receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM who perform periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHB Program. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We record reserves, on an estimated basis annually, for audit and other contract adjustments based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone on hold time, etc. We also enter into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per member per month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, we estimate and record performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. 34 We employ a team of actuaries that have used a set of reserve models that are based on a consistent methodology. Although the calculation is consistent, we adjust our estimates of medical utilization and components of medical cost trends to amounts we estimate to be appropriate. The medical liabilities are an accumulation of the results from many individual models, each calculated at the statutory level and representing different markets and or products. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarial developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we have experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively (in thousands). 2006 2005 2004 Medical liabilities, beginning of period $ 752,774 $ 660,475 $ 597,190 Acquisitions (1) 41,895 Reported Medical Costs Current year 5,570,872 4,672,009 4,257,942 Prior year developments (130,908) (121,138) (72,047) Total reported medical costs 5,439,964 4,550,871 4,185,895 Claim Payments Payments for current year 4,852,359 4,030,685 3,691,092 Payments for prior year 542,571 469,782 431,518 Total claim payments 5,394,930 4,500,467 4,122,610 Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities 323,343 Medical liabilities, end of period $ 1,121,151 $ 752,774 $ 660,475 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 2.9% 2.9% 2.0% Current year paid percent (3) 87.1% 86.3% 86.7% (1) Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. 35 The negative amounts noted as prior year medical costs are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2006 prior year medical costs relate almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2005 and the increase in prior year medical cost was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical cost increases, growth in the medical cost base and uncertainties at the prior year end regarding our Louisiana operations and the effects of Hurricane Katrina. The Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represent subsidy amounts received from CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. Following the final settlement in 2007 related to the 2006 plan year, any remaining balances from these subsidy payments will be refunded to CMS. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization, and other factors. Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2006 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase (Decrease) in Completion Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 3.3 % $ (21,471) (5.0) % $ (57,723) (5.0) % $ (13,127) 2.0 % $ (13,196) (2.5) % $ (28,861) (2.5) % $ (6,564) 1.0 % $ (6,671) (1.0) % $ (11,545) (1.0) % $ (2,625) (1.0) % $ 6,820 1.0 % $ 11,545 1.0 % $ 2,625 (2.0) % $ 13,796 2.5 % $ 28,861 2.5 % $ 6,564 (3.3) % $ 23,104 5.0 % $ 57,723 5.0 % $ 13,127 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. Accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term. Certain situations require judgment in setting reserves, such as system conversions, processing interruptions, environmental changes or other factors. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2006 however, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. 36 Investments We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The following table shows our investments gross unrealized losses and fair value, at December 31, 2006, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss State and municipal bonds $ 67,946 $ (275) $ 202,849 $ (3,240) $ 270,795 $ (3,515) U.S. Treasury & agency securities 25,535 (77) 57,171 (750) 82,706 (827) Mortgage backed securities 40,021 (140) 126,151 (2,920) 166,172 (3,060) Asset backed securities 12,909 (26) 33,239 (734) 46,148 (760) Corporate debt and other securities 9,045 (46) 123,032 (2,918) 132,077 (2,964) $ 155,456 $ (564) $ 542,442 $ (10,562) $ 697,898 $ (11,126) The securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporarily impaired investment. The unrealized loss is almost exclusively the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. These investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value, which may be maturity. Goodwill and Other Long lived Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. For our impairment analysis of the Health Plan segment goodwill, we used three approaches to identify the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets: a market approach, a market capitalization approach and an income approach. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The market capitalization approach is based on the market value of our total shares outstanding. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of the companys estimated future cash flows, and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return. All three approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. For our impairment analysis of the First Health segment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset, we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our analysis. For the First Health goodwill impairment analysis, we relied primarily on the income approach and secondarily on the market approach. For the First Health indefinite lived asset, we relied on two separate variations of the income approach. Each approach was reviewed together for consistency and commonality. 37 Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets. Our remaining long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. In accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project. We periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. Stock Based Compensation Expense We account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Shared Based Payment" ("FAS 123R"). Under the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R, determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. We have determined that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of the Companys share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone. Therefore, the expected volatility in 2006 was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock based compensation. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued "Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109", which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial position already taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities. The benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position. FIN 48 was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2007. The change in net assets as a result of applying this pronouncement will be a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change required to be treated as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Companys evaluation of the impact of adoption of FIN 48 is ongoing, and it is anticipated that the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on the Companys January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. Acquisitions During the three years ended December 31, 2006, we completed two business combinations and a membership purchase. These business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to twenty years. 38 The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2006. The purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The purchase price shown for recent acquisitions, in millions, is inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements and transaction cost adjustments. Purchase Effective Date Market Price Business Combinations First Health Group Corp. ("First Health") January 28, 2005 Multiple Markets $ 1,695 Provider Synergies, L.L.C. ("Provider Synergies") January 1, 2006 Multiple Markets $ 22 Membership Purchases OmniCare Health Plan ("OmniCare") October 1, 2004 Michigan $ 13 Effective January 28, 2005, we completed our acquisition of First Health. First Health is a full service national health benefits services company that serves the group health, workers compensation and state public program markets. Each outstanding share of First Health common stock was converted into a right to receive $9.375 cash and 0.2687 shares of Coventry common stock. As a result of the merger, we paid $863.1 million in cash and issued approximately 24.7 million shares of our common stock to stockholders of First Health. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of First Health have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The purchase price for First Health was allocated to the assets, including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, based on estimated fair values. For additional information regarding the First Health acquisition, please refer to Note B to our consolidated financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we completed the acquisition of Provider Synergies, an Ohio limited liability company. Provider Synergies manages preferred drug lists and negotiates rebates on behalf of state government and commercial clients. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of Provider Synergies have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. Membership The following table presents our Health Plan membership as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands) and the percentage change in membership between these dates. December 31, Percent 2006 2005 Change Risk membership: Commercial 1,450 1,486 (2.4%) Medicare 80 75 6.7% Medicaid 373 393 (5.1%) Total risk membership 1,903 1,954 (2.6%) Non risk membership 621 592 4.9% Total membership 2,524 2,546 (0.9%) Commercial insured membership decreased over the prior year end due to losses experienced in our Pennsylvania market and the expected loss of commercial insured members in our Louisiana operations during the first half of 2006, primarily due to Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, there were a few large groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product. These losses were partially offset by gains in employer group business in other markets such as Delaware, Kansas and Georgia and also by growth in individual business across multiple markets. Medicaid membership decreased over the prior year end due to changes in the eligibility requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries throughout the Missouri market as well as the state of North Carolinas termination of its existing managed care program during the third quarter resulting in a loss of approximately 7,400 members. The increase in non risk membership was attributable to organic growth in various markets as well as a few large groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product. 39 Results of Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 (in thousands, except earnings per share and membership data).

Medicare Part D business accounted for $669.9 million of managed care premium revenue in 2006 which excludes $32.6 million attributable to the estimated CMS risk sharing payments that will be due to CMS upon the final settlement in 2007 for the 2006 plan year. Additionally, we have quota share reinsurance arrangements with two of our Medicare Part D distribution partners. As a result of the quota sharing arrangements, we ceded Medicare Part D premium revenue to these partners of $65.8 million. This amount is excluded from the $669.9 million of reported Medicare Part D revenue. Before subtracting the quota share ceded revenue, the premium yield, per member per month, for Medicare Part D business would have been $8.88 higher than the $90.48 reported. When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Part D business, adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. Commercial premium yields (premium per member per month) increased as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets. The reported commercial premium yield increase of 5.3% is lower than the rate increases on renewing business due to a mix change in the types of plans being purchased as new business (such as a change to lower benefit plans); the types of plans being selected by renewing members when they have a choice among multiple options (such as a change to higher deductible, lower premium plans); and the termination of certain large groups which had high costs and high premium yields. Medicare Advantage premium yields increased as a result of the rate increases from the annual Competitive Bid filings. Medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases effective January 1 and July 1, 2006 in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market. Management services revenue decreased partially as a result of declines in membership in the National Accounts and Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan sectors of the First Health segment. Additionally, the implementation of Medicare Part D resulted in a decline of First Health pharmacy administration fee based revenue compared to the prior year, although this decline is more than offset by the increased revenue from our new Medicare Part D business discussed above in the managed care premium revenue section. These decreases are partially offset by reporting a full year of First Health results in 2006. First Health was acquired on January 28, 2005 and therefore only results from January 28, 2005 through December 31, 2005 are included in our 2005 results of operations. Medical costs have increased as a result of new business related to our Medicare Part D products and as a result of medical trend. Medicare Part D medical costs totaled $565.9 million. Excluding Medicare Part D business, Health Plan medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue have declined 0.6% compared with the prior year period. The decline is primarily a result of premium increases and better than expected cost trends. The better than expected cost trends were primarily attributed to lower inpatient and outpatient utilization and the uncertainties at the prior year end regarding our Louisiana operations and the effects from Hurricane Katrina. Days in total medical claims liabilities decreased slightly from the prior year due primarily to faster claim receipts and continually improved processing cycle times. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of costs related to the new Medicare Part D business in 2006, reporting a full year of First Health results in 2006, recognizing stock option expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and increased salary expenses due to annual compensation increases. However, these increases are partially offset by synergies gained subsequent to the acquisition of First Health. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of these achieved synergies, continuing revenue growth and success in controlling overall administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of reporting a full year of First Health results in 2006 and as a result of an increase in property and equipment over the past two years, primarily computer equipment and software related to our First Health business. Interest expense was higher in the prior year as a result of the refinancing of our credit facilities during the prior year second quarter. As a result of the refinancing, we wrote off $5.4 million of deferred financing costs in the prior year second quarter related to the original credit facilities associated with the First Health acquisition. Additionally, our debt has declined over the last two years and, as a result, interest expense related to the indebtedness has also declined. Other income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio and a rise in interest rates during 2005 and 2006. Our provision for income taxes increased almost exclusively due to an increase in earnings. The effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 37.5% in 2006 compared to 37.3% in 2005. 41 Comparison of 2005 to 2004 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets and as a result of acquisitions. Commercial yields (premium per member per month) increased as a result of rate increases on renewals. Medicare yields increased as a result of the rate increases on January 1, 2005 from the annual Adjusted Community Rating filings. Medicaid yields increased as a result of a rate increase of 6.5% effective January 1, 2005 in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, and as a result of the OmniCare acquisition which has a higher yield than our historical Medicaid membership. The acquisition of OmniCare effective October 1, 2004 and First Health effective January 28, 2005 accounted for $151.9 million of the increase in managed care premium revenue over the prior year. The First Health acquisition closed January 28, 2005 and, therefore, only results from January 28, 2005 through December 31, 2005 are included in our results of operations. Management services revenue increased almost entirely due to the acquisition of First Health. The acquisition of First Health accounted for $764.0 million of the increase in management services revenue over the prior year. Medical costs have increased due to medical trend and acquisitions. However, Health Plan medical expense as a percentage of managed care premium revenue has improved to 79.5% compared to 80.5% in the prior year. This favorable change was attributable to premium rate increases discussed above outpacing medical trend in each of our Health Plan lines of business. The favorable change was also attributable to favorable inpatient utilization during 2005, particularly in the third and fourth quarters, and a flu season in the first quarter of 2005 that was not as severe as it has been in previous years. Total reported commercial medical trend (per member per month), net of buydowns, was 7.9% in 2005. Days in total medical claims liabilities decreased slightly from the prior year due primarily to faster claim receipts and continually improved processing cycle times. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to normal operating costs of First Health, which accounted for $523.7 million of the increase in selling, general and administrative expense. Additional increases include an increase in salary expense, Medicare Part D implementation costs and a full twelve months of normal operating costs of OmniCare. Salary expenses, excluding acquisitions, have increased due to annual compensation increases and additional amortization expense related to restricted shares of common stock granted in 2004 and 2005. However, Health Plan selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of continuing revenue growth and success in controlling administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization increased almost exclusively as a result of the acquisition of First Health. Depreciation expense for First Health, primarily for computer equipment and software, was $36.8 million and amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of First Health was $27.7 million. Interest expense increased as a result of the indebtedness incurred with the acquisition of First Health. Additionally, we refinanced our credit facilities during the second quarter. As a result, we wrote off $5.4 million of deferred financing costs related to the original credit facilities. Other income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio and a rise in short term rates during the year. Our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in earnings. The effective tax rate increased to 37.3% in 2005 from 36.0% in 2004 primarily as a result of the First Health acquisition and a related change in the relative mix of states with income tax provisions. Medicare Private Fee For Service Coventry submitted bids as a Medicare Private Fee For Service (PFFS) sponsor in 2006 for the 2007 benefit year. The bids are designed to provide solutions for individuals and employer group populations. Our primary distribution strategy for the Medicare PFFS program is through marketing alliances with other insurers and brokerage channels. During the third quarter of 2006, we received approval to offer PFFS products in 43 states. The PFFS plans will be marketed under the brand name of Advantra Freedom. These plans include options with pharmacy benefits or stand alone medical benefits. In addition, there are benefit plans available at a zero premium option in most states. Products will be underwritten by Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company, First Health Life and Health Insurance Company and Cambridge Life Insurance Company. We have established partnerships with Medicare Supplement insurance carriers and brokerage channels nationwide to provide Medicare Private Fee For Service to Medicare beneficiaries. 42 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a vast majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. In addition to ample current liquidity, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs. Our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA+ and an average contractual duration of 2.8 years as of December 31, 2006. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. Our cash and investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $56.4 million restricted under state regulations, increased $723.9 million to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006 from $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005. On February 8, 2007, the Company announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Concentra, Inc.s workers compensation managed care services businesses. The Company will acquire the Concentra businesses for $387.5 million in an all cash transaction expected to close in 90 to 180 days, subject to closing conditions, regulatory and other customary approvals. We anticipate the funds for payment of the acquisition will be provided by existing cash, additional bank borrowings or a new bond offering. On February 15, 2007, we redeemed all $170.5 million of our outstanding 8.125% Senior Notes. We redeemed the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 104.1% of the principal amount plus interest accrued on the redemption date. We will record a charge, including the write off of previously paid unamortized issuance costs, of approximately $9.1 million before tax, or $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. The funds for payment of the redemption price were provided by existing cash. The demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings and an increase in medical liabilities. The increase in medical liabilities was driven by the addition of approximately $363.5 million related to the Part D program. Total cash inflows from Medicare Part D totaled $348.6 million. This amount included a net receipt of claim reinsurance subsidies from CMS of approximately $234.7 million. Following the final settlement in 2007 related to the 2006 plan year, any remaining balances from reinsurance and other subsidy payments will be returned to CMS. Accounts payable and other liabilities increased primarily due to CMS risk sharing payment accruals, attributable largely to the Part D program; an increase in income taxes payable; and other normal operating activities. Accounts receivable decreased during the year as a result of strong collections. Offsetting these operating cash inflows was an increase in other receivables which was primarily a result of pharmacy rebate receivables recorded related to the Part D program. 43 Financing and Investing Activities Proceeds from the issuance of debt include indebtedness incurred in 2005 related to the acquisition of First Health, less payments made for debt issuance costs. The issuance of debt includes $500 million of new senior notes, unsecured credit facilities consisting of a $300 million five year term loan and $65 million from a revolving credit facility drawn at closing on January 28, 2005. Proceeds also include new credit facilities the Company entered into on June 30, 2005 providing for a revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $350 million, of which $117.5 million was drawn at closing, and a term loan in the principal amount of $100 million. Payments for retirement of debt include the repayment of a $200 million long term credit facility assumed from the acquisition of First Health, repayment of the $365 million original credit facilities and the $117.5 million repayment of the new revolving credit facility. The senior notes and credit facilities require compliance with specified financial ratios and contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding incurring additional debt, limiting dividends or other restricted payments, and restricting sales of assets above a certain threshold and consolidations or mergers in the context of a change of control. We have complied with all ratios and covenants under the senior notes and credit facilities. Capital expenditures in 2006 of approximately $72.6 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. Projected capital expenditures in 2007 of approximately $65 $70 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and other equipment. Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. In February 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program in an amount equal to 5% of our outstanding common stock, thus increasing our repurchase authorization by 8.1 million shares. As a part of this program, 3.0 million shares were purchased during the first quarter of 2004 at an aggregate cost of $84.6 million, no shares were purchased in 2005 and 4.6 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2006 at an aggregate cost of $256.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is 6.2 million. We intend to repurchase approximately $200 million of our shares during the first quarter of 2007 under this program. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2006, we received $297 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. 44 The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a risk based capital (RBC) policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. We have adopted an internal policy to maintain all of our regulated subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus at or above 250% of their RBC and a level of 300% in aggregate (referred to below as 300% of RBC). Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in millions, except percentage data). 2006 2005 Regulated capital and surplus $ 1,070.6 (a) $ 897.4 300% of RBC $ 666.5 (a) $ 555.3 (a) Excess capital and surplus above 300% of RBC $ 404.1 (a) $ 342.1 (a) Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC 481% (a) 485% (a) Statutory deposits $ 56.4 $ 49.4 (a) unaudited The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of net earnings partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and multiple Department of Insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our investment in an equipment leasing limited liability company, we had cash and investments of approximately $563.1 million and $347.2 million at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and earnings from our non regulated First Health business offset, in part, by the share repurchases discussed previously. Other As of December 31, 2006, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Senior notes $ 670,500 $ $ $ $ 670,500 Interest payable on senior notes 287,129 43,853 87,706 87,706 67,864 Credit Facilities 90,000 10,000 20,000 60,000 Interest payable on credit facilities 13,670 4,517 7,533 1,620 Software purchases 9,000 3,000 1,000 5,000 Operating leases 125,407 26,993 47,533 30,579 20,302 Total contractual obligations 1,195,706 88,363 163,772 184,905 758,666 Less sublease income (8,129) (1,716) (2,831) (2,146) (1,436) Net contractual obligations $ 1,187,577 $ 86,647 $ 160,941 $ 182,759 $ 757,230 Refer to Note J to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to our operating leases. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within 6 months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within 9 months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. 45 Other Disclosure Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by us, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2006 may result in the assertion of additional claims. We maintain general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that we believe are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which we maintain reserves. The professional liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through our captive subsidiary. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, we do not believe the results of such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described below, will individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are a defendant in the provider track of the In Re: Managed Care Litigation filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, Multi District Litigation (MDL), No. 1334, in the action captioned, Charles B. Shane., et al., vs. Humana, Inc., et al. This lawsuit was filed by a group of physicians as a class action against Coventry and nine other companies in the managed care industry. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), conspiracy to violate RICO and aiding and abetting a scheme to violate RICO. In addition to these federal law claims, the complaint included state law claims for breach of contract, violations of various state prompt payment laws and equitable claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court dismissed several of the state law claims and ordered all physicians who had an arbitration provision in their provider contracts to submit their direct RICO claims and their remaining state law claims to arbitration. As a consequence of this ruling, the plaintiffs who had arbitration provisions voluntarily dismissed their claims that were subject to arbitration. In its order, the trial court also held that the plaintiffs claims of (1) conspiracy to violate RICO and (2) aiding and abetting violations of RICO were not subject to arbitration. The trial court then certified various subclasses of plaintiffs with respect to these two federal law claims. Seven defendants have entered into settlement agreements with the plaintiffs, which have received final approval from the trial court. On June 16, 2006, the trial court filed an order in the Shane lawsuit which granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of Coventry. The trial court also granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of two other defendants. The plaintiffs have appealed the trial courts summary judgment order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Shane lawsuit has triggered the filing of copycat class action complaints by other health care providers such as chiropractors, podiatrists, acupuncturists and other licensed health care professionals. Each of these actions has been transferred to the MDL and have been designated as tag along actions. The court has entered an order which stays all proceedings in the tag along actions until all pre trial proceedings in the Shane action have been concluded. Although we can not predict the outcome, we believe that the Shane and the tag along actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations. Management also believes that the claims asserted in these lawsuits are without merit and the Company intends to defend its position. Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. Although the provisions of any legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term. Nevertheless, it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 46 2007 Outlook In 2007, we are expecting our total Health Plan commercial risk membership to ultimately remain approximately flat with 2006 year end results. We expect Health Plan non risk membership to be up 5% to 6% compared to 2006 year end membership. We expect Medicare Advantage (excluding PFFS) membership to grow in the range of 5% to 10% during 2007, and expect Health Plan Medicaid membership to be up over 10% for the year, the majority of which resulting from the acquisition of approximately 31,000 members in our Missouri market in February 2007. In the aggregate, we expect total Health Plan membership to be flat to slightly down in Q1 2007, including the impact of the Medicaid acquisition. For 2007, we will offer a new Medicare Advantage PFFS plan in 43 states. Through the combined efforts of our various distribution channels, we expect to generate between 90,000 to 100,000 new PFFS members during 2007 with associated revenue of approximately $700 million. Risk Factors See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Prior to the acquisition of First Health, our Investment Policy and Guidelines did not permit equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. As described in the notes to the financial statements, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health. The Board approved modifications to our investment guidelines by adopting a permitted exception to allow for such investments if, in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. We determined it would not be in our best interest to liquidate this investment and therefore the investment in the equipment leasing limited liability company was approved as a permitted exception. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Administration and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The current unrealized loss is almost exclusively the result of interest rate increases and not unfavorable changes in the credit ratings associated with these securities. These investments are not in high risk industries or sectors and we intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value, which may be maturity. See Note E to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. 47 Our investments at December 31, 2006 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair As of December 31, 2006 Cost Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 369,983 $ 369,455 1 to 5 years 380,325 377,011 5 to 10 years 262,409 262,573 Over 10 years 361,737 359,847 Total $ 1,374,454 1,368,886 Equity investment 54,078 Total short term and long term securities $ 1,422,964 Our projections of hypothetical net gains in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
