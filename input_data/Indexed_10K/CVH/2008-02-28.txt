Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows. Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Risk Factors Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in Bethesda, Maryland, operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through our Commercial Business, Individual Consumer & Government Business, and Specialty Business divisions, we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. Summary of 2007 Performance Revenue increased 27.7% over the prior year. Membership increased 13.8% over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased 14.7% over the prior year. Closed four acquisitions across all business divisions deploying $1.2 billion of capital. Operating Revenue and Products We operate health plans, insurance companies, managed care services companies, and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Managed care premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our PPO and POS products are typically lower than our HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Managed care premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, fiscal agent services (generally for state entitlement programs), claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. Operating Expenses We incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk. Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies. Drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs. 28 We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services, such as mental health care, and a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 4.9% of the Companys total medical costs for the year ended December 31, 2007. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically, cost effective appropriate services. We incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers. Both businesses were acquired with the acquisition of the workers compensation managed care services business from Concentra, Inc. (Concentra). These costs are associated with fee based products. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer. To a lesser extent, our selling, general and administration expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have not needed to use financing methods to fund operations. While we have incurred debt (as described in Note I to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K), the proceeds have been used to finance acquisitions and were not used to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions, to prepay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. 29 As of December 31, 2007, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $29.7 million compared with approximately $20.1 million at December 31, 2006. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $3.4 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for the older receivables. We also receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM who perform periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHB Program. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone response time, etc. We also enter into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per member per month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, we estimate and record performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we have experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development is a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. 30 The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively (in thousands). 2007 2006 2005 Medical liabilities, beginning of period $ 1,121,151 $ 752,774 $ 660,475 Acquisitions (1) 126,583 41,895 Reported Medical Costs Current year 7,055,596 5,570,872 4,672,009 Prior year development (135,065) (130,908) (121,138) Total reported medical costs 6,920,531 5,439,964 4,550,871 Claim Payments Payments for current year 6,134,631 4,852,359 4,030,685 Payments for prior year 586,390 542,571 469,782 Total claim payments 6,721,021 5,394,930 4,500,467 Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities (285,281) 323,343 Medical liabilities, end of period $ 1,161,963 $ 1,121,151 $ 752,774 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 2.5% 2.9% 2.9% Current year paid percent (3) 86.9% 87.3% 86.3% (1) Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year developments are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable restatements from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2007 prior year developments relate almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2006 and the increase in prior year medical cost was driven primarily by growth in the medical cost base of our Company. The Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represent subsidy amounts received from CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization and other factors. 31 Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example (in thousands, except percentages) provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2007 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase (Decrease) in Completion Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 1.0 % $ (31,750) (5.0) % $ (87,100) (1.5) % $ (2,400) 0.7 % $ (21,350) (2.5) % $ (43,550) (1.0) % $ (1,600) 0.3 % $ (10,550) (1.0) % $ (17,400) (0.5) % $ (800) (0.3) % $ 10,600 1.0 % $ 17,400 0.5 % $ 800 (0.7) % $ 21,650 2.5 % $ 43,550 1.0 % $ 1,600 (1.0) % $ 32,400 5.0 % $ 87,100 1.5 % $ 2,400 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. As noted in the table above, presenting the components of the change in medical claims liabilities, we had $135.1 million in favorable prior year developments. The significant factors driving the favorable developments include: Lower than anticipated medical cost increases $58 million Higher than expected completion factors $19 million Lower than expected inpatient hospital utilization $3 million Lower than anticipated large claim liabilities $31 million Lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities $24 million A regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and, if appropriate, the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience. Our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of December 31, 2007 by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2007. However, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Investments We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, monoline bond issuer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. 32 Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2007. For those investments, the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss State and municipal bonds $ 66,400 $ (226) $ 101,329 $ (504) $ 167,729 $ (730) US Treasury securities 1,000 (1) 1,000 (1) Government Sponsored enterprise securities 1,050 (1) 8,626 (32) 9,676 (33) Mortgage backed securities 79,929 (1,394) 91,915 (1,211) 171,844 (2,605) Asset backed securities 7,526 (120) 20,702 (563) 28,228 (683) Corporate debt and other securities 27,347 (212) 75,847 (977) 103,194 (1,189) $ 183,252 $ (1,954) $ 298,419 $ (3,287) $ 481,671 $ (5,241) The securities presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporarily impaired investment. The unrealized loss is almost exclusively the result of interest rate movements. We intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value, which may be maturity. Additionally, due primarily to long standing conservative investment guidelines, we have a de minimis sub prime investment and auction rate security exposure. With our municipal bond investments, they remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits. Although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality, $523.0 million of our $880.1 million state and municipal bond holdings are insured. For our mortgaged backed and asset backed securities, our holdings remain at investment grade with a AAA rating. We participate in only the higher level investment tranches. For our asset backed securities, we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment. Goodwill and Other Long lived Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. For our impairment analysis we relied primarily on the income approach and secondarily on the market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows, and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles. See Note C to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to intangible assets. Our remaining long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. In accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project. We periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. 33 Stock Based Compensation Expense We account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Shared Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. We believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone. Therefore, the expected volatility in 2006 and 2007 was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock based compensation. New Accounting Standards In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For a tax benefit to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities. The benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position. The Company adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The change in net assets, because of applying this pronouncement, is considered a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change required to be treated as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The cumulative effect of implementing FIN 48 was an increase of $3.4 million to the beginning balance of retained earnings. In May 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN 48 1 Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FSP FIN 48 1). FSP FIN 48 1 provides guidance on how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48 1 is effective retroactively to January 1, 2007. The implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (R), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 (R) requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date, with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. SFAS No. 141 (R) is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is prohibited. We have not yet determined the effect on our consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS No. 141 (R). Acquisitions During the three years ended December 31, 2007, we completed five business combinations and one membership purchase. These business combinations are all accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements since their effective date of acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price of our membership purchases is allocated to identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over a useful life of ten to fifteen years. 34 The following table summarizes all business combinations and membership purchases for the three years ended December 31, 2007. The purchase price of each business combination includes the payment for net worth and estimated transition costs. The purchase price, inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date and transition cost adjustments, is presented below (millions): Purchase Effective Date Market Price Business Combinations First Health Group Corp.

Provider Synergies manages preferred drug lists and negotiates rebates on behalf of state government and commercial clients. The businesses acquired from Concentra include a preferred provider organization, provider bill review, pharmacy benefit management, field case management, telephonic case management and independent medical exam businesses. The businesses acquired from Mutual include Mutuals commercial employer group health business in Nebraska and Iowa, as well as its national Federal Employees Health Benefits administration business, representing approximately 233,000 members in total. Vista is a Florida based diversified health plan serving approximately 294,000 members consisting of 150,000 commercial employer group members, 32,000 individual members, 28,000 Medicare Advantage HMO members and 84,000 state program members. Approximately 85% of the membership is in the south Florida market with the remainder in north central Florida and the states panhandle. In addition to the acquired businesses discussed above, we completed a purchase of approximately 26,500 members from FirstGuard Health Plan Missouri, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Centene Corporation. For additional information regarding our acquisitions, please refer to Note B to our consolidated financial statements. Membership The following table presents our membership as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in thousands). December 31, Membership by Product 2007 2006 Commercial group risk(1) 1,580 1,457 Health plan ASO 750 621 Other ASO(2) 783 866 Total Commercial Division 3,113 2,944 Medicare Advantage(3) 283 80 Medicare Part D 704 687 Total Medicare 987 767 Medicaid risk 480 373 Individual 93 23 Total Individual Consumer & Government Division 1,560 1,163 Total Membership 4,673 4,107 (1) Commercial Group Risk membership includes our health plan commercial group business and a small group PPO insurance block which was previously imbedded within our First Health segment. (2) Other ASO membership includes active National Accounts and FEHBP administrative services business. (3) Medicare Advantage membership includes Medicare Advantage HMO, Medicare Advantage PPO and Medicare Advantage PFFS results. 35 Commercial group risk membership increased 123,000 over the prior year end due primarily to the members acquired through the acquisition of Vista and of certain group health businesses from Mutual of Omaha, which together added 168,000 members. Health plan ASO membership increased 129,000 due to acquisitions, which added 99,000 members, and due to new sales and certain groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product. Other ASO membership declined due to losses in our National Accounts business which was partially offset by FEHBP members obtained through the group health business acquired from Mutual of Omaha. Individual Consumer & Government membership increased 397,000 from the prior year end, primarily due to our new Medicare Private Fee for Service (PFFS) product. Commencing January 1, 2007, we offered Medicare PFFS plans to individuals in 43 states under the name Advantra Freedom. The increase in membership related to PFFS was 166,000. Membership also increased from the prior year due to the members acquired through the acquisition of Vista and FirstGuard which together added 170,000 members. Additionally, we had organic growth in our Individual, Medicare Advantage HMO and PPO and our Part D businesses. Results of Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 (in thousands, except earnings per share and percentage data). Increase Increase 2007 2006 (Decrease) 2006 2005 (Decrease) Consolidated Business Total operating revenues $ 9,879,531 $ 7,733,756 27.7% $ 7,733,756 $ 6,611,246 17.0% Operating earnings $ 932,632 $ 841,003 10.9% $ 841,003 $ 791,818 6.2% Operating earnings as a % of revenue 9.4% 10.9% (1.4%) 10.9% 12.0% (1.1%) Net earnings $ 626,094 $ 560,045 11.8% $ 560,045 $ 501,639 11.6% Diluted earnings per share $ 3.98 $ 3.47 14.7% $ 3.47 $ 3.10 11.9% Selling, general and administrative 18.1% 17.3% 0.8% 17.3% 17.9% (0.6%) as a percentage of revenue Comparison of 2007 to 2006 Managed care premium revenue increased in both our Individual Consumer & Government and Commercial divisions. The growth is a result of our new Medicare PFFS product, growth in existing products as well as from the acquisitions; each of which is described above. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in same store Commercial risk membership over the prior year period. Management services revenue increased compared to the prior year as a result of the acquisition of Concentra and Mutual described above. This increase was partially offset by membership losses in our Commercial Divisions National Accounts business. Medical costs increased almost exclusively as a result of new business in both our Individual Consumer & Government Division and Commercial Division discussed above. Medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue (medical loss ratio) increased 0.3% from the prior year as a result of slightly higher medical loss ratios, associated with acquired businesses and from our new Medicare PFFS business which has a slightly higher medical loss ratio than our overall business. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to operating costs associated with our recent acquisitions of Concentra, Mutual and Vista, as well as costs related to our new Medicare PFFS business in 2007. The increase in total selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to increased salary and benefit expense as we position ourselves for future growth initiatives and as we incur normal annual compensation increases. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the expense associated with the fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired with the recent acquisitions, as well as a result of an increase in property and equipment over the past twelve months. Interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of debt during the current year, details of which are discussed below in our discussion of liquidity. The increase is also a result of the redemption during the first quarter of 2007 of our $170.5 million of outstanding 8.125% senior notes due February 15, 2012. We redeemed the notes at a redemption price equal to 104.1% of the principal amount plus interest accrued on the redemption date. As a result of the redemption, we recognized $6.9 million of interest expense for the premium paid on redemption and wrote off $2.2 million of deferred financing costs related to the senior notes. 36 Other income increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio and higher interest rates. Our provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in earnings. The effective tax rate decreased to 37.1% compared to 37.5% for the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of a change in the proportion of our earnings in states with lower tax rates. Comparison of 2006 to 2005 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of business related to our Medicare Part D products, which was new in 2006, and as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets. Medicare Part D business accounted for $669.9 million of managed care premium revenue in 2006. Commercial premium yields (premium per member per month) increased as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets. The reported commercial premium yield increase of 5.3% is lower than the rate increases on renewing business due to a mix change in the types of plans being purchased as new business (such as a change to lower benefit plans); the types of plans being selected by renewing members when they have a choice among multiple options (such as a change to higher deductible, lower premium plans); and the termination of certain large groups which had high costs and high premium yields. Medicare Advantage premium yields increased as a result of the rate increases from the annual competitive bid filings. Medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases effective January 1 and July 1, 2006 in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market. Management services revenue decreased partially as a result of declines in membership in the National Accounts and Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan businesses. Additionally, the implementation of Medicare Part D resulted in a decline of Medicaid/Public pharmacy administration fee based revenue during 2006 compared to 2005, although this decline was more than offset by the increased revenue from our new Medicare Part D business discussed above in the managed care premium revenue section. These decreases were also partially offset by reporting a full year of First Health results in 2006. First Health was acquired on January 28, 2005 and therefore only results from January 28, 2005 through December 31, 2005 are included in our 2005 results of operations. Medical costs increased as a result of new business related to our Medicare Part D products and as a result of medical trend. Medicare Part D medical costs totaled $565.9 million. Excluding Medicare Part D business, medical costs from our health plans as a percentage of premium revenue declined 0.6% in 2006 compared with 2005. The decline is primarily a result of premium increases and better than expected cost trends. The better than expected cost trends were primarily attributed to lower inpatient and outpatient utilization and the uncertainties at the prior year end regarding our Louisiana operations and the effects from Hurricane Katrina. Days in total medical claims liabilities decreased slightly from the prior year due primarily to faster claim receipts and continually improved processing cycle times. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of costs related to the new Medicare Part D business in 2006, reporting a full year of the First Health results in 2006, recognizing stock option expense related to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) and increased salary expenses due to annual compensation increases. However, these increases are partially offset by synergies gained subsequent to the acquisition of First Health. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have improved as a result of these achieved synergies, continuing revenue growth and success in controlling overall administrative costs. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of reporting a full year of First Health results in 2006 and as a result of an increase in property and equipment during 2005 and 2006, primarily computer equipment and software related to our First Health business. Interest expense was higher in 2005 as a result of the refinancing of our credit facilities during the second quarter of 2005. As a result of the refinancing, we wrote off $5.4 million of deferred financing costs in the second quarter of 2005 related to the original credit facilities associated with the First Health acquisition. Additionally, our debt has declined during 2005 and 2006 and, as a result, interest expense related to the indebtedness has also declined. Other income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio and a rise in interest rates during 2005 and 2006. Our provision for income taxes increased almost exclusively due to an increase in earnings. Our effective tax rate remained relatively flat at 37.5% in 2006 compared to 37.3% in 2005. 37 Business Segments In an effort to further integrate the First Health business acquired in January of 2005, we realigned in 2007 into new operating units, which are based on the product sold and the customer type. Our new organizational structure, effective January 1, 2007, capitalizes on existing synergies and brings enhanced focus on areas of growth opportunities. As a result of the new organizational structure, our reportable segments changed. Each of our three new segments is managed separately and separate operating results are available that are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. The Commercial Business Division is comprised of all of our commercial employer focused businesses including the traditional health plan group risk and ASO products as well as the National Accounts, FEHBP, and Network Rental businesses. The Individual Consumer & Government Division contains the individual consumer products and all Medicare and Medicaid products. The Specialty Division includes our workers compensation services businesses.

The increase was also a result of an increase in average premium yields per member per month in our commercial group risk business. Commercial premium yields increased as a result of rate increases that occurred throughout all markets. This increase was partially offset by membership declines in our same store commercial group risk business. However, a portion of those members changed from our risk products to our non risk products. Commercial management services revenue declined in 2007 due to membership losses in our national accounts non risk business, partially offset by an increase in our commercial health plan ASO membership. The gross margin decreased as a result of the decline in commercial management services revenue discussed above and the increase in the Health Plan Commercial medical loss ratio in 2007 compared to 2006. The year to year increase in the medical loss ratio is a result of the inclusion of the acquired Mutual of Omaha and Vista businesses in 2007, as well as the low medical loss ratio experienced by our Louisiana health plan in 2006, which was driven by the unique circumstances that existed in the Louisiana market at that time, the effects due to Hurricane Katrina. Individual Consumer & Government Division Individual Consumer & Government revenue increased from 2006 as a result of membership from our new Medicare PFFS business, as well as the increased Part D, Medicaid and Individual membership, both organic and acquired. Part D revenue includes adjustments attributable to the estimation of CMS risk sharing payments. Medicare Advantage risk premium yields per member per month decreased as a result of the addition of our new Medicare Private Fee For Service business, which has a lower premium yield than our existing Medicare Advantage business, since our individually distributed PFFS products generally did not include a pharmacy benefit in 2007. This average premium yield decrease was partially offset by the rate increases from the annual competitive bid filings for our Medicare Advantage products, as well as from increases in risk factor adjustment scores for certain of our Medicare products. Part D premium yields have declined in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the lower CMS risk sharing accruals as well as the annual competitive bid filings for our Part D products. This change is a result of the improved profitability of the Part D program, which is discussed below. Medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, effective July 1, 2006 and July 1, 2007. The increase in gross margin was driven by the increased business discussed above and was partially offset by the increased medical costs associated with this increased business. Part D medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue have decreased over the prior year quarter as a result of favorable pharmacy cost trend due to re negotiated pharmaceutical contracts resulting from higher enrollment and as a result of members moving to generic drugs. Medicaid medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue increased over the prior year as a result of an increase in large claims incurred in our Missouri market. Specialty Division Specialty revenue and operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Concentra during the second quarter of 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. In addition to ample current liquidity, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs. Our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. Our fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA+ and an average contractual duration of 3.6 years as of December 31, 2007. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. 39 Our cash and investments, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $64.4 million restricted under state regulations, increased $57.5 million to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007 from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006. The demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities is primarily driven by net earnings and by an increase in medical liabilities of approximately $194.8 million related to the new Medicare PFFS business. The nature of Medicare PFFS is such that premium revenues are generally received up to two months prior to the cash payment for the related medical costs. Accordingly, this results in strong cash inflows upon the implementation of a new benefit program. These inflows are partially offset by the $363.7 million payment to CMS, which was expected, related to the 2006 Medicare Part D contract year which was the primary driver for the decrease in medical claims liabilities, and other accrued liabilities. The decrease in cash flows from other receivables was primarily a result of an increase in pharmacy rebate receivables related to the Medicare Part D business and the CMS payment previously mentioned. Additionally, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to a decrease in income taxes payable, attributable largely to tax payments for the year exceeding the tax provision, offset by other normal operating activities. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in 2007 of approximately $61.3 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. Projected capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately $65 $75 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and other equipment. During 2007, we made acquisitions for a total cost of approximately $1.2 billion, net of cash acquired, which was paid in cash, including $34.2 million paid into an escrow account pending final settlement. Financing Activities Proceeds from the issuance of debt include approximately $789.1 million of new Senior Notes, net of any discounts and payments made for debt issuance costs. These proceeds also include an amended and restated credit agreement providing for an $850 million credit facility, of which $365.0 million was drawn in 2007. In addition to cash on hand, the proceeds were partially used to retire both the $170.5 million of 2002 Senior Notes and our $90 million term loan, which included a $10 million scheduled repayment, and to fund the previously mentioned acquisitions. The details of these transactions are as follows: On February 15, 2007, we redeemed all $170.5 million of our remaining outstanding 8.125% Senior Notes due February 15, 2012. We redeemed the notes at a redemption price equal to 104.1% of the principal amount plus interest accrued on the redemption date. As a result of the redemption, we recognized $6.9 million of interest expense for the premium paid on redemption and wrote off $2.2 million of deferred financing costs related to these Senior Notes. The funds for payment of the redemption price were provided by cash on hand. On March 20, 2007, we completed the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.95% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017 (the 10 year Notes) at the issue price of 99.63% per Note. The 10 year Notes were offered and we sold pursuant to its automatic shelf registration statement and are now registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value was $390.5 million. On July 11, 2007, we executed an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility provides for a five year revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $850.0 million, with us having the ability to request an increase in the facility amount up to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.0 billion. The obligations under the Credit Facility are our general unsecured obligations. We drew $80.0 million under the Credit Facility to pay off our remaining $80.0 million balance on our five year term loan that was originally entered into during 2005 and drew an additional $285.0 million to help fund the Vista acquisition payment. 40 On August 27, 2007, we completed the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.30% Senior Notes due 2014 (the 7 year Notes) at the issue price of 99.575% per Note. The 7 year Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2007, the fair value was $410.0 million. Our senior notes dated January 28, 2005 and credit facilities require compliance with a leverage ratio. All of our senior notes and credit facility contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding additional debt, dividends or other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, disposing of assets and in some cases provide for debt repayment upon consolidations or mergers. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the senior notes and credit facility. Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. In February 2007, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program of 7.9 million shares. As a part of this program, no shares were purchased in 2005, 4.6 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2006 at an aggregate cost of $256.1 million and 7.5 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2007 at an aggregate cost of $429.0 million. As of December 31, 2007, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is 6.5 million. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2007, we received $421.6 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and paid $71.9 million in capital contributions. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. The State of Florida does not currently use RBC methodology in its regulation of HMOs. Some states, in which our regulated subsidiaries operate, require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 (in millions, except percentage data). 2007 2006 (unaudited) Regulated capital and surplus $ 1,224.1 $ 1,055.3 200% of RBC (a) $ 573.6 (b) $ 424.2 Excess capital and surplus above 200% of RBC (a) $ 650.5 (b) $ 631.1 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC (a) 429% (b) 498% Statutory deposits $ 64.4 $ 56.4 (a) Unaudited (b) As mentioned above, the State of Florida does not have a RBC requirement for its regulated HMOs. Accordingly, the statutory reserve information provided, for Vista, is based on the actual statutory minimum capital required by the State of Florida. The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of net earnings as well as the inclusion of the Vista and Mutual of Omaha acquisitions. This was partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations. 41 Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments, we had cash and investments of approximately $436.2 million and $563.1 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to payments made for the Concentra, Mutual of Omaha and Vista acquisitions and payments for share repurchases. These payments were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our Senior Notes, dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries, and additional borrowings on our credit facility. Other As of December 31, 2007, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Senior notes $ 1,300,000 $ $ $ 250,000 $ 1,050,000 Interest payable on senior notes 605,823 82,441 164,882 157,538 200,962 Credit Facilities 365,000 365,000 Interest payable on credit facilities (a) 80,788 17,877 35,656 27,255 Software purchases 9,200 500 8,700 Operating leases 157,200 39,707 59,045 39,012 19,436 Total contractual obligations 2,518,011 140,525 268,283 838,805 1,270,398 Less sublease income (9,612) (2,860) (3,997) (2,392) (363) Net contractual obligations $ 2,508,399 $ 137,665 $ 264,286 $ 836,413 $ 1,270,035 (a) Interest payable on credit facities has been estimated based on interest rates as of February 2008 and assumes no additional changes in the principal amount. Refer to Note J to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to our operating leases. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. As of December 31, 2007, we had $83.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments. See note G to the consolidated financials statements for additional information. Other Disclosure Legal Proceedings See Legal Proceedings in Note J, Commitments and Contingencies which is incorporated herein by reference. Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. Although the provisions of any future legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term. Nevertheless, it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations. 42 Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations, in which we assume underwriting risk, we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2008 Outlook Given the results of sales activity through February, 2008, we expect to add 100,000 net Medicare Advantage members during 2008 from both individual and group sales. We expect to add at least 125,000 net Part D members from our 2007 year end results. A majority of these new members will be in Low Income Subsidy products. As a result of this growth and the overall programs wider risk sharing corridor in 2008, our Part D business is expected to have a steeper medical loss ratio (MLR) slope, resulting in a greater seasonal effect on the progression of quarterly earnings per share. More specifically, in the fourth quarter of 2007, we reported a Part D MLR of 58%. For the first quarter of 2008, we are expecting a loss ratio of 104% (vs. a 95% and 98% MLR in the first quarter of 2007 and 2006, respectively). Despite the better than previously expected membership growth and quarterly MLR progression referred to above, our expectations of the full year Part D MLR have not changed. We expect to grow our commercial risk membership 1% to 2% for the full year. As with the first quarter of 2007, we expect that our commercial risk membership will decrease in the first quarter of 2008. However, based on our strong underlying small group results, and the large group pipeline, we expect membership to grow in each of the remaining quarters. Regarding the MLR for our same store commercial group business, we expect it to remain relatively flat in 2008 at approximately 78%, with the expected 2008 reported commercial group MLR, including the annualization impact of 2007 acquisitions, to be in the mid to high 78%s. We expect individual membership to grow to 150,000 members by the end of 2008. This would essentially double our non Vista organic membership from our 2007 results. We expect investment income to decrease in 2008 due to lower market interest rates. Regarding use of cash, we remain committed to share repurchase as well as evaluating acquisition opportunities. We closed on an acquisition of a small behavioral health company during February 2008. This acquisition will have an immaterial effect on our consolidated revenue and results for the year. We expect to gain the benefits of in sourcing our behavioral health business in all of our markets over the next several years. We are also pursuing a range of solutions for both group life and dental products, and expect to move forward in these areas in 2008 as well. Any effect of these initiatives on revenue or earnings for 2008 is expected to be immaterial. Risk Factors See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Our Investment Policy and Guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. Our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and if, in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. As described in the notes to the financial statements, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health and in an insurance agency through our acquisition of Vista. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. 43 We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Administration and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, monoline bond insurer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. The current unrealized loss is almost exclusively the result of interest rate movements. We intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value, which may be maturity. See Note E to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. Our investments at December 31, 2007 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair As of December 31, 2007 Cost Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 196,558 $ 196,205 1 to 5 years 478,454 482,676 5 to 10 years 414,970 419,658 Over 10 years 757,533 759,943 Total $ 1,847,515 1,858,482 Equity investments 55,220 Total short term and long term securities $ 1,913,702 Our projections of hypothetical net gains in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
