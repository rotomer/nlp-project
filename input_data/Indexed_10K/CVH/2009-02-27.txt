Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows. Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Risk Factors Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in Bethesda, Maryland, operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through our Commercial Business, Individual Consumer & Government Business, and Specialty Business divisions, we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. Summary of 2008 Performance Managed care premium revenues increased 21.6% from the prior year Management services revenues increased 13.5% from the prior year Medicare Advantage growth of 97,000 members from the prior year, an increase of 34% Medicare Part D growth of 227,000 members from the prior year, an increase of 32% GAAP cash flows from operations were $627.4 million, or 164% of net earnings Operating earnings as a percentage of revenues were 5.2%, compared to 9.4% in the prior year Net earnings were $381.9 million, a decline of 39% from 2007, net earnings 20 Operating Revenue and Products We operate health plans, insurance companies, managed care services companies, and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Managed care premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our PPO and POS products are typically lower than our HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Managed care premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in selected markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. Operating Expenses We incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk. Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies. Drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs. We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services, such as mental health care, and a small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 4.1% of the Companys total medical costs for the year ended December 31, 2008. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically, cost effective appropriate services. We incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers. These costs are associated with fee based products. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer. To a lesser extent, our selling, general and administration expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have generally not needed to use external financing to fund operations. While we have incurred debt (as described in Note J, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K), the proceeds have primarily been used to finance acquisitions. On October 3, 2008, the Company drew down $543.5 million from its Revolving Credit Facility and repaid $103.5 million of this amount on October 10, 2008. The remaining $440.0 million will be used to optimize the Companys liquidity position during the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and for general corporate purposes. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions, to prepay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments for two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. 21 Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2008, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $35.0 million compared with approximately $29.7 million at December 31, 2007. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $11.0 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for older receivables. We receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership to provide healthcare benefits to our Medicare members. Premiums are fixed (subject to retroactive risk adjustment) on an annual basis by contracts with CMS. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. CMS uses a risk adjustment model to determine premium payments to health plans. This risk adjustment model apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity based on diagnosis data provided to CMS. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based on the diagnosis data submitted to CMS. Changes in revenue from CMS resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustments scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM who perform periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone response time, etc. We also enter into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per member per month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, we estimate and record performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development has been a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. 22 The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively (in thousands). 2008 2007 2006 Medical liabilities, beginning of year $ 1,161,963 $ 1,121,151 $ 752,774 Acquisitions (1) 7,590 126,583 Reported Medical Costs Current year 8,916,644 7,055,596 5,570,872 Prior year development (48,065) (135,065) (130,908) Total reported medical costs 8,868,579 6,920,531 5,439,964 Claim Payments Payments for current year 7,577,939 6,134,631 4,852,359 Payments for prior year 1,013,216 586,390 542,571 Total claim payments 8,591,155 6,721,021 5,394,930 Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities (586) (285,281) 323,343 Medical liabilities, end of year $ 1,446,391 $ 1,161,963 $ 1,121,151 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 0.7% 2.5% 2.9% Current year paid percent (3) 85.0% 86.9% 87.1% (1) Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2008 prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2007. The significant favorable / (unfavorable) factors driving the overall favorable prior year developments include: Lower than anticipated medical cost increases of $47.6 million favorable development Lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of $28.4 million favorable development Lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of $10.5 million favorable development Lower than expected completion factors of ($27.1) million unfavorable development Higher than expected inpatient hospital utilization of ($10.0) million unfavorable development Higher than anticipated membership of ($1.3) million unfavorable development The increase in total reported medical cost from 2007 to 2008 was driven primarily by growth in the medical cost base of the Company. A secondary driver of the medical cost growth was the change in prior year development. Prior year development experienced in 2008 was less favorable compared to amounts experienced in 2007. The lower favorable development is primarily attributable to our PFFS line of business. PFFS experienced an unfavorable development due to lower than expected completion factors. The Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represent subsidy amounts received from CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization and other factors. 23 Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example (in thousands, except percentages) provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2008 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase (Decrease) in Completion Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 1.0 % $ (62,385) (4.0) % $ (84,502) (1.5) % $ (2,741) 0.7 % $ (41,939) (2.5) % $ (52,814) (1.0) % $ (1,827) 0.3 % $ (20,728) (1.0) % $ (21,126) (0.5) % $ (914) (0.3) % $ 20,870 1.0 % $ 21,126 0.5 % $ 914 (0.7) % $ 42,521 2.5 % $ 52,814 1.0 % $ 1,827 (1.0) % $ 63,682 4.0 % $ 84,502 1.5 % $ 2,741 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. A regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and if appropriate, the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience. Our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of December 31, 2008 by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2008. However, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Investments We account for investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, monoline bond insurer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the impairment is included in net earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. We use prices from independent pricing services and, to a lesser extent, indicative (non binding) quotes from independent brokers, to measure the fair value of our investment securities. We utilize multiple independent pricing services and brokers to obtain fair values; however, we generally obtain one price/quote for each individual security. We perform an analysis on market liquidity and other market related conditions to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. Examples of the procedures performed include, but are not limited to, an on going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different price sources for reasonableness. We monitor pricing inputs to determine if the markets from which the data is gathered are active. As further validation, we sample a securitys past fair value estimates and compare the valuations to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data, which happens infrequently, the price of the security is adjusted accordingly. Generally, we do not adjust prices received from pricing services or brokers, unless it is evident from our verification procedures the fair value measurement is not consistent with SFAS No. 157. Based upon our internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services, we have concluded that the fair values provided by pricing services and brokers are consistent with the guidance in SFAS No. 157. 24 During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized a charge of $36.2 million that consisted of $33.5 million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities and $2.7 million in realized losses on the sale of securities. The other than temporary impairment charge related to its investments in Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman), certain corporate financial holdings, auction rate securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities. We recognized impairments related to 31 securities during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our investments in Lehman included fixed maturity securities with a cost basis of $8.7 million. On September 15, 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, any recovery of our investments in Lehman is deemed remote and therefore an other than temporary impairment of $8.7 million was recognized. Additionally, other than temporary impairments recognized during the year ended 2008 included charges for certain fixed maturity securities, auction rate securities and mortgage and asset backed securities for which, due to credit downgrades and or the extent and duration of their decline in fair value in light of the current market conditions, we determined that the impairment was deemed other than temporary. Any potential recovery of the fair value of these securities is not expected in the near term and therefore we no longer anticipate holding these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. These facts led us to conclude that these investment securities were other than temporarily impaired. The following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2008. For these investments, the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss Fair Value Unrealized Loss State and municipal bonds $ 154,665 $ (3,052) $ 21,441 $ (1,494) $ 176,106 $ (4,546) US Treasury securities 274,891 (54) 274,891 (54) Mortgage backed securities 53,441 (4,525) 27,815 (5,956) 81,256 (10,481) Asset backed securities 46,508 (2,413) 9,135 (4,483) 55,643 (6,896) Corporate debt and other securities 78,730 (1,450) 4,063 (1,363) 82,793 (2,813) $ 608,235 $ (11,494) $ 62,454 $ (13,296) $ 670,689 $ (24,790) The unrealized losses presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporary impairment. The unrealized losses are the result of interest rate movements and significant increases in volatility and liquidity concerns in the securities and credit markets. We intend to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in market value, which may be maturity. Our municipal bond investments remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits (excluding monoline insurers). Although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality, $498.6 million of our $841.3 million total state and municipal bond holdings are insured through a monoline insurer. For our mortgaged backed and asset backed securities, our holdings remain at investment grade with a AAA rating. We participate in only the higher level investment tranches. For our asset backed securities, we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment. Goodwill and Other Long lived Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We performed a goodwill impairment analysis, at the reporting unit level, as of October 1, our annual impairment test date. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if there is any indication of a potential impairment. Those indications may include experiencing disruptions to business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. For our impairment analysis we relied on both the income approach and the market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by comparing our Company to similar publicly traded entities and also by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. In the case of a publicly traded company, the objective of the market capitalization approach is to determine whether the quoted market price is indicative of the fair value of its reporting units. In addressing the relationship of the determined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, we considered factors outlined in SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, including: the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties; quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement, if available; the market price of an individual equity security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole; and the quoted market price of an individual equity security, therefore, need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit. Subsequent to our 2008 annual impairment test, we experienced a decline in the market capitalization of our Company to an amount below book value. As a result, we reconsidered our analysis, incorporating new information that became available after the annual impairment date. This new information included operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 as well as revised expectations for fiscal year 2009. 25 While we considered the market capitalization decline in our evaluation of fair value of goodwill, we concluded that it did not impact the overall goodwill impairment analysis as we believe the decline to be primarily attributed to the negative market conditions as a result of the credit crisis, the economic recession and current pricing and or medical trend issues within the managed care industry. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and managed care industry events. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to goodwill. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have chosen October 1 as our impairment testing date. Our only intangible asset that is not subject to amortization consists of a trade name. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, we review intangible assets that are subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Our intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of our customer lists, licenses, and provider networks. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to our other intangible assets. See Note D, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to these assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, we periodically review long lived assets for recoverability whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. Our other long lived assets consist of property and equipment which are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. In accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 98 1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to our long lived assets. See Note E, Property and Equipment, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to these assets. Stock Based Compensation Expense We account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. We believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone. Therefore, the expected volatility was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note G, Stock Based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock based compensation.

Commercial group risk membership decreased 103,000 due to terminations and due to certain groups changing from a risk product to a non risk product. Health plan ASO membership decreased 36,000 primarily due to the loss of a large group in our Utah market partially offset by a shift of certain groups from a risk product to a non risk product. Other ASO membership decreased 150,000 due to losses of National Accounts business. Individual Consumer & Government membership increased 244,000 from the prior year end, primarily due to organic growth in all Medicare products and expansion into new areas. Medicaid risk membership decreased 109,000 primarily due to the termination of our Pennsylvania Medicaid behavioral health contract representing approximately 107,000 members, effective July 1, 2008. This was a capitated pass through arrangement we had with a local provider group. Given the nature of this globally capitated contract, we earned a low single digit operating margin. Results of Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a more meaningful discussion regarding the comparison of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 (in thousands, except earnings per share and percentage data). Increase Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) 2007 2006 (Decrease) Consolidated Business Total operating revenues $ 11,913,646 $ 9,879,531 20.6% $ 9,879,531 $ 7,733,756 27.7% Operating earnings $ 619,329 $ 932,632 (33.6%) $ 932,632 $ 841,003 10.9% Operating earnings as a % of revenue 5.2% 9.4% (4.2%) 9.4% 10.9% (1.5%) Net earnings $ 381,895 $ 626,094 (39.0%) $ 626,094 $ 560,045 11.8% Diluted earnings per share $ 2.54 $ 3.98 (36.2%) $ 3.98 $ 3.47 14.7% Selling, general and administrative 17.5% 18.1% (0.6%) 18.1% 17.3% 0.8% as a percentage of revenue Comparison of 2008 to 2007 Managed care premium revenue increased in both our Individual Consumer & Government and Commercial Divisions. The increase is a result of growth in existing products as well as from our acquisitions during 2007 of Vista Health Plans (Vista) and Mutual of Omaha (Mutual). The increase was partially offset by a decline in same store Commercial risk membership over the prior year. Management services revenue increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition of Concentra, Inc. (Concentra) and organic growth in our workers compensation services business. This increase was partially offset by the Other ASO membership decline described above. Medical costs increased as a result of new business in both our Individual Consumer & Government and Commercial Divisions discussed above. Medical cost also increased due to increased Commercial and Medicare PFFS medical cost trend as well as unfavorable IBNR reserve development on our Medicare PFFS business. The Medicare Part D medical loss ratio increase was a result of the premium rate changes from the annual competitive bid filings for our Medicare part D products and growth in our low income auto assign population in 2008. 27 Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to normal operating costs associated with our prior year acquisitions of Concentra, Mutual and Vista, as well as costs related to growth of our Medicare business. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily increased as a result of the expense associated with the identifiable intangible assets identified with our recent acquisitions. Interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of debt during the prior year and due to interest expense incurred on the net draw down of $440.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility in October 2008. The increase was partially offset by the redemption during the first quarter of 2007 of our $170.5 million of outstanding 8.125% senior notes due February 15, 2012. Associated with this redemption, we recognized $9.1 million of interest expense in the prior year first quarter for both the premium paid on redemption as well as the write off of associated deferred financing costs. Other income decreased due to a charge of $36.2 million that consisted of $33.5 million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities and $2.7 million in realized losses on the sale of securities. The decrease also resulted from lower interest rates during 2008. The effective tax rate was essentially flat at 37.0%, as compared to 37.1% for the prior year. Comparison of 2007 to 2006 Managed care premium revenue increased in both our Individual Consumer & Government and Commercial divisions. The growth was a result of our new PFFS product, growth in existing products as well as from the acquisitions; each of which is described above. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in same store Commercial risk membership over the prior year period. Management services revenue increased compared to the prior year as a result of the acquisition of Concentra and Mutual described above. This increase was partially offset by membership losses in our Commercial Divisions National Accounts business. Medical costs increased almost exclusively as a result of new business in both our Individual Consumer & Government Division and Commercial Division discussed above. Medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue (medical loss ratio) increased 0.3% from the prior year as a result of slightly higher medical loss ratios, associated with acquired businesses and from our new Medicare PFFS business which has a slightly higher medical loss ratio than our overall business. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to operating costs associated with our acquisitions of Concentra, Mutual and Vista, as well as costs related to our new Medicare PFFS business in 2007. The increase in total selling, general and administrative expense was also attributable to increased salary and benefit expense as we position ourselves for future growth initiatives and as we incur normal annual compensation increases. Depreciation and amortization increased as a result of the expense associated with the fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired with the recent acquisitions, as well as a result of an increase in property and equipment over the past twelve months. Interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of debt during the current year, details of which are discussed below in our discussion of liquidity. The increase is also a result of the redemption during the first quarter of 2007 of our $170.5 million of outstanding 8.125% senior notes due February 15, 2012. We redeemed the notes at a redemption price equal to 104.1% of the principal amount plus interest accrued on the redemption date. As a result of the redemption, we recognized $6.9 million of interest expense for the premium paid on redemption and wrote off $2.2 million of deferred financing costs related to the senior notes. Other income, net increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio and higher interest rates. Our provision for income taxes increased due to an increase in earnings. The effective tax rate decreased to 37.1% compared to 37.5% for the same period in 2006 primarily as a result of a change in the proportion of our earnings in states with lower tax rates. Business Segments We have three reportable segments: Commercial, Individual Consumer & Government, and Specialty. Each of these segments, which the Company also refers to as Divisions, is separately managed and provides separate operating results that are evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. Beginning in 2008, in order to reflect a change in the manner in which we manage our operations, our network rental business operations were reclassified from our Commercial Division to our Specialty Division. Our network rental business results for the 2007 period have been reclassified to conform to the 2008 presentation. The Commercial Division is comprised of all of our commercial employer focused businesses, including the traditional health plan group risk and ASO products as well as the National Accounts and FEHBP. The Individual Consumer & Government Division contains our individual consumer products and all Medicare and Medicaid products. The Specialty Division includes our workers compensation services businesses, network rental business, mental behavioral health benefits business of MHNet and the dental benefits business of GDS. Operating Revenues (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Increase Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) 2007 2006 (Decrease) Commercial group risk premiums $ 5,169,773 $ 4,785,095 $ 384,678 $ 4,785,095 $ 4,580,165 $ 204,930 Commercial ASO 351,699 410,071 (58,372) 410,071 418,304 (8,233) Total Commercial Division 5,521,472 5,195,166 326,306 5,195,166 4,998,469 196,697 Medicare risk premiums 4,024,946 2,871,605 1,153,341 2,871,605 1,484,548 1,387,057 Medicaid risk premiums 1,087,189 928,259 158,930 928,259 762,093 166,166 Individual risk premiums 234,792 104,674 130,118 104,674 30,495 74,179 Medicaid ASO 179,526 185,490 (5,964) 185,490 184,503 987 Total Individual Consumer & Govt Division 5,526,453 4,090,028 1,436,425 4,090,028 2,461,639 1,628,389 Total Specialty Division 909,086 599,940 309,146 599,940 280,209 319,731 Eliminations (43,365) (5,603) (37,762) (5,603) (6,561) 958 Total Operating Revenues $11,913,646 $ 9,879,531 $2,034,115 $ 9,879,531 $ 7,733,756 $2,145,775 28 Gross Margin (in thousands) Years Ended December 31, Increase Years Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) 2007 2006 (Decrease) Commercial Division $ 1,288,212 $ 1,445,201 $ (156,989) $ 1,445,201 $ 1,439,999 $ 5,202 Individual Consumer & Govt Division 909,951 918,361 (8,410) 918,361 577,491 340,870 Specialty Division 660,507 506,132 154,375 506,132 280,209 225,923 Eliminations (9,203) (4,502) (4,701) (4,502) (3,907) (595) Total $ 2,849,467 $ 2,865,192 $ (15,725) $ 2,865,192 $ 2,293,792 $ 571,400 Revenue and Medical Cost Statistics Year Ended December 31, Increase Year Ended December 31, Increase 2008 2007 (Decrease) 2007 2006 (Decrease) Managed Care Premium Yields (per member per month): Health plan commercial risk $ 286.30 $ 273.76 4.6% $ 273.76 $ 260.69 5.0% Medicare Advantage risk (1) $ 862.60 $ 837.69 3.0% $ 837.69 $ 857.28 (2.3%) Medicare Part D (2) $ 88.34 $ 99.57 (11.3%) $ 99.57 $ 103.77 (4.0%) Medicaid risk $ 208.50 $ 183.77 13.5% $ 183.77 $ 167.30 9.8% Individual $ 177.84 $ 167.57 6.1% $ 167.57 $ 156.33 7.2% Medical Loss Ratios: Health plan commercial risk (1) (2) 81.7% 78.3% 3.4% 78.3% 77.8% 0.5% Medicare Advantage risk 89.0% 80.5% 8.5% 80.5% 79.4% 1.1% Medicare Part D 84.1% 78.1% 6.0% 78.1% 84.5% (6.4%) Medicaid risk 85.3% 87.3% (2.0%) 87.3% 85.6% 1.7% Individual 62.9% 63.4% (0.5%) 63.4% 62.0% 1.4% (1) Revenue PMPM excludes the impact of revenue ceded to external parties. (2) Revenue PMPM excludes the impact of CMS risk share adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties. Comparison of 2008 to 2007 Commercial Division Commercial group risk premium revenue increased as a result of the acquisitions of Mutual and Vista in 2007. To a lesser extent the increase was a result of an increase in average realized premium yields per member per month in our commercial group risk business, resulting from renewal rate increases net of benefit buy downs on renewing groups and the mix of new group business net of terminated groups. This increase in premium revenue was partially offset by membership declines in our same store commercial group risk business. However, a portion of those members changed from our risk products to our non risk products. Commercial ASO revenue declined from the prior year due to membership losses in our National Accounts non risk business as well as due to fee negotiations related to the long term renewal of our contract as plan administrator of the Mail Handlers Benefit Plan. These declines were partially offset by an increase in our Commercial health plan ASO revenue. Gross margin decreased during the year as a result of the increase in the Commercial health plan medical loss ratio in 2008 and the decline in Commercial management services revenue discussed above. The decrease was partially offset by the gross margin derived from the acquisitions discussed above. Individual Consumer & Government Division Individual Consumer & Government Division revenue increased as a result of membership growth from our Medicare Advantage business, as well as increased Medicare Part D and Individual membership, both organic and acquired. Medicare Advantage risk premium yields, excluding the impact of revenue ceded to external parties, per member per month increased as a result of the rate increases from the annual competitive bid filings for our Medicare Advantage products as well as from increases in risk factor adjustment scores for our Medicare Advantage products. With the impact of the ceded revenue being included in the premium yield, the Medicare Advantage risk premium yields, per member per month decreased to $742.07 in 2008 compared to $771.81 in 2007. The decrease was a result of a larger portion of our Medicare PFFS business in 2008 being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements. This average premium yield decrease was partially offset by the annual competitive bid filings and risk factor scores noted above. Part D premium yields, excluding the impact of CMS risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties, were $88.34 in 2008 compared to $99.57 in 2007 primarily due to the annual competitive bid filings for our Part D products as well as the mix of products sold. Including the impact of the CMS risk sharing premium adjustments as well as the ceded revenue, the yields were $78.84 in 2008 compared to $82.53 in 2007. When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Advantage and Part D business, adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. When reviewing the Medicare Part D business, adjusting for the risk share amounts is useful to understand the results of the Part D business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue will eventually be insignificant on a full year basis. Medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, effective July 1, 2007 and July 1, 2008. The yields also increased due to the termination of our Pennsylvania Medicaid behavioral health contract, which had a lower premium yield. 29 The decrease in gross margin in our Individual Consumer & Government Division was driven by lower gross margins in our Medicare PFFS business as a result of increased medical costs in 2008. This decrease was partially offset by growth from our Medicare Advantage HMO and PPO business, as well as increased Medicaid and Individual business, both organic and acquired. Medicare Part D medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue have increased as a result of a widening of the risk corridors and growth in our low income auto assign population in 2008. Medicaid medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue decreased over the prior year period as a result of the premium yield increases discussed above. Specialty Division Specialty Division revenue increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of certain business from Concentra during the second quarter of 2007, as well as organic growth in our workers compensation services business. The increase was also a result of the acquisition of MHNet in the first quarter of 2008 and to a lesser extent the acquisition of GDS in the second quarter of 2008. Specialty Division gross margin increased during the current year as a result of the revenue increases discussed above partially offset by an increase in medical costs attributable to MHNet and GDS and costs of sales associated with the revenue growth in workers compensation services. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately one to two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. In addition to ample current liquidity, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs including satisfaction of policy holder benefits. Our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. Our fixed income portfolio has an average quality rating of AA+ and a modified duration of 3.3 years as of December 31, 2008. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. Our cash and investments, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $66.5 million restricted under state regulations, increased $309.7 million to $3.1 billion at December 31, 2008 from $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. The demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, was a result of net earnings and an increase in both medical liabilities and deferred revenue, partially offset by an increase in other receivables and a decrease in other payables. The increase in medical liabilities during 2008, as discussed herein, primarily related to our Medicare PFFS business and resulted from an increase in medical costs as well as from growth in that business. Other receivables increased primarily due to an increase in pharmacy rebate receivables and also due to an increase in the receivables related to the CMS program. Other payables decreased due to the payout in 2008 of 2007 incentive compensation accruals without a comparable accrual in 2008. Our net cash from operating activities in 2008 was $47.3 million higher than 2007. Contributing to this was a larger increase in medical liabilities in 2008 than in 2007 due to the reasons described above but also due to the growth in our Medicare PFFS business in 2008. The nature of our business is such that premium revenues are generally received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for the related medical costs. This results in strong cash inflows upon the implementation of a benefit program. The increase in medical liabilities was partially offset by a decline in net earnings in 2008 compared to 2007 and a larger increase in other receivables during 2008, primarily related to pharmacy rebate and Medicare accruals. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately $69.4 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. Projected capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately $65 $75 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and other equipment. During 2008, we made acquisitions for a total cost of approximately $137.4 million, net of cash acquired, which was paid in cash. Financing Activities The details of our debt transactions are as follows: During November and December 2008, we repurchased a total of $10.0 million of our remaining outstanding 5.95% Senior Notes due March 15, 2017. On October 3, 2008, we drew down $543.5 million from our Revolving Credit Facility and repaid $103.5 million of this amount on October 10, 2008. The remaining $440.0 million will be used to optimize our liquidity position during the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and potentially for general corporate purposes. Also, a few times during 2008 we drew down and repaid certain amounts on our Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. 30 Our credit facilities require compliance with a leverage ratio. All of our senior notes and credit facility contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding additional debt, dividends or other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, disposing of assets and in some cases provide for debt repayment upon consolidations or mergers. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the senior notes and credit facility. Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. In May 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved an increase to the share repurchase program in an amount equal to 5% of the Companys then outstanding common stock, thus increasing the Companys repurchase authorization by 7.5 million shares. As a part of this program, 4.6 million shares were purchased in 2006 at an aggregate cost of $256.1 million, 7.5 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2007 at an aggregate cost of $429.0 million and 7.3 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2008 at an aggregate cost of $318.0 million. As of December 31, 2008, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is 6.7 million. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2008, we received $332.1 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and infused $225.2 million in capital contributions into our subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that, if adopted, would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. The State of Florida does not currently use RBC methodology in its regulation of HMOs. Some states, in which our regulated subsidiaries operate, require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (in millions, except percentage data). 2008 2007 (unaudited) Regulated capital and surplus $ 1,299.4 $ 1,209.6 200% of RBC (a,b) $ 657.7 $ 562.2 Excess capital and surplus above 200% of RBC (a,b) $ 641.7 $ 647.4 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC (a,b) 395% 430% Statutory deposits $ 66.5 $ 64.4 (a) Unaudited (b) As mentioned above, the State of Florida does not have a RBC requirement for its regulated HMOs. Accordingly, the statutory reserve information provided for Vista is based on the actual statutory minimum capital required by the State of Florida. The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries is a result of net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company, partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments, we had cash and investments of approximately $549.9 million and $436.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase was primarily due to dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and additional borrowings on our credit facility. These were partially offset by payments for MHNet and GDS acquisitions, capital infusions into our subsidiaries, and payments made for share repurchases. 31 Other As of December 31, 2008, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments within the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 years Senior notes $ 1,290,000 $ $ $ 250,000 $ 1,040,000 Interest payable on senior notes 499,397 78,160 156,320 197,761 67,156 Credit facilities 615,029 615,029 Interest payable on credit facilities (a) 106,474 30,173 60,346 15,955 Software purchases 8,700 8,700 Operating leases 158,878 37,921 58,979 35,192 26,786 Total contractual obligations 2,678,478 154,954 275,645 1,113,937 1,133,942 Less sublease income (10,272) (2,885) (3,741) (2,252) (1,394) Net contractual obligations $ 2,668,206 $ 152,069 $ 271,904 $ 1,111,685 $ 1,132,548 (a) Interest payable on credit facilities has been estimated based on interest rates as of February 2009 and assumes no additional changes in the principal amount. Refer to Note K, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our operating leases. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. As of December 31, 2008, we had $51.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments. Other Disclosures Legal Proceedings Refer to Legal Proceedings in Note K, Commitments and Contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference. Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. Although the provisions of any future legislation adopted at the state or federal level can not be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term. Nevertheless, it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations, in which we assume underwriting risk, we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We can not be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2009 Outlook We expect to add in excess of 75,000 net Medicare Advantage members during 2009 from both individual and group sales. We expect to add in excess of 420,000 net Part D members compared to our 2008 year end membership. A majority of these new members will be in our Advantra Rx Mainstream products. We expect our Health Plan Commercial Group Risk membership to decline 4% as of January 1, 2009, and 6% to 8% for the full year. We expect the corresponding medical loss ratio for Health Plan Commercial Group Risk to be between 82.5% and 83.0% for the year. We expect to remain conservatively invested in high quality securities, with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and treasury securities as of the beginning of the year. Accordingly, given the current interest rate environment, we expect investment income to decrease in 2009. Regarding the use of cash, our first priority will be supporting the regulatory capital needs of our subsidiaries and maintaining liquidity. Our second priority will be a measured and balanced application of available cash to reduce our debt and to repurchase our shares consistent with our financial goals for the year. Risk Factors Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, which is incorporated herein by reference. 32 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Our Investment Policy and Guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. Our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and if, in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. As described in the notes to the financial statements, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health and in an insurance agency through our acquisition of Vista. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Administration and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: adverse financial conditions of a specific issuer, monoline bond insurer, segment, industry, region or other variables; the length of the time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer; our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value; elimination or reduction in dividend payments, or scheduled interest and principal; rating agency downgrade of a debt security; and expected cash flows of a debt security. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in fair value below amortized cost that is judged to be otherthantemporary is accounted for as a realized loss and the write down is included in earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. See Note F, Investments, to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. Our investments at December 31, 2008 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair As of December 31, 2008 Cost Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 410,097 $ 411,874 1 to 5 years 590,678 588,629 5 to 10 years 381,324 385,756 Over 10 years 597,655 608,168 Total $ 1,979,754 1,994,427 Equity investments 53,580 Total short term and long term securities $ 2,048,007 Our projections of hypothetical net gains in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
