Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This Item 7 contains forward looking statements as described in Part I. These forward looking statements involved risks and uncertainties described in Part I., Item 1A, Risk Factors. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows: Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in Bethesda, Maryland, operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through our Health Plan and Medical Services Business, Specialized Managed Care Business, and Workers Compensation divisions, we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. Summary of 2009 Performance Revenues from continuing operations increased 18.5% from the prior year Medicare Part D membership growth of 752,000 from the prior year, an increase of 81% Health plan commercial group risk medical loss ratio of 81.9% Cash flow from operations was $881.8 million Debt reduction of $303.5 million from the prior year resulting in a 30.1% debt to capital ratio at year end Operating earnings as a percentage of total revenue were 3.6%, compared to 5.0% in the prior year Income from continuing operations was $315.3 million, a decline of 13% from 2008 income from continuing operations Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $2.14, a decline of 11% from 2008 diluted EPS from continuing operations Operating Revenue and Products We operate health plans, insurance companies, managed care services companies, and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Managed care premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our PPO and POS products are typically lower than our HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Managed care premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in select markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. Operating Expenses We incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk. Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies. Drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs. 20 We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services such as laboratory services and in some cases physician and radiology services. A small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the globally capitated members. Under some capitated arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Global capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that the respective provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in doing so in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 2.9% of the Companys total medical costs for the year ended December 31, 2009. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically, cost effective appropriate services. We incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers. These costs are associated with fee based products. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products. To a lesser extent, our selling, general and administration expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have generally not needed to use external financing to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions, to prepay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions, or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments included on two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2009, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $22.6 million compared with approximately $35.0 million at December 31, 2008. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $21.4 million and $11.0 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for older receivables. We receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership to provide healthcare benefits to our Medicare members. Premiums are fixed (subject to retroactive risk adjustment) on an annual basis by contracts with CMS. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. CMS uses a risk adjustment model that incorporates the use of HCC codes to determine premium payments to health plans. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based on the diagnosis data submitted to CMS. Changes in revenue from CMS resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustments scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. CMS periodically performs audits and may seek return of premium payments made to the company if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by medical record data. We estimate and record reserves for CMS audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates related to the amount of HCC revenue subject to audit and anticipated error rates. Although we believe the Company maintains appropriate reserves for its exposure to the risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 21 We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM, which performs periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments for both our managed care contracts and our experience rated plans based on appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. We enter into performance guarantees with employer groups where we pledge that we will meet certain standards. These standards vary widely and could involve customer service, member satisfaction, claims processing, claims accuracy, telephone response time, etc. We also enter into financial guarantees which can take various forms including, among others, achieving an annual aggregate savings threshold, achieving a targeted level of savings per member per month or achieving overall network penetration in defined demographic markets. For each guarantee, we estimate and record performance based revenue after considering the relevant contractual terms and the data available for the performance based revenue calculation. Pro rata performance based revenue is recognized on an interim basis pursuant to the rights and obligations of each party upon termination of the contracts. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development has been a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively (in thousands). 2009 2008 2007 Medical liabilities, beginning of year $1,446,391 $1,161,963 $1,121,151 Acquisitions (1) 7,590 126,583 Reported Medical Costs Current year 11,049,227 8,916,644 7,055,596 Prior year development (189,833) (48,065) (135,065) Total reported medical costs 10,859,394 8,868,579 6,920,531 Claim Payments Payments for current year 9,598,222 7,577,939 6,134,631 Payments for prior year 1,123,131 1,013,216 586,390 Total claim payments 10,721,353 8,591,155 6,721,021 Change in Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities 20,975 (586) (285,281) Medical liabilities, end of year $1,605,407 $1,446,391 $1,161,963 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 2.1% 0.7% 2.5% Current year paid percent (3) 86.9% 85.0% 86.9% (1) Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2009 prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2008. 22 The significant favorable / (unfavorable) factors driving the overall favorable prior year development for 2009 include: Lower than anticipated medical cost increases of $105.4 million favorable development Lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of $27.5 million favorable development Lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of $12.9 million favorable development Higher than expected completion factors of $50.1 million favorable development Higher than expected inpatient hospital utilization of $(3.6) million unfavorable development Higher than anticipated membership of $(2.5) million unfavorable development The increase in total reported medical cost from 2008 to 2009 was driven primarily by growth in the medical cost base of the Company due to the growth in Part D and PFFS membership and partially due to medical cost inflation. Prior year development experienced in 2008 was less favorable compared to amounts experienced in 2007 and 2009. The lower favorable development is primarily attributable to our PFFS line of business. PFFS experienced unfavorable development in 2008 due to lower than expected completion factors. The change in Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represents subsidy amounts received from CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization and other factors. Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example (in thousands, except percentages) provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2009 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase (Decrease) in Completion Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 1.0 % $ (78,022) (4.0) % $ (100,515) (1.5) % $ (2,641) 0.7 % $ (52,450) (2.5) % $ (62,822) (1.0) % $ (1,761) 0.3 % $ (25,923) (1.0) % $ (25,129) (0.5) % $ (880) (0.3)% $ 26,099 1.0 % $ 25,129 0.5 % $ 880 (0.7) % $ 53,173 2.5 % $ 62,822 1.0 % $ 1,761 (1.0) % $ 79,634 4.0 % $ 100,515 1.5 % $ 2,641 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. A regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and if appropriate, the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience. Our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of December 31, 2009 by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2009. However, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. 23 Investments We account for investments in accordance with ASC Topic 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area; the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security; the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity, net of taxes. When we determine that a decline in fair value below amortized cost is judged to be other than temporary we are required to recognize the credit loss component as a charge in net earnings. Included in net earnings is the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment charge. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. We use prices from independent pricing services and, to a lesser extent, indicative (non binding) quotes from independent brokers, to measure the fair value of our investment securities. We utilize multiple independent pricing services and brokers to obtain fair values; however, we generally obtain one price/quote for each individual security. We perform an analysis on market liquidity and other market related conditions to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. Examples of the procedures performed include, but are not limited to, an on going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different price sources for reasonableness. We monitor pricing inputs to determine if the markets from which the data is gathered are active. As further validation, we sample a securitys past fair value estimates and compare the valuations to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data, which happens infrequently, the price of the security is adjusted accordingly. Generally, we do not adjust prices received from pricing services or brokers, unless it is evident from our verification procedures the fair value measurement is not consistent with ASC Topic 820. Based upon our internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services, we have concluded that the fair values provided by pricing services and brokers are consistent with the guidance in ASC Topic 820. The following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2009. For these investments, the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses State and municipal bonds $ 49,963 $ (833) $ 12,898 $ (538) $ 62,861 $ (1,371) US Treasury securities 8,146 (32) 8,146 (32) Government sponsored enterprises 45,331 (330) 45,331 (330) Residential mortgage backed securities 28,461 (645) 9,658 (287) 38,119 (932) Commercial mortgage backed securities 2,505 (17) 5,580 (490) 8,085 (507) Asset backed securities 2,255 (1,170) 2,255 (1,170) Corporate debt and other securities 119,594 (1,091) 119,594 (1,091) Total $ 254,000 $ (2,948) $ 30,391 $ (2,485) $ 284,391 $ (5,433) The unrealized losses presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporary impairment. The unrealized losses are the result of interest rate movements and significant increases in volatility and liquidity concerns in the securities and credit markets. The Company does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell before a recovery of the amortized cost basis of these securities. Our municipal bond investments remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits (excluding monoline insurers). Although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality, $432.4 million of our $899.6 million total state and municipal bond holdings are insured through a monoline insurer. For our mortgaged backed and asset backed securities, our holdings remain at investment grade with a AAA rating and AA+ rating, respectively. We participate in only the higher level investment tranches. For our asset backed securities, we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment. 24 Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, and Other Long lived Assets Goodwill Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment and periodically if other indicators are present for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We performed a goodwill impairment analysis, at the reporting unit level, as of October 1, our annual impairment test date. However, each year we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if there is any indication of a potential impairment. Those indications may include experiencing disruptions to business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, regulatory actions (such as heath care reform) that may impact operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. For our impairment analysis we relied on both the income approach and the market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. The market approach estimates a businesss fair value by comparing our Company to similar publicly traded entities and also by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. In the case of a publicly traded company, the objective of the market capitalization approach is to determine whether the quoted market price is indicative of the fair value of its reporting units. In addressing the relationship of the determined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, we considered factors outlined in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other including: the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties; quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement, if available; the market price of an individual equity security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole; and the quoted market price of an individual equity security, therefore, need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit. As of October 1, 2009 our market capitalization was below our book value which we considered in our evaluation of fair value of goodwill. We concluded that this did not affect the overall goodwill impairment analysis as we believe our suppressed market capitalization to be primarily attributed to negative market conditions as a result of the credit crisis, the economic recession, debate over health care reform and current pricing and or medical trend issues within the managed care industry. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and managed care industry events. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. We also assume a control premium that is reasonable based on our assessment of control premiums of entities of a similar size and or in a similar industry. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. As discussed in Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements, we recorded an impairment charge of $72.4 million during 2009 related to the sale of FHSC. Other Intangible Assets In accordance with ASC 350 30, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill, we test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have chosen October 1 as our annual impairment testing date. Our only intangible asset that is not subject to amortization consists of a trade name which we determined was not impaired based on the result of the October 1, 2009 analysis. Also in accordance with ASC 350 30 we review intangible assets that are subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Our intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of our customer lists, licenses, and provider networks. Based on events and circumstances, primarily lower than expected customer retention levels, we recorded $5.5 million in impairment charges to certain customer list balances in 2009. See Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets. 25 Other Long Lived Assets In accordance with ASC 360 10 35, we periodically review long lived assets for recoverability whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation for these assets. Our other long lived assets consist of property and equipment which are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. In accordance with ASC 350 40, Internal Use Software, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project. We have not incurred an impairment charge related to our long lived assets. See Note F, Property and Equipment, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to these assets. Stock Based Compensation Expense We account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. We believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone. Therefore, the expected volatility was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note H, Stock Based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock based compensation.

Membership The following table presents our membership as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands). As of December 31, Membership by Product 2009 2008 Health Plan Commercial Risk 1,418 1,575 Health Plan Commercial ASO 685 714 Medicare Advantage CCP 185 137 Medicaid Risk 402 371 Health Plan Total 2,690 2,797 Medicare Advantage PFFS 329 243 Other National Risk 2 24 Other National ASO 565 633 Total Medical Membership 3,586 3,697 Medicare Part D 1,683 931 Total Membership 5,269 4,628 26 Total Health Plan membership decreased 107,000 primarily due to membership losses in Commercial Risk. During 2009, the growth in national unemployment resulted in an acceleration of in group Health Plan Commercial Risk membership attrition compared to 2008. Additionally, the Commercial membership declined as a result of premium pricing increases related to the higher medical cost experienced in 2008. The increase in Medicare Advantage CCP membership is primarily due to the result of our successful annual election period and open enrollment period for 2009 and also due to age ins. Other National ASO membership decreased by 68,000 primarily due to the attrition of membership associated with our loss of National Accounts business compared to 2008. The increases in Medicare Part D membership of 752,000 and Medicare Advantage PFFS of 86,000 were primarily the result of our successful annual election period and open enrollment period for 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, we decided not to renew our PFFS product effective for the 2010 plan year. Our PFFS product represented $2.9 billion in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. Results of Continuing Operations As discussed in Note D, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements, on July 31, 2009 the Company sold its Medicaid/Public entity business First Health Services Corporation (FHSC) and therefore its operations are classified as discontinued on the Companys consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the information below. Accordingly, the amounts and discussion below relate to only the Companys results from continuing operations for all years presented. The following table is provided to facilitate a discussion regarding the comparison of our consolidated results of continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands, except diluted earnings per share amounts): Increase Increase Continuing Operations 2009 2008 (Decrease) 2008 2007 (Decrease) Total operating revenues 13,903,526 11,734,277 18.5% 11,734,277 9,694,176 21.0% Operating earnings 501,951 585,529 (14.3%) 585,529 901,328 (35.0%) Operating earnings as a % of revenue 3.6% 5.0% (1.4%) 5.0% 9.3% (4.3%) Income from continuing operations 315,334 362,000 (12.9%) 362,000 605,444 (40.2%) Diluted earnings per share 2.14 2.41 (11.2%) 2.41 3.85 (37.4%) Selling, general and administrative as a percentage of revenue 15.5% 16.5% (1.0%) 16.5% 17.0% (0.5%) Comparison of 2009 to 2008 Managed care premium revenue increased primarily as a result of higher membership in our Medicare business in Part D, PFFS, and CCP as a result of successful enrollment for 2009. The revenue increases were also a result of increased Individual membership. Partially offsetting this increase was lower revenue for our Commercial Risk business due to membership declines. Management services revenue increased primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the Workers Compensation Division. Medical costs increased primarily as a result of the increase in Medicare membership, as discussed above. Total medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue, medical loss ratio, or MLR increased over the prior year as a result of a change in our mix of business primarily related to Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Commercial Risk. Cost of sales increased due to the growth of the pharmacy benefit management program revenues in the Workers Compensation Division as noted above. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the costs associated with the growth in the Medicare business including higher wage expense, an increase in broker commission costs and other member related costs due to the higher Medicare membership. Additionally there was higher wage expense related to annual incentive compensation accruals in the current year, while such types of incentive payments were not earned and accrued in 2008; new executive hires in the current year; and severance expense related to terminated employees in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue improved as a result of expenses being controlled at a rate lower than the increase in revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2009 primarily due to impairment charges to our customer list balances during 2009. Interest expense decreased due to the repayment of the Companys revolving credit facility and repurchase of senior notes during 2009 as well as decreased interest rates on the revolving credit facility during the current year. Other income, net increased for the current year due to a charge of $33.5 million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities recorded in 2008. This other than temporary impairment loss did not reoccur in 2009. Additionally, other income, net increased due to gains of $8.4 million on the repurchase of outstanding senior notes during 2009. Partially offsetting the increases was a $39 million current year interest income decrease resulting from lower interest rates on the large percentage of the portfolio invested in Treasury instruments and money market funds. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased to 37.5% as compared to 36.7% for the prior year due primarily to the proportion of our earnings in states with higher tax rates. 27 Comparison of 2008 to 2007 Managed care premium revenue increased as a result of growth in existing products, primarily Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D, as well as from our acquisitions during 2007 of Vista Health Plans (Vista) and business from Mutual of Omaha (Mutual). The increase was partially offset by a decline in same store Commercial risk membership over the prior year. Management services revenue increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition of business from Concentra, Inc. (Concentra) and organic growth in our workers compensation services business. This increase was partially offset by the Other National ASO membership decline described above. Medical costs increased as a result of new business as discussed above. Medical costs also increased due to increased Commercial and Medicare PFFS medical cost trends as well as unfavorable IBNR reserve development with respect to our Medicare PFFS business. The Medicare Part D medical loss ratio increase was a result of the premium rate changes from the annual competitive bid filings for our Medicare Part D products and growth in our low income auto assign population in 2008. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to normal operating costs associated with our prior year acquisitions of Concentra, Mutual and Vista, as well as costs related to growth of our Medicare business. Depreciation and amortization expense primarily increased as a result of the expense associated with the amortizable intangible assets identified with our recent acquisitions. Interest expense increased primarily as a result of the issuance of debt during the prior year and due to interest expense incurred on the net draw down of $440.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility in October 2008. The increase was partially offset by the redemption during the first quarter of 2007 of our $170.5 million of outstanding 8.125% senior notes due February 15, 2012. Associated with this redemption, we recognized $9.1 million of interest expense in the prior year first quarter for both the premium paid on redemption as well as the write off of associated deferred financing costs. Other income decreased due to a charge of $36.2 million that consisted of $33.5 million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities and $2.7 million in realized losses on the sale of securities. The decrease also resulted from lower interest rates during 2008. The effective tax rate on continuing operations was essentially flat at 36.7%, as compared to 37.1% for the prior year. 28 Segment Results from Continuing Operations As a result of the change in our executive leadership, we realigned our organizational structure during the first quarter of 2009. The new organizational structure brings enhanced focus to areas of growth opportunities. Accordingly, our reportable segments have changed to the following three reportable segments: Health Plan and Medical Services, Specialized Managed Care, and Workers Compensation. The Companys segment results for the prior years presented have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 segment presentation, including the presentation of discontinued operations.

(2) Revenue per member per month excludes the effect of CMS risk share premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties. 29 Comparison of 2009 to 2008 Health Plan and Medical Services Division Health Plan and Medical Services revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to membership growth in the Medicare PFFS products, coupled with an increase in the average realized premium yield per member per month for the product. Deducting revenue ceded to third parties, the Medicare Advantage risk premium yield per member per month for the year increased to $798.16 in 2009 from $742.07 in 2008. The increase is a result of a smaller portion of our Medicare PFFS business in 2009 being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements. When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Advantage business, we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. Additionally, the Medicare Advantage risk premium yields have increased as a result of higher risk scores. Medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, effective July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009 as well as rate increases in Virginia and West Virginia effective July 1, 2009. The yields also increased due to the termination of our Pennsylvania Medicaid behavioral health contract, which had a lower premium yield. These increases in premium yield were offset by declines in the membership of the Medicaid Risk product. Membership declines also contributed to the reduction in revenue for Commercial Risk products. Gross margin increased primarily due to the growth in the Medicare PFFS and Medicare Advantage businesses as well as the improved medical loss ratios for the Medicare PFFS product. The Medicare PFFS MLRs decreased over the prior year as the prior year included unfavorable IBNR reserve development. The increases in gross margin were partially offset by gross margin declines in Commercial Risk and Medicaid. The Commercial Risk decline in gross margin is a result of the decline in Commercial Risk membership discussed earlier. The decline in Medicaid gross margin was due to a higher medical loss ratio in 2009 as a result of higher medical cost trends and higher inpatient utilization without rate increases sufficient to cover these cost increases. Specialized Managed Care Division Specialized Managed Care revenue experienced a significant increase over the prior year due to the large increase in membership for the Medicare Part D product. Medicare Part D premium yields for 2009, excluding the effect of CMS risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties, decreased compared to 2008, primarily due to the mix of products sold in 2009. The majority of the Medicare Part D growth was in the lower cost, leaner benefit plans, which have a lower premium. Including the effect of the CMS risk sharing premium adjustments as well as the ceded revenue, the premium yields were $80.98 for 2009 compared to $78.84 in 2008. The increase is a result of a smaller portion of our Medicare Part D business in 2009 being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements. When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Part D business, we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. When reviewing the Medicare Part D business, adjusting for the risk share amounts is useful to understand the results of the Part D business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue will eventually be insignificant on a full year basis. The gross margin for the Specialized Managed Care Division improved for 2009 primarily as a result of increased Part D membership during the current periods, offset by an increase in the Part D MLR due to higher than anticipated pharmacy costs in one product. Workers Compensation Division Revenue in the Workers Compensation Division increased in 2009 primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program. The increase was partially offset by lower revenue in the divisions other business lines as a result of lower claim volume. Workers Compensation gross margin decreased over the prior year due to the decline in claims volume in our bill review business, which is a higher margin product, and growth in the pharmacy benefit management program which operates at a lower margin. 30 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately one to two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. Due to the non renewal of our PFFS product, we will be paying medical claims in 2010 without the benefit of premium collections for this product. As a result, this will have a negative effect on cash flows. Despite this, the Company has planned for this market exit and accordingly has ample current liquidity. In addition, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs including satisfaction of policy holder benefits. Our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. Our fixed income portfolio has an average quality rating of AA+ and a modified duration of 2.8 years as of December 31, 2009. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. Our cash and investments, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $75.3 million restricted under state regulations, increased $675.8 million to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2009 from $3.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2009, was a result of net earnings plus non cash adjustments to earnings including the impairment of FHSC goodwill and an increase in both medical liabilities and other payables. The increase in medical liabilities during 2009 is primarily related to the growth in membership across the Medicare business. Other payables increased primarily due to accruals for annual incentive compensation programs, an increase in taxes payable, and Medicare payables. Our net cash from operating activities in 2009 was $254.5 million higher than 2008. The primary driver of this increase was a change in other receivables related to pharmacy rebate receivable accruals and CMS related receivable accruals. Also contributing to the change in cash from operating activities from 2009 compared to 2008 is the change in other payables, which was the result of incentive compensation accruals in 2009 but not in 2008 and the increase in income taxes payable and Medicare payables during 2009. The increase in other receivables during 2008 and other payables during 2009 was partially offset by a decline in net earnings in 2009 compared to 2008 and a smaller increase in medical liabilities in 2009 than in 2008. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately $60.3 million consisted primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. Projected capital expenditures in 2010 of approximately $55 $65 million consisted primarily of computer hardware, software and other equipment. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 was an outflow primarily due to a large amount of investment purchases during the period. This outflow was partially offset by the proceeds received from the sales and maturities of investments and also from the proceeds received from the disposal of FHSC. Additionally, escrow payments totaling $10 million were received during the period from previous acquisitions. During the prior year ended December 31, 2008, we made acquisitions using cash of approximately $137.4 million, net of cash acquired. Financing Activities The details of our debt repayment for 2009 are as follows: We repaid a total of $68.9 million principal amount of our remaining outstanding Senior Notes for payments of $59.9 million, resulting in a gain of $8.4 million, net of the write off of deferred financing costs. We repaid $235.0 million of our Revolving Credit Facility. Our credit facility requires compliance with a leverage ratio. All of our senior notes and credit facility contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding additional debt, dividends or other restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, disposing of assets and in some cases provide for debt repayment upon consolidations or mergers. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with applicable covenants under the senior notes and credit facility. Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, 1.5 million shares were purchased in 2009 at an aggregate cost of $30.0 million, 7.3 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2008 at an aggregate cost of $318.0 million and 7.5 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2007 at an aggregate cost of $429.0 million. As of December 31, 2009, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is 5.2 million. 31 Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2009, we received $121.0 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and infused $293.8 million in capital contributions into our subsidiaries, due primarily to the significant growth of PFFS and Part D in 2009. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards that would generally require higher minimum capitalization requirements for HMOs and other risk bearing health care entities. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit a RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. The State of Florida does not currently use RBC methodology in its regulation of HMOs. Some states, in which our regulated subsidiaries operate, require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in millions, except percentage data). 2009 2008 (unaudited) Regulated capital and surplus $ 1,643.7 $ 1,309.6 200% of RBC (a,b) $ 800.5 $ 665.3 Excess capital and surplus above 200% of RBC (a,b) $ 843.2 $ 644.3 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC (a,b) 411% 394% Statutory deposits $ 75.3 $ 66.5 (a) Unaudited (b) As mentioned above, the State of Florida does not have a RBC requirement for its regulated HMOs. Accordingly, the statutory reserve information provided for Vista is based on the actual statutory minimum capital required by the State of Florida. The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries primarily resulted from net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company, partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments, we had cash and investments of approximately $713.0 million and $549.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase resulted from the proceeds received from the disposal of FHSC, earnings from non regulated businesses, and dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. These were partially offset by capital infusions into our subsidiaries, payments made for share repurchases, and debt repayments. 32 Other As of December 31, 2009, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments during the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Senior notes $ 1,218,998 233,903 602,882 382,213 Interest payable on senior notes 416,520 77,752 147,338 156,824 34,606 Credit facilities 380,029 380,029 Interest payable on credit facilities (a) 7,697 3,044 4,653 Operating leases 142,706 33,692 54,428 36,648 17,938 Total contractual obligations $ 2,165,950 114,488 820,351 796,354 434,757 Less sublease income (7,387) (2,032) (3,185) (1,642) (528) Net contractual obligations $ 2,158,563 112,456 817,166 794,712 434,229 (a) Interest payable on credit facilities has been estimated based on interest rates as of February 2010 and assumes no additional changes in the principal amount. Refer to Note L, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our operating leases. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. As of December 31, 2009, we had $129.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments. Other Disclosures Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. Although the provisions of any future legislation adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time, management believes that the ultimate outcome of currently proposed legislation should not have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations in the short term. Nevertheless, it is possible that future legislation or regulation could have a significant effect on our operations. See Government Regulation under Part I., Item 1 for additional discussion of government regulation that impacts our businesses. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations, in which we assume underwriting risk, we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We cannot be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2010 Outlook Health Plan and Medical Services Division We expect our Commercial Group Risk membership will be down for the year in the low to mid single digit range, excluding the addition of the announced acquisition of Preferred Health Systems (PHS) on February 1, 2010 and its commercial risk membership of approximately 100,000 members. For same store Commercial membership, the forecasted health plan MLR is expected to be in the range of 81.5% to 82.0%, compared to 81.9% for 2009. Including the effect of the PHS acquisition, we expect the total Commercial Group MLR to be in a range of 82.25% to 82.75%. Overall, we expect the acquisition of PHS to be neutral to earnings for the year. As previously announced, we have decided not to renew our national PFFS product for the 2010 plan year. There will be a claims run out period for this product in 2010, which we believe has been adequately reserved for as of the 2009 year end. For our Health Plan based Medicare Advantage product, we currently are forecasting membership to remain approximately flat for 2010 against 2009 results. We expect the 2010 Medicare Advantage MLR to be in the mid 80%s. Specialized Managed Care Division After our significant membership growth in 2009, we expect our Medicare Part D product to be down slightly to approximately 1.6 million members for 2010. This slight decrease reflects the loss of some auto assign regions along with some State Pharmacy Assistance Program members. Our MLR expectation for 2010 will be similar to our actual results in 2009, which was in the mid 80%s. Workers Compensation Division We believe our Workers Compensation Division will remain stable compared to 2009, with continued focus on the supporting administrative cost structure. Regarding our balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the year with approximately $510 million in free cash at the parent level, and approximately $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury securities on a consolidated basis. After a $110 million payment during the fourth quarter in 2009, we have a net balance owing on our revolving line of credit of $380 million. As usual, our first priority with our free cash will be to support the regulatory capital needs of our subsidiaries, and to maintain liquidity. Regarding our effective tax rate, we expect it will range from 37% to 38% for the full year of 2010. 33 Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Our Investment Policy and Guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. Our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and if, in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. As described in the notes to the financial statements, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health and in an insurance agency through our acquisition of Vista. We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or geographic area; the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security; the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. Temporary declines in value of investments classified as available for sale are netted with unrealized gains and reported as a net amount in a separate component of stockholders equity, net of taxes. When we determine that a decline in fair value below amortized cost is judged to be otherthantemporary we are required to recognize the credit loss component as a charge in net earnings. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. See Note G, Investments, to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. Our investments at December 31, 2009 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair As of December 31, 2009 Cost Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 612,960 $ 616,177 1 to 5 years 753,697 780,908 5 to 10 years 440,552 459,092 Over 10 years 516,638 534,165 Total $ 2,323,847 2,390,342 Equity method investments 46,751 Total short term and long term securities $ 2,437,093 Our projections of hypothetical net gains in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projection is based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
