Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This Item 7 contains forward looking statements as described in Part I. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows: Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in Bethesda, Maryland, operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through our Health Plan and Medical Services, Specialized Managed Care, and Workers Compensation reportable segments, which we also refer to as Divisions, we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. Summary of 2010 Performance Revenues from continuing operations, excluding Medicare Advantage Private Fee For Service (PFFS), increased 5.5% from the prior year. Health Plan Commercial Group Risk membership growth of 223,000 from the prior year end, an increase of 15.7%. Medicaid membership growth of 64,000 from the prior year end, an increase of 16.4%. Cash flow from operations of $272.3 million, a decrease from the prior year primarily due to the run out of medical claims from the PFFS product. Debt to capital ratio of 27.6%, a decrease of 8.3% from the prior year. Operating earnings as a percentage of revenues were 5.9%, compared to 3.6% in the prior year. Income from continuing operations of $438.6 million, an increase of 39.1% from 2009 income from continuing operations. Diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.97, an increase of 38.8% from 2009 diluted EPS from continuing operations. Operating Revenue and Products We operate health plans, insurance companies, managed care services companies and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Managed care premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our PPO and POS products are typically lower than our HMO premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Managed care premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in select markets where we believe we can achieve pro fitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally derived from a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. 29 Table of Contents Operating Expenses We incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk. Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national network of pharmacies. Drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs. We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary heath care services, such as laboratory services and, in some cases, physician and radiology services. A small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the capitated members. Under some capitated and professional capitation arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent a provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 6.4% of our total medical costs for the year ended December 31, 2010. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care we provide. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services and encourage the use of outpatient surgery and testing where appropriate. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically appropriate, cost eff ective services. We incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers. These costs are associated with fee based products. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products. To a lesser extent, our selling, general and administration expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have generally not needed to use external financing to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions, to repay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock. Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments included on two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. 30 Table of Contents Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2010, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $25.8 million, compared with approximately $22.6 million at December 31, 2009. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $7.1 million and $21.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease from the prior year is primarily a result of our non renewal of the PFFS product, which generated $2.9 billion of revenue in 2009, and an improvement in our ongoing Medicare Part D collections. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for older receivables. We receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership to provide healthcare benefits to our Medicare members. Premiums are fixed (subject to retroactive risk adjustment) on an annual basis by contracts with CMS. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. CMS uses a risk adjustment model that incorporates the use of hierarchical condition category (HCC) codes to determine premium payments to health plans. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based on the individual member diagnosis data (risk scores) submitted to CMS. Changes in revenue from CMS resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustments scores for our membership a re recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. CMS periodically performs audits and may seek return of premium payments made to us if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by underlying medical record data. We estimate and record reserves for CMS audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates related to the amount of HCC revenue subject to audit and anticipated error rates. Although the Company maintains reserves for its exposure to the risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM, which performs periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participa te in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefits payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments for both our managed care contracts and our experience rated plans based on appropriate guidelines and historical results. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid claims and incurred but not reported claims, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factor s are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. 31 Table of Contents Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calcu lated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively (in thousands). 2010 2009 2008 Medical liabilities, beginning of year $ 1,605,407 $ 1,446,391 $ 1,161,963 Acquisitions (1) 71,548 7,590 Reported Medical Costs Current year 8,507,460 11,049,227 8,916,644 Prior year development (241,513 ) (189,833 ) (48,065 ) Total reported medical costs 8,265,947 10,859,394 8,868,579 Claim Payments Payments for current year 7,491,891 9,598,222 7,577,939 Payments for prior year 1,185,476 1,123,131 1,013,216 Total claim payments 8,677,367 10,721,353 8,591,155 Change in Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities (27,845 ) 20,975 (586 ) Medical liabilities, end of year $ 1,237,690 $ 1,605,407 $ 1,446,391 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 2.2 % 2.1 % 0.7 % Current year paid percent (3) 88.1 % 86.9 % 85.0 % (1) Acquisition Balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2010 prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2009. The significant favorable factors driving the overall 2010 favorable prior year development, excluding PFFS, include: Lower than anticipated medical cost increases of $84.4 million. Higher than expected completion factors of $27.2 million. Lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of $18.2 million. Lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of $6.0 million. The significant favorable factors driving the overall 2010 favorable prior year development for the PFFS product include: Lower than anticipated medical cost increases of $67.6 million. Higher than expected completion factors of $29.7 million. Lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of $0.5 million. Lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of $6.4 million. The reduction in total reported medical cost from 2009 to 2010 was driven primarily as a result of our non renewal of the Medicare PFFS product effective January 1, 2010. Prior year development experienced in 2010 was more favorable compared to amounts experienced in 2009. The higher favorable development is primarily due to lower than expected medical cost increases in the Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care Plan (Medicare Advantage CCP) and PFFS products for 2009. 32 Table of Contents The change in Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represents subsidy amounts received from CMS for reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid relative to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization and other factors. Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example (in thousands, except percentages) provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2010 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor Increase (Decrease) in Completion Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 1.0 % (54,248 ) (4.0 ) % (73,763 ) (1.5 ) % (3,272 ) 0.7 % (36,467 ) (2.5 ) % (46,102 ) (1.0 ) % (2,181 ) 0.3 % (18,023 ) (1.0 ) % (18,441 ) (0.5 ) % (1,091 ) (0.3)% 18,145 1.0 % 18,441 0.5 % 1,091 (0.7) % 36,967 2.5 % 46,102 1.0 % 2,181 (1.0) % 55,362 4.0 % 73,763 1.5 % 3,272 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. A regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and, if appropriate, the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience. Our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of December 31, 2010 by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2010. However, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Investments We account for investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area; the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security; the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; 33 Table of Contents recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other cases, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. We use prices from independent pricing services and, to a lesser extent, indicative (non binding) quotes from independent brokers to measure the fair value of our investment securities. We utilize multiple independent pricing services and brokers to obtain fair values; however, we generally obtain one price/quote for each individual security. We perform an analysis on market liquidity and other market related conditions to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. Examples of the procedures performed include, but are not limited to, an on going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different price sources for reasonableness. We monitor pricing inputs to determine if the markets from which the data is gathered are active. As further validation, we sample a securitys past fair value estimates and compare the valuations to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates. As a result of this analysis, if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data, which happens infrequently, the price of the security is adjusted accordingly. Generally, we do not adjust prices received from pricing services or brokers unless it is evident from our verification procedures the fair value measurement is not consistent with ASC Topic 820. Based upon our internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services, we have concluded that the fair values provided by pricing services and brokers are consistent with the guidance in ASC Topic 820. The following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2010. For these investments, the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses State and municipal bonds $ 156,894 $ (3,068 ) $ $ $ 156,894 $ (3,068 ) U.S. Treasury securities 5,890 (7 ) 5,890 (7 ) Government sponsored enterprises 19,551 (318 ) 19,551 (318 ) Residential mortgage backed securities 59,738 (1,269 ) 17 (1 ) 59,755 (1,270 ) Commercial mortgage backed securities Asset backed securities Corporate debt and other securities 34,405 (588 ) 34,405 (588 ) Total $ 276,478 $ (5,250 ) $ 17 $ (1 ) $ 276,495 $ (5,251 ) The unrealized losses presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporary impairment. The unrealized losses are the result of interest rate movements. We do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before a recovery of the amortized cost basis of these securities. Our municipal bond investments remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits (excluding monoline insurers). Although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality, $331.7 million of our $883.7 million total state and municipal bond holdings are insured through a monoline insurer. For our mortgaged backed and asset backed securities, our holdings remain at investment grade with an AAA rating. We participate in only the higher level investment tranches. For our asset backed securities, we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment. 34 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment and periodic assessments if other indicators are present for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We performed a goodwill impairment analysis, at the reporting unit level, as of October 1, our annual impairment test date. However, each year we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if there is any indication of a potential impairment. Those indications may include experiencing disruptions to business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, regulatory actions (such as heath care reform) that may affect operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. For our impairment analysis we relied on both the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. The market approach estimates the Companys fair value by comparing our Company to similar publicly traded entities and also by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. In order to further validate the fair values determined using the income and market approach for each of our reporting units, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization. The objective of this comparison is to determine whether the quoted market price is indicative of the fair value of its reporting units. In addressing the relationship of the determined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, we considered factors outlined in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, including: the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties; quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement, if available; the market price of an individual equity security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole; and the quoted market price of an individual equity security, therefore, need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit. As of October 1, 2010 our market capitalization was below our book value. We concluded that this did not affect the overall goodwill impairment analysis, as we believe our suppressed market capitalization to be primarily attributed to negative market conditions as a result of the recent economic recession and the enactment of health care reform. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and managed care industry events. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. We reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, the difference of which is generally referred to as an implied control premium. We then collect data on historical control premiums that resulted from business combinations of entities of a similar size and or within our industry and concluded that our implied control premium was reasonable. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results, the estimates underl ying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. See Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets which is incorporated herein by reference. Other Intangible Assets In accordance with ASC 350 30, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill, we test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have chosen October 1 as our annual impairment testing date. Our only intangible asset that is not subject to amortization is a trade name which we determined was not impaired based on the result of the October 1, 2010 analysis. 35 Table of Contents Also in accordance with ASC 350 30 we review intangible assets that are subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In 2010, we did not incur an impairment charge related to our other intangible assets. Our intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of our customer lists, licenses, and provider networks. See Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets which is incorporated herein by reference. Stock Based Compensation Expense We account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. We believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone. Therefore, the expected volatility was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calcu lating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note H, Stock Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stock based compensation which is incorporated herein by reference. New Accounting Standards See Note A, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for information and disclosures related to new accounting standards which is incorporated herein by reference. Acquisitions See Note C, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for information and disclosures related to acquisitions which is incorporated herein by reference. Membership The following table presents our membership as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands). As of December 31, Membership by Product 2010 2009 Health Plan Commercial Risk 1,641 1,418 Health Plan Commercial ASO 698 685 Medicare Advantage CCP 224 186 Medicaid Risk 468 402 Health Plan Total 3,031 2,691 Medicare Advantage PFFS 329 Other National Risk 2 Other National ASO 459 564 Total Medical Membership 3,490 3,586 Medicare Part D 1,628 1,683 Total Membership 5,118 5,269 Total Health Plan membership increased 340,000 compared to December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting an increase in Commercial and Medicare Advantage CCP membership from our acquisitions of Preferred Health Systems, Inc. (PHS) in the first quarter of 2010 and MHP, Inc. (MHP) in the fourth quarter of 2010. The increase also included organic growth in the Commercial membership and increases in the Medicaid membership. Medicaid membership increased as we began enrolling Medicaid members in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the state of Nebraska during 2010, as well as steady growth in other Medicaid markets due to higher unemployment. These increases were partially offset by organic Commercial ASO membership losses as a result of group terminations outpacing new sales. 36 Table of Contents The decrease in Medicare PFFS membership of 329,000 members is due to our decision not to renew our PFFS product for the 2010 plan year. Other National ASO membership decreased 105,000 members, primarily due to the attrition of membership associated with our loss of National Accounts business. The decrease in Medicare Part D of 55,000 members is the result of a reduction in the number of low income regions in which we have contracts, from 29 in 2009 to 21 in 2010, which was offset by growth in our other Medicare Part D products. Results of Continuing Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a discussion regarding the comparison of our consolidated results of continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands, except diluted earnings per share amounts): Increase Increase Continuing Operations 2010 2009 (Decrease) 2009 2008 (Decrease) Total operating revenues $ 11,587,916 $ 13,903,526 (16.7 %) $ 13,903,526 $ 11,734,277 18.5 % Operating earnings $ 689,285 $ 501,951 37.3 % $ 501,951 $ 585,529 (14.3 %) Operating earnings as a % of revenue 5.9 % 3.6 % 2.3 % 3.6 % 5.0 % (1.4 %) Income from continuing operations $ 438,616 $ 315,334 39.1 % $ 315,334 $ 362,000 (12.9 %) Diluted earnings per share 2.97 2.14 38.8 % 2.14 2.41 (11.2 %) Selling, general and administrative as a percentage of revenue 16.9 % 15.5 % 1.4 % 15.5 % 16.5 % (1.0 %) Comparison of 2010 to 2009 As discussed in Note D, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference, on July 31, 2009 the Company sold its Medicaid/Public entity business, First Health Services Corporation (FHSC), and therefore its operations were classified as discontinued on the Companys consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the information below. Accordingly, the amounts and discussion below relate to only the Companys results from continuing operations for all years presented. Managed care premium revenue decreased from the prior year as a result of our exit from the PFFS product line. This exit accounted for a decline of $2.9 billion in revenue during the current year. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisitions of PHS and MHP in 2010, an increase in revenue from Medicare Advantage CCP due to an increase in membership, and an increase in Medicare Part D revenue due to a slightly higher premium yield in 2010. Medical costs decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of not renewing our PFFS product. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in medical costs as a result of the acquisitions of PHS and MHP in 2010. Total medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue, medical loss ratio or MLR, decreased 6.0% over the prior year to 79.4% from 85.4% as a result of the change in the mix of business resulting from the exit of the PFFS product, which had a higher MLR of 92.0%. Additionally, we experienced lower than expected medical trend levels in 2010 which resulted in improved MLR percentages in all lines of business. Cost of sales increased during the current year due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the Workers Compensation Division. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower salaries and benefits costs as well as decreased broker commissions. The salaries and benefits costs decrease resulted from a reduction in the number of full time employees associated with the non renewal of the PFFS product and continued general headcount reductions. Additionally, salaries and benefits declined as a result of executive severance accruals that occurred during the prior year that did not occur in the current year. Broker commissions decreased primarily as a result of the non renewal of the PFFS product. Although lower in absolute terms, selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased as a result of the large decrease in operating revenues in t he current year associated with the non renewal of the PFFS product which had a high premium rate and a low relative expense level. The charge for provider class action results from the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit for the State of Louisiana decision to affirm the trial courts decision to grant summary judgment against a wholly owned subsidiary of Coventry in provider class action litigation in Louisiana state court. As of December 31, 2010 this amount was accrued in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets. For additional information regarding this matter, refer to Note L, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference. 37 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expense was lower during the current year primarily due to the prior year including a write down in value of certain long lived assets as well as certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Interest expense decreased during the current year due to the lower average debt balance outstanding compared to the prior year. Other income, net was lower during the current year as the prior year included a gain on the repayment of outstanding debt. The provision for income taxes increased from the prior year due to the increase in earnings. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased to 36.1% as compared to 37.5% for the prior year due primarily to the proportion of our earnings in states with lower tax rates. Comparison of 2009 to 2008 Managed care premium revenue increased primarily as a result of higher membership in our Medicare business in Part D, PFFS, and CCP as a result of successful enrollment for 2009. The revenue increases were also a result of increased individual membership. Partially offsetting this increase was lower revenue for our Commercial Risk business due to membership declines. Management services revenue increased primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the Workers Compensation Division. Medical costs increased primarily as a result of the increase in Medicare membership, as discussed above. MLR increased over the prior year as a result of a change in our mix of business primarily related to Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Commercial Risk. Cost of sales increased due to the growth of the pharmacy benefit management program revenues in the Workers Compensation Division. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the costs associated with the growth in the Medicare business, including higher wage expense, an increase in broker commission costs and other member related costs due to the higher Medicare membership. Additionally there was higher wage expense related to annual incentive compensation accruals in the current year, while such types of incentive payments were not earned and accrued in 2008; new executive hires in the current year; and severance expense related to terminated employees in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue improved as a result of expenses being controlled at a rate lower than the increase in revenue. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2009 primarily due to impairment charges to our customer list balances during 2009. Interest expense decreased due to the repayment of the Companys revolving credit facility and repurchase of senior notes during 2009 as well as decreased interest rates on the revolving credit facility during the current year. Other income, net increased for the current year due to a charge of $33.5 million for the other than temporary impairment of investment securities recorded in 2008. This other than temporary impairment loss did not reoccur in 2009. Additionally, other income, net increased due to gains of $8.4 million on the repurchase of outstanding senior notes during 2009. Partially offsetting the increases was a $39 million current year interest income decrease resulting from lower interest rates on the large percentage of the portfolio invested in Treasury instruments and money market funds. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased to 37.5% as compared to 36.7% for the prior year due primarily to the proportion of our earnings in states with higher tax rates. 38 Table of Contents Segment Results from Continuing Operations The Companys segment results are as follows.

Comparison of 2010 to 2009 Health Plan and Medical Services Division Health Plan and Medical Services Division revenue decreased for the year primarily due to our exit from the PFFS product line which resulted in a decline of $2.9 billion. Partially offsetting this decrease in revenue was an increase across each of our other risk products. The increase in Commercial Risk revenue was due to the acquisitions of PHS and MHP in 2010. There was an increase in the average realized premium per member per month for the Commercial Risk business due to renewal rate increases. The increase in Medicare Advantage CCP revenue was attributable to the acquisition of MHP as well as the increase in organic membership associated with that product. The Medicare Advantage premium per member per month increased in 2010 as a result of the exit from the PFFS product which had a lower premium rate than the Medicare Advantage CCP product. The PFFS premium yield was lower than the Medicare Advantage CCP premium rate since PFFS typically did not include a pharmacy benefit. The increase in Medicaid revenue was attributable to commencing operations during 2010 in the Nebraska and Pennsylvania markets. The Medicaid premium per member per month decreased in 2010 as a result of program benefit changes in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market. Effective October 1, 2009, the pharmacy ben efit was removed from the program and thus was no longer included in the Missouri Medicaid rate payment. 39 Table of Contents Gross margin increased for the year, primarily due to the improved medical loss ratios for the Health Plan Commercial Risk and Medicare Advantage CCP products. The Commercial Risk MLR decreased from the prior year primarily due to the lower than expected utilization trends and more benign flu season than 2009. The Medicare Advantage CCP MLR decrease resulted from lower than expected utilization trends and demographic changes within the product. Partially offsetting these increases in gross margin was a decrease in gross margin resulting from our exit from the PFFS product. Specialized Managed Care Division Specialized Managed Care Division revenue increased for the year primarily due to an increase in Medicare Part D revenue which resulted from the higher membership volumes in the early portion of 2010. Including the effect of the CMS risk sharing premium adjustments as well as ceded revenue, the premium per member per month was $82.86 in 2010 compared to $80.98 in 2009. Excluding the effect of CMS risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties, Medicare Part D premium per member per month for 2010 increased to $87.96 compared to $84.40 in 2009, primarily due to pharmacy cost trends. When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Part D business, we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. When reviewing the Medicare Part D business, adjusting for the risk sharing amounts is useful to understand the results of the Part D business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue will eventually be insignificant on a full year basis. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved MLR for the Medicare Part D product in 2010 compared to the prior year periods. The improvement in MLR was primarily attributed to improved performance in our mainstream products which make up the majority of our Part D business. Workers Compensation Division Revenue in the Workers Compensation Division decreased slightly from the prior year period primarily due to a decline in volume in our network and clinical programs, partially offset by the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program. Workers Compensation gross margin decreased for the current year due to declines in our network and clinical program volumes, which are higher margin products, partially offset by increases attributable to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program which operates at a lower margin. Comparison of 2009 to 2008 Health Plan and Medical Services Division Health Plan and Medical Services revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to membership growth in the Medicare PFFS products, coupled with an increase in the average realized premium yield PMPM for the product. After deducting revenue ceded to third parties, the Medicare Advantage risk premium yield PMPM for the year increased to $798.16 in 2009 from $742.07 in 2008. The increase is a result of a smaller portion of our Medicare PFFS business in 2009 being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements. When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Advantage business, we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. Additionally, the Medicare Advantage risk premium yields have increased as a result of higher risk scores. Medicaid premium yields increased as a result of rate increases in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, effective July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009 as well as rate increases in Virginia and West Virginia effective July 1, 2009. The yields also increased due to the termination of our Pennsylvania Medicaid behavioral health contract, which had a lower premium yield. These increases in premium yield were offset by declines in the membership of the Medicaid Risk product. Membership declines also contributed to the reduction in revenue for Commercial Risk products. Gross margin increased primarily due to the growth in the Medicare PFFS and Medicare Advantage businesses as well as the improved medical loss ratios for the Medicare PFFS product. The Medicare PFFS MLRs decreased over the prior year as the prior year included unfavorable IBNR reserve development. The increases in gross margin were partially offset by gross margin declines in Commercial Risk and Medicaid. The Commercial Risk decline in gross margin is a result of the decline in Commercial Risk membership discussed earlier. The decline in Medicaid gross margin was due to a higher medical loss ratio in 2009 as a result of higher medical cost trends and higher inpatient utilization without rate increases sufficient to cover these cost increases. Specialized Managed Care Division Specialized Managed Care Division revenue experienced a significant increase over the prior year due to the large increase in membership for the Medicare Part D product. Medicare Part D premium yields for 2009, excluding the effect of CMS risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties, decreased compared to 2008, primarily due to the mix of products sold in 2009. The majority of the Medicare Part D growth was in the lower cost, leaner benefit plans, which have a lower premium. Including the effect of the CMS risk sharing premium adjustments as well as the ceded revenue, the premium yields were $80.98 for 2009 compared to $78.84 in 2008. The increase is a result of a smaller portion of our Medicare Part D business in 2009 being ceded to external parties through quota share arrangements. 40 Table of Contents When reviewing the premium yield for Medicare Part D business, we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. When reviewing the Medicare Part D business, adjusting for the risk sharing amounts is useful to understand the results of the Part D business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue will eventually be insignificant on a full year basis. The gross margin for the Specialized Managed Care Division improved for 2009 primarily as a result of increased Part D membership during the current periods, offset by an increase in the Part D MLR due to higher than anticipated pharmacy costs in one product. Workers Compensation Division Revenue in the Workers Compensation Division increased in 2009 primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program. The increase was partially offset by lower revenue in the Divisions other business lines as a result of lower claim volume. Workers Compensation gross margin decreased over the prior year due to the decline in claims volume in our bill review business, which is a higher margin product, and growth in the pharmacy benefit management program which operates at a lower margin. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately one to two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further positive cash flow. Our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA and a modified duration of 3.61 years as of December 31, 2010. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. Our cash and investments, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $79.9 million restricted under state regulations, increased $195.2 million to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010 from $3.8 billion at December 31, 2009. The demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. For instance, due to the non renewal of our PFFS product, we paid medical claims in 2010 without the benefit of premium collections for this product. As a result, this had a negative effect on cash flows in our regulated subsidiaries. Despite the effect, we have ample current liquidity as a result of planning for the non renewal of the PFFS product. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand, and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments, required payments resulting from judgments or settlements in the Louisiana provider class action litigation, and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. In addition, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs including satisfaction of policy holder benefits. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was a result of net earnings generated by our normal operations during the period and non cash adjustments to earnings including the class action charge. These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in medical claim liabilities associated with the non renewal of the PFFS product. Since premium revenues are generally received in advance of the expected cash payment for the related medical costs, the result is strong cash inflows upon the implementation of a benefit program and cash outflows upon the termination. The cash outflows for PFFS for the year ended December 31, 2010 were approximately $338.5 million. Also partially offsetting the operating cash inflow for the period was a decrease in other payables prim arily as a result of the timing of Federal and State income tax payments. 41 Table of Contents Our net cash from operating activities in 2010 was $609.6 million lower than the 2009 period as the current year period reflects the medical claim payments associated with the PFFS product run out. During 2009, we experienced large positive cash flows from operating activities primarily due to membership growth across the Medicare products. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in 2010 of approximately $63.3 million consisted primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational and communication systems. Projected capital expenditures in 2011 of approximately $65 to $75 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and other equipment. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was an inflow due to proceeds received from investment maturities and sales during the period, partially offset by investment purchases and the payment for our acquisitions of PHS and MHP, net of cash acquired. Financing Activities Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, no shares were repurchased in 2010, 1.5 million shares were purchased in 2009 at an aggregate cost of $30.0 million and 7.3 million shares of our common stock were purchased in 2008 at an aggregate cost of $318.0 million. As of December 31, 2010, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is 5.2 million. Excluded from these share repurchase program amounts are shares purchased in exchange for employee payroll taxes on vesting of restricted stock awards as these purchases are not part of the program. We did not make any debt repayments during 2010. Refer to Note K, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2010, we received $319.4 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and we made $11.5 million in capital contributions to them. We had $1.9 billion of regulated capital and surplus at December 31, 2010. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards which are a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit a RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with the ir annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. 42 Table of Contents The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 (in millions, except percentage data). 2010 2009 (unaudited) Regulated capital and surplus $ 1,908.7 $ 1,636.2 200% of RBC (1, 2) $ 633.8 $ 812.2 Excess capital and surplus above 200% of RBC (1, 2) $ 1,274.9 $ 824.0 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC (1, 2) 602 % 403 % Statutory deposits $ 79.9 $ 75.3 (1) RBC amounts are not audited. (2) The State of Florida does not have a RBC requirement for its regulated HMOs. Accordingly, the statutory reserve information provided for our health plans domiciled in Florida is based on the actual statutory minimum capital required by the State of Florida. The increase in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries primarily resulted from net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company and the acquisitions of PHS and MHP, partially offset by dividends paid to the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments, we had cash and investments of approximately $1.1 billion and $713.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase resulted from earnings from non regulated businesses and dividends from our regulated subsidiaries. These were partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions and capital infusions into our subsidiaries. Other As of December 31, 2010, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments during the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Senior notes $ 1,219,367 $ $ 233,903 $ 603,109 $ 382,355 Interest payable on senior notes 338,769 76,912 133,508 116,746 11,603 Credit facilities 380,029 380,029 Interest payable on credit facilities (1) 4,831 3,160 1,671 Operating leases 125,484 34,116 47,074 30,154 14,140 Total contractual obligations 2,068,480 114,188 796,185 750,009 408,098 Less sublease income (5,418 ) (1,751 ) (2,273 ) (1,318 ) (76 ) Net contractual obligations $ 2,063,062 $ 112,437 $ 793,912 $ 748,691 $ 408,022 (1) Interest payable on credit facilities has been estimated based on interest rates as of December 2010 and assumes no additional changes in the principal amount. The table above does not reflect the timing of cash payments related to income taxes or legal contingencies. Refer to Note I, Income Taxes, and Note L, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our income taxes, operating leases and other contingencies. We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred. Accordingly, we believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and have been excluded from the table above. As of December 31, 2010, we had $136.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments. 43 Table of Contents Other Disclosures Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. The full effect of any current or future legislation provisions adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time. See Government Regulation under Part I, Item 1, Business for additional discussion of government regulation that affects our businesses. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations in which we assume underwriting risk, we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We cannot be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 2011 Outlook Health Plan and Medical Services Division We expect our Commercial Risk membership will be flat to slightly down for 2011 as compared to approximately 1.6 million members in 2010. The forecasted Commercial group MLR is expected to be in the range of 80.5% to 81.5%, an increase from the 2010 MLR of 79.2% largely driven by compliance with new healthcare reform regulations. The forecasted Commercial Individual MLR is expected to be in the range of 75.0% to 77.0%, an increase from the 2010 MLR of 66.1%, largely driven by compliance with new healthcare reform regulations. For our Health Plan based Medicare Advantage CCP product, we are forecasting membership to be flat to slightly down for 2011 as compared to 2010 results. We expect the 2011 Medicare Advantage MLR to be consistent with our Medicare bids in the mid 80%s, an increase from the 2010 MLR of 82.0%. For our Health Plan based Medicaid business, we are forecasting 2011 membership to grow in the mid single digits as compared to 2010 with a MLR in the high 80%s. Specialized Managed Care Division We anticipate membership in our Medicare Part D product to be down by approximately 500,000 members in 2011 from the 2010 ending membership of approximately 1.6 million. This decrease reflects the loss of auto assign regions as well as membership losses driven by a reduction in product offerings from five in 2010 to two in 2011. Our MLR expectation for 2011 will be similar to our actual results in 2010, which was in the mid 80%s. Workers Compensation Division We believe our Workers Compensation Division will grow slightly compared to 2010 with continued focus on the supporting administrative cost structure. Regarding our balance sheet and liquidity, we ended the year with approximately $850 million in free cash at the parent level. We have a net balance owing on our revolving line of credit of $380 million. As usual, our first priority with our free cash will be to support the regulatory capital needs of our subsidiaries and to maintain liquidity. Regarding our effective tax rate, we expect it will range from 36% to 37% for the full year of 2011. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Our Investment Policy and Guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. Our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and, if in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. As described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health. &# 160;We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area; the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security; the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other cases, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. See Note G, Investments and Fair Value Measurements, to our consolidated financi al statements in this Form 10 K for more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments. Our investments at December 31, 2010 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): As of December 31, 2010 Amortized Cost Fair Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 174,639 $ 176,400 1 to 5 years 889,990 922,696 5 to 10 years 499,632 519,296 Over 10 years 543,137 554,473 Total $ 2,107,398 2,172,865 Equity method investments (1) 28,590 Total short term and long term securities $ 2,201,455 (1) Includes investments in entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting and therefore are presented at their carrying value. 45 Table of Contents Our projections of hypothetical net gains (losses) in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projections are based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100, 200 and 300 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
