Item 7: Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This Item 7 contains forward looking statements as described in Part I. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10 K. The organization of our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is as follows: Executive Level Overview Critical Accounting Policies New Accounting Standards Acquisitions Membership Results of Continuing Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Other Disclosures Executive Level Overview General Operations We are a diversified national managed healthcare company based in Bethesda, Maryland, operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through our Health Plan and Medical Services, Specialized Managed Care, and Workers Compensation reportable segments, which we also refer to as Divisions, we provide a full range of risk and fee based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. Summary of 2011 Performance Implemented a Medicaid contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky effective November 1, 2011. Providing services to approximately 221,000 new members at year end. Revenues from operations increased 5.2% from the prior year. Medicare Part D membership decreased by 485,000 members due to a loss of auto assign regions and a reduction in the 2011 product offerings. Cash flow from operations of $401.2 million. Debt to capital ratio of 28.7%, an increase of 1.1% from the prior year. Operating earnings as a percentage of revenues were 7.1%, compared to 5.9% in the prior year. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $3.70, an increase of 24.6% from 2010 diluted EPS from continuing operations. Repurchased 10.7 million shares for $327.7 million during the year. Operating Revenue and Products We operate health plans, insurance companies, managed care services companies and workers compensation services companies and generate our operating revenues from premiums and fees for a broad range of managed care and management service products. Managed care premiums for our commercial risk products, for which we assume full underwriting risk, can vary. For example, premiums for our preferred provider organization (PPO) and point of service (POS) products are typically lower than our health maintenance organization (HMO) premiums due to medical underwriting and higher deductibles and co payments that are typically required of the PPO and POS members. Managed care premium rates for our government programs, Medicare and state sponsored managed Medicaid, are largely established by governmental regulatory agencies. These government products are offered in select markets where we believe we can achieve profitable growth based upon favorable reimbursement levels, provider costs and regulatory climates. 33 Table of Contents Revenue for our management services products (non risk) is generally derived from a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage of savings basis, for access to our health care provider networks and health care management services, for which we do not assume underwriting risk. The management services we provide typically include health care provider network management, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management (PBM), bill review, claims repricing, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. Operating Expenses We incur medical costs related to our products for which we assume underwriting risk. Our medical costs include medical claims paid under contractual relationships with a wide variety of providers and capitation arrangements. Medical costs also include an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain provider networks that furnish health care services through contractual arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. Prescription drug benefits are provided through a formulary comprised of an extensive list of drugs. Drug prices are negotiated at discounted rates through a national pharmacy benefit manager. Drug costs for our risk products are included in medical costs. We have capitation arrangements for certain ancillary health care services, such as laboratory services and, in some cases, physician and radiology services. A small percentage of our membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the capitated members. Under some professional or other capitation arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs but expose us to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. We are ultimately responsible for the coverage of our members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent a provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, we will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, we may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts we would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through our contracted network arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 8.2% of our total medical costs for the year ended December 31, 2011. We have established systems to monitor the availability, appropriateness and effectiveness of the patient care provided to our members by our network providers. We collect utilization data in each of our markets that we use to analyze over utilization or under utilization of services and assist our health plans in arranging for appropriate care for their members and improving patient outcomes in a cost efficient manner. Medical directors also monitor the utilization of diagnostic services. Each health plan collects data showing each physicians utilization profile for diagnostic tests, specialty referrals and hospitalization and presents such data to the health plans physicians. The medical directors monitor these results in an effort to ensure the use of medically appropriate, cost effective services. We incur cost of sales expense for prescription drugs provided by our workers compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers. These costs are associated with fee based products. Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel involved in the administration of services we offer as well as commissions paid to brokers and agents who assist in the sale of our products. To a lesser extent, our selling, general and administrative expenses include other administrative and facility costs needed to provide these administrative services. We operate regional service centers that perform claims processing, premium billing and collection, enrollment and customer service functions. Our regional service centers enable us to take advantage of economies of scale, implement standardized management practices and capitalize on the benefits of our integrated information technology systems. Cash Flows We generate cash through operations. As a profitable company in an industry that is not capital equipment intensive, we have generally not needed to use external financing to fund operations. Our primary use of cash is to pay medical claims. Any excess cash has historically been used for acquisitions, to repay indebtedness and for repurchases of our common stock. 34 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies We consider the accounting policies described below critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are ones that require difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on both a per subscriber contract rate and the number of subscribers in our records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions or other changes. Due to early timing of the premium billing, we are able to identify in the current month the retroactive adjustments included on two subsequent months billings. Current period revenues are adjusted to reflect these retroactive adjustments. Based on information received subsequent to generating premium billings, historical trends, bad debt write offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, we estimate, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future membership retroactivity and adjust our revenue and allowances accordingly. As of December 31, 2011, we maintained allowances for retroactive billing adjustments of approximately $19.7 million, compared with approximately $25.8 million at December 31, 2010. We also maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $4.7 million and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease from the prior year is due to fewer members in 2011. The calculation for these allowances is based on a percentage of the gross accounts receivable with the allowance percentage increasing for older receivables. We receive premium payments from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a monthly basis for our Medicare membership to provide healthcare benefits to our Medicare members. Premiums are fixed (subject to retroactive risk adjustment) on an annual basis by contracts with CMS. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and can result in adjustments to revenue. CMS uses a risk adjustment model that incorporates the use of hierarchical condition category (HCC) codes to determine premium payments to health plans. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based on the individual member diagnosis data (risk scores) submitted to CMS. Changes in revenue from CMS resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. CMS periodically performs audits and may seek return of premium payments made to us if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by underlying medical record data. We estimate and record reserves for CMS audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made. The judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include, among other things, significant estimates related to the amount of HCC revenue subject to audit, anticipated error rates, sample methodologies, confidence intervals, enrollee selection, and payment error extrapolation methodology. Certain of the Companys health plans may be selected for audit. Although we maintain reserves for our exposure to the risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. We contract with the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and with various federal employee organizations to provide health insurance benefits under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). These contracts are subject to government regulatory oversight by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of OPM, which performs periodic audits of these benefit program activities to ensure that contractors meet their contractual obligations with OPM. For our managed care contracts, the OIG conducts periodic audits to, among other things, verify that premiums established under its contracts are in compliance with community rating requirements under the FEHBP. The OPM may seek premium refunds or institute other sanctions against health plans that participate in the program. For our experience rated plans, the OIG focuses on the appropriateness of contract charges, the effectiveness of claims processing, financial and cost accounting systems, and the adequacy of internal controls to ensure proper contract charges and benefit payments. The OIG may seek refunds of costs charged under these contracts or institute other sanctions against health plans. These audits are generally a number of years in arrears. We estimate and record reserves for audit and other contract adjustments for both our managed care contracts and our experience rated plans based on appropriate guidelines and historical results. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized. 35 Table of Contents Effective in 2011, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, PPACA), commercial health plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) on fully insured products are required to issue rebates to policyholders if the actual loss ratio falls below the target. The mandated minimum MLR targets for health plans (as calculated under the definitions in PPACA and related regulations), such that the percentage of health coverage premium revenue spent on health care medical costs and quality improvement expenses, are set at 85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, subject to state specific exceptions. The potential for and size of the rebates are measured by regulated subsidiary, state and market segment (individual, small group and large group). Accordingly, in the current year, we have recorded a rebate estimate in the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities line in the accompanying balance sheet and as contra revenue in managed care premiums in the accompanying statements of operations. We estimate the rebate liability based on judgments and estimated information, including utilization, unit cost trends, quality improvement costs, and product pricing, features and benefits. If actual experience varies from our estimates or future regulatory guidance differs from our current judgments, the actual rebate liability could differ from our estimates. Medical Claims Expense and Liabilities Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. Medical liabilities estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider, among other things, historical claims payment patterns, provider reimbursement changes, historical utilization trends, current levels of authorized inpatient days, other medical cost inflation factors, membership levels, benefit design changes, seasonality, demographic mix change and other relevant factors. We employ a team of actuaries that have developed, refined and used the same set of reserve models over the past several years. These reserve models do not calculate separate amounts for reported but not paid and incurred but not reported, but rather a single estimate of medical claims liabilities. These reserve models make use of both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Within these models, historical data of paid claims is formatted into claim triangles which compare claim incurred dates to the claim payment dates. This information is analyzed to create completion factors that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the current period. For the more recent incurred months, the percentage of claims paid to claims incurred in those months is generally low. As a result, the completion factor methodology is less reliable for such months. For that reason, incurred claims for recent months are not projected solely from historical completion and payment patterns. Instead, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based upon recent claims expense levels and health care trend levels, or trend factors. As these months mature over time, the two estimates (completion factor and trend) are blended with completion factors being used exclusively for older months. Actuarial estimates of claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. Actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims estimates to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims. In many situations, the claims paid amount experienced will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. Medical claims liabilities are recorded at an amount we estimate to be appropriate. Adjustments of prior years estimates may result in additional medical costs or, as we experienced during the last several years, a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made. Our reserve models have historically developed favorably suggesting that the accrued liabilities calculated from the models were more than adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims. We believe that this favorable development has been a result of good communications between our health plans and our actuarial staff regarding medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trend. 36 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively (in thousands). 2011 2010 2009 Medical liabilities, beginning of year $ 1,237,690 $ 1,605,407 $ 1,446,391 Acquisitions (1) 71,548 Reported Medical Costs Current year 9,163,009 8,507,460 11,049,227 Prior year development (121,607 ) (241,513 ) (189,833 ) Total reported medical costs 9,041,402 8,265,947 10,859,394 Claim Payments Payments for current year 7,953,744 7,491,891 9,598,222 Payments for prior year 989,783 1,185,476 1,123,131 Total claim payments 8,943,527 8,677,367 10,721,353 Change in Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities (27,058 ) (27,845 ) 20,975 Medical liabilities, end of year $ 1,308,507 $ 1,237,690 $ 1,605,407 Supplemental Information: Prior year development (2) 1.5 % 2.2 % 2.1 % Current year paid percent (3) 86.8 % 88.1 % 86.9 % (1) Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date. (2) Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs. (3) Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2011 prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2010. The significant favorable / (unfavorable) factors driving the overall favorable prior year development for 2011 include: Lower than anticipated medical cost increases of $64.7 million. Lower than anticipated large claim liabilities of $27.6 million. Lower than anticipated other specific case liabilities of $21.9 million. Higher than expected completion factors of $10.9 million. Higher than expected inpatient hospital utilization of ($6.2) million. Prior year development experienced in 2011 was less favorable compared to amounts experienced in 2010. The lower 2011 favorable development is primarily due to the non renewal of the Medicare PFFS product. The Medicare PFFS product experienced favorable reserve development during 2010 which was not experienced in the current year. This resulted in a $95.8 million reduction in favorable restatements when compared to 2010. The change in Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represents subsidy amounts received from CMS for reinsurance, coverage gap and for cost sharing related to low income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. Within the reserve setting methodologies for inpatient and non inpatient services, we use certain assumptions. For inpatient services, authorized days are used for utilization factors, while cost trend assumptions are incorporated into per diem amounts. The per diem estimates reflect anticipated effects of changes in reimbursement structure and severity mix. For non inpatient services, a composite trend assumption is applied which reflects anticipated changes in cost per service, provider contracts, utilization and other factors. 37 Table of Contents Changes in the completion factors, trend factors and utilization factors can have a significant effect on the claim liability. The following example (in thousands, except percentages) provides the estimated effect to our December 31, 2011 unpaid claims liability assuming hypothetical changes in the completion, trend, and inpatient day factors. While we believe the selection of factors and ranges provided are reasonable, certain factors and actual results may differ. Completion Factor Claims Trend Factor Inpatient Day Factor (Decrease) Increase in Completion Factor Increase (Decrease) in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Claims Trend Factor Increase (Decrease) in Unpaid Claims Liabilities (Decrease) Increase in Inpatient Days Increase (Decrease) in Unpaid Claims Liabilities 1.0 % $ (56,063 ) (4.0 %) $ (77,093 ) (3.0 %) $ (8,041 ) 0.7 % $ (37,688 ) (2.5 %) $ (48,183 ) (2.0 %) $ (5,361 ) 0.3 % $ (18,627 ) (1.0 %) $ (19,273 ) (1.0 %) $ (2,680 ) (0.3 %) $ 18,752 1.0 % $ 19,273 1.0 % $ 2,680 (0.7 %) $ 38,206 2.5 % $ 48,183 2.0 % $ 5,361 (1.0 %) $ 57,217 4.0 % $ 77,093 3.0 % $ 8,041 We also establish reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under our existing provider contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. A regular element of our unpaid medical claim liability estimation process is the examination of actual results and, if appropriate, the modification of assumptions and inputs related to the process based upon past experience. Our reserve setting methodologies have taken these changes into consideration when determining the factors used in calculating our medical claims liabilities as of December 31, 2011 by choosing factors that reflect more recent experience. We believe that the amount of medical liabilities is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2011. However, actual claim payments and other items may differ from established estimates. Investments We account for investments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 320 Investments Debt and Equity Securities. We invest primarily in fixed income securities and classify all of our investments as available for sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area; the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security; the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. 38 Table of Contents For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other cases, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. We use prices from independent pricing services and, when necessary, indicative (non binding) quotes from independent brokers to measure the fair value of our investment securities. We utilize multiple independent pricing services and brokers to obtain fair values; however, we generally obtain one price/quote for each individual security. We perform an analysis on market liquidity and other market related conditions to assess if the evaluated prices represent a reasonable estimate of their fair value. Examples of the procedures performed include, but are not limited to, an on going review of pricing service methodologies, review of the prices received from the pricing service and comparison of prices for certain securities with two different price sources for reasonableness. We monitor pricing inputs to determine if the markets from which the data is gathered are active. As further validation, we sample a securitys past fair value estimates and compare the valuations to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates. Generally, we do not adjust prices received from pricing services or brokers unless it is evident from our verification procedures the fair value measurement is not consistent with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Based upon our internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services, we have concluded that the fair values provided by pricing services and brokers are consistent with the guidance in ASC Topic 820. The following table includes only our investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2011. For these investments, the table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position (in thousands). At December 31, 2011 Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total Description of Securities Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses State and municipal bonds $ 9,436 $ (7 ) $ $ $ 9,436 $ (7 ) U.S. Treasury securities 4,932 (4 ) 4,932 (4 ) Government sponsored enterprise securities 12,495 (11 ) 12,495 (11 ) Residential mortgage backed securities 5,127 (11 ) 43 (1 ) 5,170 (12 ) Commercial mortgage backed securities Asset backed securities Corporate debt and other securities 350,294 (10,178 ) 350,294 (10,178 ) Total $ 382,284 $ (10,211 ) $ 43 $ (1 ) $ 382,327 $ (10,212 ) The unrealized losses presented in this table do not meet the criteria for an other than temporary impairment. The unrealized losses are the result of interest rate movements. We do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before a recovery of the amortized cost basis of these securities. Our municipal bond investments remain at an investment grade status based on their own merits (excluding monoline insurers). Although we do not rely on bond insurers exclusively to maintain our high level of investment credit quality, $244.9 million of our $1,032.9 million total state and municipal bond holdings are insured through a monoline insurer. For our mortgage backed and asset backed securities, our holdings remain at investment grade with AA+ and AAA ratings, respectively. We participate in only the higher level investment tranches. For our asset backed securities, we only participate in offerings that are over collateralized to further protect our principal investment. 39 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment and periodic assessments if other indicators are present for impairment by applying a fair value based test. We performed a goodwill impairment analysis, at the reporting unit level, as of October 1, our annual impairment test date. However, each year we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if there is any indication of a potential impairment. Those indications may include experiencing disruptions to business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, regulatory actions (such as health care reform) that may affect operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization. The goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. For our impairment analysis we relied on both the income and market approaches. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows. The income approach involves estimating the present value of our estimated future cash flows utilizing a risk adjusted discount rate. The market approach estimates the Companys fair value by comparing our Company to similar publicly traded entities and also by analyzing the recent sales of similar companies. The approaches were reviewed together for consistency and commonality. In order to further validate the fair values determined using the income and market approach for each of our reporting units, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization. The objective of this comparison is to determine whether the quoted market price is indicative of the fair value of its reporting units. In addressing the relationship of the determined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, we considered factors outlined in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, including: the fair value of a reporting unit refers to the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties; quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement, if available; the market price of an individual equity security (and thus the market capitalization of a reporting unit with publicly traded equity securities) may not be representative of the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole; and the quoted market price of an individual equity security, therefore, need not be the sole measurement basis of the fair value of a reporting unit. As of October 1, 2011 our market capitalization was below our book value. We concluded that this did not affect the overall goodwill impairment analysis, as we believe our suppressed market capitalization to be primarily attributed to negative economic conditions and the enactment of health care reform. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and managed care industry events. Any impairment charges that may result will be recorded in the period in which the impairment is identified. We reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, the difference of which is generally referred to as an implied control premium. We then collect data on historical control premiums that resulted from business combinations of entities of a similar size and or within our industry and concluded that our implied control premium was reasonable. Additionally, the excess of fair value over the carrying value for our reporting units ranged from 17% to 96%. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values of the reporting units and other intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. Under the income approach, we assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in our calculations. If the assumptions used in our fair value based tests differ from actual results, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. See Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other Intangible Assets In accordance with ASC Topic 350 30, General Intangibles Other than Goodwill, we test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We have chosen October 1 as our annual impairment testing date. Our only intangible asset that is not subject to amortization is a trade name which we determined was not impaired based on the result of the October 1, 2011 analysis. 40 Table of Contents Also in accordance with ASC Topic 350 30 we review intangible assets that are subject to amortization for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In 2011, we did not incur an impairment charge related to our other intangible assets. Our intangible assets that are subject to amortization consist of our customer lists, licenses, and provider networks. See Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to our goodwill and other intangible assets, which is incorporated herein by reference. Stock Based Compensation Expense We account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation Stock Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC Topic 718, determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility. We believe that a blend of the implied volatility of our tradeable options and the historical volatility of our share price is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility alone. Therefore, the expected volatility was based on a blend of market based implied volatility and the historical volatility of our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note I, Stock Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on stock based compensation, which is incorporated herein by reference. New Accounting Standards See Note A, Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements for information and disclosures related to new accounting standards, which is incorporated herein by reference. Acquisitions See Note C, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for information and disclosures related to acquisitions, which is incorporated herein by reference. Membership The following table presents our membership as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands). As of December 31, Increase Membership by Product 2011 2010 (Decrease) Health Plan Commercial Risk 1,635 1,641 (6 ) Health Plan Commercial ASO 700 698 2 Medicare Advantage CCP 222 224 (2 ) Medicaid Risk 692 468 224 Health Plan Total 3,249 3,031 218 Other National ASO 373 459 (86 ) Total Medical Membership 3,622 3,490 132 Medicare Part D 1,143 1,628 (485 ) Total Membership 4,765 5,118 (353 ) Total Health Plan membership increased 218,000 compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to the new contract with the Commonwealth of Kentucky to provide services for the Commonwealths Medicaid program, effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. Other National ASO membership decreased 86,000 primarily due to a decline of our FEHBP membership. The decrease in Medicare Part D membership of 485,000 was a result of the loss of auto assign regions as well as a reduction in product offerings from five in 2010 to two in 2011. 41 Table of Contents Results of Continuing Operations The following table is provided to facilitate a discussion regarding the comparison of our consolidated results of continuing operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands, except diluted earnings per share amounts). For additional financial information, see the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which is incorporated herein by reference. Increase Increase Continuing Operations 2011 2010 (Decrease) 2010 2009 (Decrease) Total operating revenues $ 12,186,683 $ 11,587,916 5.2 % $ 11,587,916 $ 13,903,526 (16.7 %) Operating earnings $ 868,130 $ 689,285 25.9 % $ 689,285 $ 501,951 37.3 % Operating earnings as a % of revenue 7.1 % 5.9 % 1.2 % 5.9 % 3.6 % 2.3 % Income from continuing operations $ 543,105 $ 438,616 23.8 % $ 438,616 $ 315,334 39.1 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.70 $ 2.97 24.6 % $ 2.97 $ 2.14 38.8 % Selling, general and administrative as a percentage of revenue 16.5 % 16.9 % (0.4 %) 16.9 % 15.5 % 1.4 % Comparison of 2011 to 2010 Managed Care Premiums Managed care premium revenue increased from the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition of MHP, Inc. (MHP) in the fourth quarter of 2010. Revenue also increased as a result of organic membership growth and an increase in the average realized premium per member per month. The increase was also attributed to Medicaid Risk revenue due to new markets entered during August 2010 in the State of Nebraska and the launch of the new Kentucky Medicaid contract, effective November 1, 2011. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Medicare Part D revenue as a result of the loss of membership resulting from the aforementioned loss of auto assign regions and reduction in product offerings. The increases mentioned above were also partially offset by an accrual for the minimum medical loss ratio rebate for our Commercial business required by PPACA. Medical Costs and Cost of Sales Medical costs increased from the prior year primarily as a result of the acquisition of MHP, new Medicaid Risk markets entered during 2010 and 2011, and organic membership growth and medical trends. This was partially offset by the decrease in Medicare Part D membership, as noted above. The overall total medical costs as a percentage of premium revenue, MLR, increased 2.7% over the prior year to 82.1% from 79.4%. The increase is primarily as a result of the minimum MLR mandates previously described as well as the MLR increases during the current year for the Medicare Advantage and Medicaid products, as described in the segment results of operations discussion that follows. The MLR increase was partially offset by a lower MLR during the current year for the Medicare Part D MLR as a result of improved performance in our basic benefit product in 2011. Cost of sales increased due to continued growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the Workers Compensation division. Selling, General and Administrative and Provider Class Action Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily due to the addition of normal operating costs associated with MHP including, but not limited to, salaries and benefits, professional fees and premium taxes. The increase is also due to start up costs associated with the implementation of the Kentucky Medicaid contract and increased marketing expenses associated with the rollout of expanded Medicare products for 2012. The increase is partially offset by lower legal fees in the current year as the prior year included incremental legal fees related to the provider class action in Louisiana that were not incurred in 2011. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues decreased as a result of the growth in operating revenues in the current year. During the second quarter of 2010, a $278.0 million charge for a provider class action was recorded resulting from the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit for the State of Louisiana decision to affirm the trial courts decision to grant summary judgment against a wholly owned subsidiary of Coventry in provider class action litigation in Louisiana state court. On May 27, 2011, the court entered an order of final approval of a settlement and, accordingly, we recorded a non recurring pre tax adjustment to earnings of $159.3 million in the second quarter of 2011. For additional information regarding the provider class action, refer to Note M, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 42 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was lower during the current year primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Interest Expense and Other Income, Net Interest expense increased due to the issuance of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.450% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) in the second quarter of 2011. This increase was partially offset by reduced interest expense on our revolving credit facility due to the repayment of the outstanding balance in the second quarter of 2011. Other income, net increased as income in the current year included more realized gains on the sales of investments compared to 2010. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased from the prior year due to an increase in earnings. The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased to 36.7% as compared to 36.1% for the prior year due primarily to the proportion of our earnings in states with higher tax rates and by compliance with new health care reform regulations. Comparison of 2010 to 2009 As discussed in Note D, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference, on July 31, 2009 the Company sold its Medicaid/Public entity business, First Health Services Corporation (FHSC), and therefore its operations were classified as discontinued on the Companys consolidated statements of operations and excluded from the information below. Accordingly, the amounts and discussion below relate to only the Companys results from continuing operations for all years presented. Managed Care Premiums Managed care premium revenue decreased as a result of our exit from the Medicare PFFS product line. This exit accounted for a decline of $2.9 billion in revenue in 2010. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in revenue as a result of the acquisitions of Preferred Health Systems, Inc. (PHS) and MHP in 2010, an increase in revenue from Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care Plans (Medicare Advantage CCP) due to an increase in membership, and an increase in Medicare Part D revenue due to a slightly higher premium yield in 2010. Medical Costs and Cost of Sales Medical costs decreased primarily as a result of not renewing our Medicare PFFS product. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in medical costs as a result of the acquisitions of PHS and MHP in 2010. Total MLR decreased 6.0% over the prior year to 79.4% from 85.4% as a result of the change in the mix of business resulting from the non renewal of the Medicare PFFS product, which had a higher MLR of 92.0%. Additionally, we experienced lower than expected medical trend levels in 2010 which resulted in improved MLR percentages in all lines of business. Cost of sales increased due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program in the Workers Compensation Division. Selling, General and Administrative and Provider Class Action Selling, general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to lower salaries and benefits costs as well as decreased broker commissions. The salaries and benefits costs decrease resulted from a reduction in the number of full time employees associated with the non renewal of the Medicare PFFS product and continued general headcount reductions. Additionally, salaries and benefits declined as a result of executive severance accruals that occurred during the prior year that did not occur in the current year. Broker commissions decreased primarily as a result of the non renewal of the Medicare PFFS product. Although lower in absolute terms, selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased as a result of the large decrease in operating revenues in the current year associated with the non renewal of the Medicare PFFS product which had a high premium rate and a low relative expense level. 43 Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2010, a $278.0 million charge for a provider class action was recorded resulting from the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit for the State of Louisiana decision to affirm the trial courts decision to grant summary judgment against a wholly owned subsidiary of Coventry in provider class action litigation in Louisiana state court. For additional information regarding the provider class action, refer to Note M, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense was lower primarily due to the prior year including a write down in value of certain long lived assets as well as certain assets becoming fully depreciated. In 2009, an impairment charge to the customer list balances was recorded as a result of lower than expected customer retention levels in the Health Plan and Medical Services operating segment and the Specialized Managed Care operating segment. Interest Expense and Other Income, Net Interest expense decreased due to the lower average debt balance outstanding compared to the prior year. Other income, net was lower as the prior year included a gain on the repayment of outstanding debt. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes increased due to the increase in earnings. The effective tax rate on continuing operations decreased to 36.1% as compared to 37.5% for the prior year due primarily to the proportion of our earnings in states with lower tax rates. 44 Table of Contents Segment Results from Continuing Operations The Companys segment results are as follows.

This increase in Commercial risk and Medicare Advantage is primarily due to the acquisition of MHP in October 2010. The increase in Medicaid Risk revenue is due to entering new markets in August 2010 in the State of Nebraska and in November 2011 in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue was a decrease in Commercial Management Services revenue due to a decline of our FEHBP membership. There was an increase in the average realized premium per member per month for the Commercial Risk business due to renewal rate increases. The increase in Commercial Risk revenue was partially offset by the accruals for the minimum MLR rebates, discussed above. Medicare Advantage revenues increased primarily due to the acquisition of MHP, as well as a general increase in premiums per member per month. The increase in Medicaid Risk revenue is primarily due to the two new markets, previously described. The Medicaid risk premiums per member per month increased as a result of a rate increase effective July 1, 2011, in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market, the implementation of the Kentucky contract which has a higher than average premium per member per month and due to a change in member mix in our Nebraska market. The gross margin for this Division decreased for the year primarily due to lower favorable prior year medical cost development, the accrual for the minimum MLR rebate for our Commercial business and a decrease in the Medicare PFFS gross margin. The Medicare PFFS product was not renewed effective January 1, 2010. The Medicare PFFS product experienced much more favorable incurred but not reported reserve development during 2010 which was not experienced in the current year. These decreases were offset by growth due to the acquisition of MHP, as well as organic growth in existing markets. The Commercial Risk MLR increased for the year primarily due to the accruals for the minimum MLR rebates as well as utilization beginning to return to normal levels. The Medicare Advantage MLR and Medicaid MLR have increased for the year primarily due to utilization beginning to return to normal levels. Additionally, the Medicaid MLR has increased for the year due to higher initial medical costs associated with the new Kentucky business. Specialized Managed Care Division Specialized Managed Care division revenue decreased for the year primarily due to lower Medicare Part D membership as a result of the loss of auto assign regions as well as a reduction in product offerings from five in 2010 to two in 2011. Including the effect of the CMS risk sharing premium adjustments as well as ceded revenue, the premium per member per month was $88.80 in 2011 compared to $82.86 in 2010. Excluding the effect of CMS risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties, Medicare Part D premium per member per month for 2011 increased to $92.41 compared to $87.96 in 2010, primarily due to pharmacy cost trends and the loss of the lower priced premium products. When reviewing the premium yield for the Medicare Part D business, we believe that adjusting for the ceded revenue is useful for comparisons to competitors that may not have similar ceding arrangements. When reviewing the Medicare Part D business, adjusting for the risk sharing amounts is useful to understand the results of the Part D business because of our expectation that the risk sharing revenue is insignificant on a full year basis. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by the Medicare Part D membership losses. This is partially offset by improved MLR on the Medicare Part D product and improved performance in our Mental Health products. The Medicare Part D MLR was lower than the prior year as a result of improved performance in our basic benefit product in 2011. Workers Compensation Division Workers Compensation division revenue increased for the year primarily due to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program, which was partially offset by a decline in volume and rates in our network products. Workers Compensation gross margin decreased slightly for the year primarily due to decline in volume and rates in our network products offset by increased volume in our pharmacy benefit management program. The decrease was partially offset by the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program. 46 Table of Contents Comparison of 2010 to 2009 Health Plan and Medical Services Division Health Plan and Medical Services Division revenue decreased primarily due to our exit from the Medicare PFFS product line which resulted in a decline of $2.9 billion. Partially offsetting this decrease in revenue was an increase in revenue across each of our other risk products. The increase in Commercial Risk revenue was due to the acquisitions of PHS and MHP in 2010. There was an increase in the average realized premium per member per month for the Commercial Risk business due to renewal rate increases. The increase in Medicare Advantage CCP revenue was attributable to the acquisition of MHP as well as the increase in organic membership associated with that product. The Medicare Advantage premium per member per month increased in 2010 as a result of the exit from the Medicare PFFS product which had a lower premium rate than the Medicare Advantage CCP product. The Medicare PFFS premium yield was lower than the Medicare Advantage CCP premium rate since Medicare PFFS typically did not include a pharmacy benefit. The increase in Medicaid revenue was attributable to commencing operations during 2010 in the Nebraska and Pennsylvania markets. The Medicaid premium per member per month decreased in 2010 as a result of program benefit changes in Missouri, our largest Medicaid market. Effective October 1, 2009, the pharmacy benefit was removed from the program and thus was no longer included in the Missouri Medicaid rate payment. Gross margin increased primarily due to the improved medical loss ratios for the Health Plan Commercial Risk and Medicare Advantage CCP products. The Commercial Risk MLR decreased primarily due to the lower than expected utilization trends and more benign flu season than 2009. The Medicare Advantage CCP MLR decrease resulted from lower than expected utilization trends and demographic changes within the product. Partially offsetting these increases in gross margin was a decrease in gross margin resulting from our exit from the Medicare PFFS product. Specialized Managed Care Division Specialized Managed Care Division revenue increased primarily due to an increase in Medicare Part D revenue which resulted from the higher membership volumes in the early portion of 2010. Including the effect of the CMS risk sharing premium adjustments as well as ceded revenue, the premium per member per month was $82.86 in 2010 compared to $80.98 in 2009. Excluding the effect of CMS risk sharing premium adjustments and revenue ceded to external parties, Medicare Part D premium per member per month for 2010 increased to $87.96 compared to $84.40 in 2009, primarily due to pharmacy cost trends. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved MLR for the Medicare Part D product in 2010 compared to 2009. The improvement in MLR was primarily attributed to improved performance in our mainstream products which make up the majority of our Part D business. Workers Compensation Division Revenue in the Workers Compensation Division decreased slightly primarily due to a decline in volume in our network and clinical programs, partially offset by the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program. Workers Compensation gross margin decreased due to declines in our network and clinical program volumes, which are higher margin products, partially offset by increases attributable to the growth of our pharmacy benefit management program which operates at a lower margin. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity The nature of a majority of our operations is such that cash receipts from premium revenues are typically received up to two months prior to the expected cash payment for related medical costs. Premium revenues are typically received at the beginning of the month in which they are earned, and the corresponding incurred medical expenses are paid in a future time period, typically 15 to 60 days after the date such medical services are rendered. The lag between premium receipts and claims payments creates positive cash flow and overall cash growth. As a result, we typically hold approximately one to two months of float. In addition, accumulated earnings provide further liquidity. Our investment guidelines require our fixed income securities to be investment grade in order to provide liquidity to meet future payment obligations and minimize the risk to the principal. The fixed income portfolio includes government and corporate securities with an average quality rating of AA and an effective duration of 3.66 years as of December 31, 2011. Typically, the amount and duration of our short term assets are more than sufficient to pay for our short term liabilities and we do not anticipate that sales of our long term investment portfolio will be necessary to fund our claims liabilities. 47 Table of Contents Our cash and investments, consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and long term investments, but excluding deposits of $74.0 million restricted under state regulations, increased $281.0 million to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2011 from $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010. The demand for our products and services is subject to many economic fluctuations, risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the way we do business. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Form 10 K for more information. Management believes that the combination of our ability to generate cash flows from operations, cash and investments on hand, and the excess funds held in certain of our regulated subsidiaries will be sufficient to fund continuing operations, capital expenditures, debt interest costs, debt principal repayments and any other reasonably likely future cash requirements. In addition, our long term investment portfolio is available for further liquidity needs including satisfaction of policy holder benefits. Cash Flows Operating Activities Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was an inflow as a result of net earnings generated by our normal operations during the period, net of adjustments to earnings, an increase in medical liabilities primarily due to the implementation of our Kentucky Medicaid contract and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities related to minimum MLR rebate accruals. Offsetting these inflows is an increase in other receivables related to the timing of settlement of current year subsidy receivables for our Medicare business due from CMS that we expect to receive in 2012. Additionally, offsetting these inflows was $150.5 million paid to settle the provider class action litigation in Louisiana. For additional information regarding the provider class action matter, refer to Note M, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financials statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Our net cash from operating activities in 2011 increased $128.9 million from the corresponding 2010 period. The increase was primarily a result of the unusually low cash flows in the prior year due to payments of medical claims liabilities associated with run out of the Medicare PFFS product. The nature of our business is such that premium revenues are generally received in advance of the expected cash payment for the related medical costs. This results in strong cash inflows upon the implementation of a benefit program and cash outflows upon the termination. Partially offsetting these increased inflows are the increase in current year subsidy receivables for our Medicare Part D business due from CMS and $150.5 million paid to settle the provider class action litigation in Louisiana. Our net cash from operating activities in 2010 was $609.6 million lower than the 2009 period as 2010 period reflected the medical claim payments associated with the Medicare PFFS product run out. During 2009, we experienced large positive cash flows from operating activities primarily due to membership growth across the Medicare products. Investing Activities Capital expenditures in 2011 of approximately $62.1 million consisted primarily of computer hardware, software and related costs associated with the development and implementation of improved operational systems. Projected capital expenditures in 2012 of approximately $75 to $85 million consist primarily of computer hardware, software and other equipment. Net cash from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 was an outflow primarily due to a large amount of investment purchases during the period. This outflow was partially offset by the proceeds received from the sales and maturities of investments. Financing Activities Net cash from financing activities was an outflow, primarily due to share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2011 and the repayment of the $380.0 million outstanding balance on the previous revolving credit facility, partially offset by the proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes, net of discount and issuance costs. Our Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase or in private transactions. As a part of this program, 10.7 million shares were purchased in 2011 at an aggregate cost of $327.7 million, no shares were repurchased in 2010 and 1.5 million shares were purchased in 2009 at an aggregate cost of $30.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, the total remaining common shares we are authorized to repurchase under this program is 16.5 million. Excluded from these share repurchase program amounts are shares purchased in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding obligations as these purchases are not part of the program. 48 Table of Contents On June 22, 2011, we entered into a five year revolving credit facility agreement in the principal amount of $750.0 million. As of December 31, 2011, there were no amounts outstanding under this credit facility. In January 2012, at maturity, we repaid the $233.9 million outstanding balance of our 5.875% Senior Notes. For more information, refer to Note L, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. Health Plans Our regulated HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from our regulated entities. During 2011, we received $489.4 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries and we made $122.0 million in capital contributions to them. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has proposed that states adopt risk based capital (RBC) standards which are a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. Our health plans are required to submit a RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which we operate health plans have adopted a RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level, which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC. Some states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes our statutory reserve information, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions, except percentage data). 2011 2010 (unaudited) Regulated capital and surplus $ 1,903.1 $ 1,902.4 200% of RBC (1) $ 697.9 $ 671.5 Excess capital and surplus above 200% of RBC (1) $ 1,205.2 $ 1,230.9 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC (1) 545 % 567 % Statutory deposits $ 74.0 $ 79.9 (1) RBC amounts are not audited. The decrease in capital and surplus for our regulated subsidiaries primarily resulted from dividends paid to the parent company partially offset by net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company. We believe that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding our equity method investments, we had cash and investments of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase primarily resulted from the issuance of the 2021 Notes discussed previously, dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries, and earnings generated from our non regulated entities. This is partially offset by share repurchases, repayment of debt related to our revolving credit facility, a cash payment related to the provider class action litigation in Louisiana and capital contributions made by the parent company. 49 Table of Contents Other As of December 31, 2011, we were contractually obligated to make the following payments during the next five years and thereafter (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Senior notes $ 1,821,080 $ 233,903 $ 375,097 $ 228,845 $ 983,235 Interest payable on senior notes 562,887 100,021 186,301 118,014 158,551 Operating leases 145,661 31,098 47,521 30,888 36,154 Total contractual obligations 2,529,628 365,022 608,919 377,747 1,177,940 Less sublease income (3,666 ) (1,496 ) (1,203 ) (891 ) (76 ) Net contractual obligations $ 2,525,962 $ 363,526 $ 607,716 $ 376,856 $ 1,177,864 The table above does not reflect the timing of cash payments related to income taxes or legal contingencies.

We have typically paid 90% to 95% of medical claims within six months of the date incurred and approximately 99% of medical claims within nine months of the date incurred. We believe medical claims liabilities are short term in nature and therefore do not meet the listed criteria for classification as contractual obligations and, accordingly, have been excluded from the table above. As of December 31, 2011, we had $85.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits. The above table excludes these amounts due to uncertainty of timing and amounts regarding future payments. Other Disclosures Legislation and Regulation As a managed health care company, we are subject to extensive government regulation of our products and services. The laws and regulations affecting our industry generally give state and federal regulatory authorities broad discretion in their exercise of supervisory, regulatory and administrative powers. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the benefit of the members of the health plans. Managed care laws and regulations vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and changes are frequently considered and implemented. Likewise, interpretations of these laws and regulations are also subject to change. The full effect of any current or future legislation provisions adopted at the state or federal level cannot be accurately predicted at this time. See Government Regulation under Part I, Item 1, Business, for additional discussion of government regulation that affects our businesses. Inflation In recent years, health care cost inflation has exceeded the general inflation rate. To reduce the effect of health care cost inflation on our business operations in which we assume underwriting risk, we have, where possible, increased premium rates and implemented cost control measures in our patient care management and provider contracting. We cannot be certain that we will be able to increase future premium rates at a rate that equals or exceeds the health care cost inflation rate or that our other cost control measures will be effective. 50 Table of Contents 2012 Outlook Health Plan and Medical Services Division We expect our Commercial Risk membership to decline slightly in 2012 as compared to our approximately 1.6 million members as of year end 2011. The forecasted Commercial MLR is expected to be in the range of 81.0% to 82.0%, consistent with the 2011 MLR of 81.6%. For our Medicare Advantage CCP product, we anticipate growth of approximately 25,000 members in early 2012, as compared to year end 2011. We expect the 2012 Medicare Advantage MLR to be in the low to mid 80%s, consistent with the 2011 MLR of 82.9%. For our Medicaid business, we are forecasting 2012 membership to be approximately 950,000, with an MLR of approximately 90%. The expected membership growth is primarily due to the Childrens Mercys Family Health Partners acquisition effective January 2012. For additional information regarding the acquisition, see Note T, Subsequent Events, to the consolidated financial statement, which is incorporated herein by reference. Specialized Managed Care Division We anticipate membership in our Medicare Part D product to increase by nearly 300,000 members in early 2012, from 1.1 million members as of year end 2011, with continued growth throughout 2012. This increase reflects the addition of eight auto assign regions as well as membership gains driven by an increase in product offerings from two in 2011 to three in 2012. Our MLR expectation for 2012 is in the low to mid 80%s. Workers Compensation Division We expect our Workers Compensation Division revenue, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expense will decrease in 2012 driven by the loss of a customer account. We expect the gross margin for this division to be down by 2% to 5% due to the account loss. Other We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to be in a range of $2.13 billion to $2.16 billion. We expect our effective tax rate will range from 36.7% to 37.3% for 2012. 51 Table of Contents Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Under an investment policy approved by our Board of Directors, we invest primarily in marketable U.S. government and agency, state, municipal, mortgage backed and asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade. Our Investment Policy and Guidelines generally do not permit the purchase of equity type investments or fixed income securities that are below investment grade. Our investment guidelines include a permitted exception to allow for such investments if those investments are obtained through a business combination and, if in our best interest, such investments were not disposed within 90 days after acquisition. As described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we acquired investments in an equipment leasing limited liability company through our acquisition of First Health Group Corporation (FHGC). We have classified all of our investments as available for sale. We are exposed to certain market risks including interest rate risk and credit risk. We have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments. Our policies include an emphasis on credit quality and the management of our portfolios duration and mix of securities. We believe our investment portfolio is diversified and currently expect no material loss to result from the failure to perform by the issuers of the debt securities we hold. The mortgage backed securities are insured by several associations, including Government National Mortgage Administration, Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. We invest primarily in fixed income securities. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other than temporary. In making that determination, we consider all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, the following: the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area; the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security; the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future; failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency; recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if we have decided to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. For debt securities, if we intend to either sell or determine that we will more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, we recognize the entire impairment in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other cases, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. For more information concerning other than temporary impaired investments see Note G, Investments, to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10 K, which is incorporated herein by reference. 52 Table of Contents Our investments at December 31, 2011 mature according to their contractual terms, as follows, in thousands (actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights): Amortized Fair As of December 31, 2011 Cost Value Maturities: Within 1 year $ 315,362 $ 317,067 1 to 5 years 984,503 1,006,221 5 to 10 years 536,577 574,207 Over 10 years 797,061 832,704 Total $ 2,633,503 2,730,199 Equity method investments (1) 21,315 Total short term and long term securities $ 2,751,514 (1) Includes investments in entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting and therefore are presented at their carrying value. Our projections of hypothetical net gains (losses) in fair value of our market rate sensitive instruments, should potential changes in market rates occur, are presented below. The projections are based on a model, which incorporates effective duration, convexity and price to forecast hypothetical instantaneous changes in interest rates of positive and negative 100 and 200 basis points. The model only takes into account the fixed income securities in the portfolio and excludes all cash. While we believe that the potential market rate change is reasonably possible, actual results may differ.
