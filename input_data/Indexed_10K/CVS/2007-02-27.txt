Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We refer you to the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which includes our Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward Looking Statements at the end of such section, on pages 18 through 27 of our Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, which is incorporated by reference herein. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk During the third quarter of 2006, the Company refinanced a portion of the short term borrowings issued to finance the acquisition of the Standalone Drug Business, with $800 million of 5.75% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2011 and $700 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due August 15, 2016. To manage a portion of the risk associated 21 with changes in market interest rates, during the second quarter of 2006, the Company entered into forward starting pay fixed rate swaps (the Swaps), with a notional amount of $750 million. The Swaps settled during the third quarter of 2006 in conjunction with the placement of the longer term financing. As of September 30, 2006, the Company had no freestanding derivatives in place. In consideration of the execution of the share repurchase upon consummation of the merger with Caremark, the Company expects to enter into a $1.25 billion, five year unsecured back up credit facility. In addition the Company anticipates entering into a facility, which will act as a bridge facility, with a value of $5.0 billion. The Company expects the bridge facility will terminate upon the placement of longer term financing. As of December 30, 2006, the Company had no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in place and believes that its exposure to market risk associated with other financial instruments, principally interest rate risk inherent in its debt portfolio, is not material.
