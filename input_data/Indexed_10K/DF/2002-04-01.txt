Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors." As a result of this transaction, we now own 100% of our Dairy Group. The plants divested included: (i) our Burger Dairy operations based in New Paris, Indiana; (ii) our Coburg Dairy operations based in N. Charleston, South Carolina (which was an operation of Old Dean); (iii) our Cream OWeber operations based in Salt Lake City, Utah (which was an operation of Old Dean); (iv) our Flav O Rich Dairies operations based in London, Kentucky and Bristol, Virginia; (v) our H. Meyer Dairy operations based in Cincinnati, Ohio (which was an operation of Old Dean); (vi) our Huntsville Dairy operations based in Huntsville, Alabama; (vii) our Oberlin Farms ("Dairymens") operations based in Cleveland, Ohio; (viii) our U.C. Milk ("Goldenrod") operations based in Madisonville, Kentucky (which was an operation of Old Dean); and (ix) our Velda Farms operations based in Miami, Florida and Winterhaven, Florida. The divested plants were acquired by National Dairy Holdings, LP, as assignee of DFA. 2 New Credit Facility, Increased Receivables Securitization Facility and Assumed Indebtedness We financed the cash portion of the consideration paid to the shareholders of Old Dean, as well as the cash portion of the purchase price for DFAs 33.8% interest in our Dairy Group and certain related transaction costs, primarily with borrowings under a new $2.7 billion credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility, which replaces our former parent level credit facility and the former Suiza Dairy Group credit facility, provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800.0 million to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including the financing of future acquisitions and stock buybacks, if any, subject to certain limitations contained in the credit facility documents) and two term loans in the amounts of $900.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Both term loans were fully funded at closing. No funds were borrowed under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility will expire, and the $900.0 million term loan will mature, in July 2007. The $1.0 billion term loan will mature in July 2008. Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries, except for the capital stock of Old Deans subsidiaries and the real property owned by Old Dean and its subsidiaries). The credit agreement contains various financial and other restrictive covenants as well as certain mandatory prepayment provisions, all of which are more specifically described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. An additional portion of the cash consideration paid at closing was provided by new funding under our existing receivables securitization facility. On December 21, 2001, we sold Old Deans receivables into the facility, thereby increasing the amount of the facility by $150.0 million to $400.0 million. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of Old Deans indebtedness remains outstanding after the merger, including $700.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under certain senior notes, and certain capital lease obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our indebtedness and "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors." Stock Award Plans In connection with the Old Dean acquisition, all options to purchase Old Dean stock outstanding at the time of the acquisition were automatically converted into options to purchase our stock. Upon conversion, those options represented options to purchase a total of approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock. Old Dean option holders had the right, as a result of the "change in control" triggered by our acquisition of Old Dean, to surrender their New Dean stock options to us, in lieu of exercise, in exchange for a cash payment (which payments, in many cases, exceeded the amount that the option holder could have received upon exercise), provided the options were surrendered by March 21, 2002. The holders of approximately 809,000 options exercised their surrender rights. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition, we adopted Old Deans 1989 Stock Awards Plan and reserved approximately 1.9 million shares (subject to adjustment as permitted by the plan) of our stock for issuance under that plan after the merger. Options surrendered by Old Dean optionees have been added back to the pool of shares available for issuance under the plan, as permitted by the plan. Approximately 2.6 million shares were available for issuance under that plan as of March 25, 2002. Finally, due to the increased size of our employee base, upon completion of the merger, we increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under our pre existing stock option plan from 7.5 million to 12.5 million. New Directors In connection with our acquisition of Old Dean and as required by the related merger agreement, we increased the size of our Board of Directors, effective December 21, 2001, from 10 members to 15 members. All five of the new members were nominated by Old Dean, and all served on the Board of Directors of Old Dean prior to the acquisition. All of our pre acquisition directors remain on the Board. Also pursuant to the merger agreement, Mr. Howard Dean (formerly the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dean) was named Chairman of our Board of Directors. He will remain as Chairman until his retirement (no later than June 2002), at which time Gregg Engles will re assume the role of Chairman of the Board. Mr. Engles was Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer prior to the acquisition. He is currently Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board. 3 INTEGRATION AND RATIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES As a result of our acquisition of Old Dean, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of at least $60.0 million in 2002, increasing to at least $120.0 million by the end of 2004. In early 2002, we began the process of implementing various planned cost savings initiatives necessary to achieve these savings. As part of these efforts, in February 2002, we announced the elimination of approximately 200 corporate staff positions at Old Dean. We have also closed, or announced the closure of, 4 plants since completion of the Old Dean acquisition and reduced (or intend to reduce) our workforce accordingly. We will continue to finalize and implement our initial integration and rationalization plans throughout 2002. During 2001, as part of our overall integration and cost reduction strategy in effect prior to the Old Dean acquisition, we closed 3 plants and reduced our workforce accordingly. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recently announced that part of our strategy after the Old Dean acquisition will be to divest certain non core assets. Since the completion of the Old Dean acquisition, we have sold two small non core businesses that we acquired as part of Old Deans Specialty Foods division, including a transportation business and Old Deans boiled peanut business. ANNOUNCEMENT OF STOCK SPLIT On February 21, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared a two for one split of our common stock, which will entitle shareholders of record on April 8, 2002 to receive one additional share of common stock for each share held on that date. The new shares will be issued after the market closes on April 23, 2002. As a result of the split, the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding will increase from approximately 44.7 million to approximately 89.5 million. All of the share numbers in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are presented without giving effect to the upcoming stock split. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER COMPANY Since July 1999, we have owned a 43.1% interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our primary supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. Consequently, our 2001 earnings were adversely affected. CCC has implemented several changes in an effort to return to stable profitability. However, in November 2001 CCC announced that it does not expect to see the benefits of these changes for at least several quarters. Also, as a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. Therefore, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC in the fourth quarter of 2001. In February 2002, CCCs lenders agreed to restructure CCCs credit agreement to modify the financial covenants, subject to the agreement of CCCs primary shareholders to guarantee certain of CCCs indebtedness. Because CCC is an important and valued supplier of ours, and in order to protect our interest in CCC, we agreed to provide a limited guarantee of up to $10.0 million of CCCs revolving credit indebtedness. The guaranty will expire in January 2003. Please see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our guarantee of CCCs indebtedness. See also "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations Risk Factors." PURCHASE OF MINORITY INTEREST IN SPANISH OPERATIONS In August 2001, we purchased the 25% minority interest in Leche Celta, our Spanish dairy processor, for approximately $12.6 million. We now own 100% of our European dairy operations. 4 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITH CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS Restructure of Milk Supply Arrangements The primary raw material used in our operations is raw milk. We purchase a significant portion of our raw milk requirements from DFA. We have entered into a series of supply contracts with DFA over the past several years designed to ensure a reliable source of raw milk for our plants. In December 2001, we amended our supply agreements with DFA in order to provide ourselves with greater flexibility in the procurement of raw milk. The primary modification to the supply agreements was the reduction of the termination notice period from one year to 60 days. We paid DFA approximately $28.5 million as consideration for this amendment. Because this payment related to the modification of existing agreements, we recorded the $28.5 million payment as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2001. Certain Co Packing Arrangements Prior to the completion of the Old Dean acquisition, Old Dean had a long term arrangement with Nestle pursuant to which Old Dean manufactured Nestles Coffee Mate(R) coffee creamers and Nesquik(R) single serve milks. Because these Nestle products compete directly with our International Delight(R) and Hersheys(R) milk products, we have agreed with Nestle that we will phase out manufacturing and distributing these Nestle products by the end of 2003. From 1987 through 2001, our Morningstar Foods division processed and sold Lactaid(R) brand lactose reduced milk in the western portion of the United States. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2001 due to a number of factors including primarily contractual restrictions that did not permit us to fully realize the opportunities in the lactose reduced milk category (such as the ability to satisfy our customers demands for private label lactose reduced milk). Old Dean has historically produced lactose reduced milk under the Dairy Ease(R) brand, which it licensed from a third party. In November 2001, Old Dean bought the rights to the brand. We now intend to focus our efforts in the lactose reduced category on Dairy Ease(R) and on private labels for our customers. Enron In June 1999, we entered into a contract with Enron Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten year period. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on December 1, 2001, and subsequently elected to reject our contract in its bankruptcy. Since we do not expect to be able to replace the arrangement we had with Enron, we do expect Enrons bankruptcy, and its rejection of our contract, to adversely impact our results of operations. We do not expect the impact to be material. See "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties." RECENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS During the fourth quarter of 2001, we launched single serve Hersheys(R) milks and milkshakes in plastic bottles. In January 2002, we introduced our new single serve Folgers(R) Jakada(TM) coffee beverage. CURRENT BUSINESS STRATEGY Over the next several years, we will be focused on consistently creating and maximizing shareholder value primarily through the following strategies: BE OUR CUSTOMERS SUPPLIER OF CHOICE We intend to maintain and extend our leadership position in the dairy case by continuing to provide our customers with excellent quality, service and price. We have one of the most extensive refrigerated "direct store delivery" systems in the United States, with over 6,000 routes spanning virtually the entire United States. Using this system, we have a unique capability to provide unmatched service and convenience to our customers. We intend to leverage that system to grow with our customers and increase our revenues. DELIVER OUR SYNERGY TARGETS We expect to achieve annual cost savings synergies in connection with the Old Dean acquisition of at least $60.0 million in 2002, increasing to at least $120.0 million by the end of 2004. We intend to achieve these 5 synergies by vigorously pursuing economies of scale in purchasing, product development and manufacturing and by eliminating duplicative costs. INVEST IN AND BUILD UPON OUR GROWTH PLATFORMS We believe that innovation is key to growing our sales and our profitability. Therefore, we intend to invest in and build upon our largest growth platforms, including single serve dairy based refrigerated beverages; functional beverages, including soymilk and lactose reduced milk; beverage enhancers, such as coffee creamers; and food enhancers, such as refrigerated dips and salad dressings. RATIONALIZE OUR ASSET BASE We intend to carefully examine the portfolio of assets and businesses that we acquired through the Old Dean acquisition and (i) divest non core businesses that do not fit into our long term business plans, and (ii) sell or close plants with overlapping markets or excess capacity in order to increase our efficiency, thereby lowering our cost structure. INVEST OUR CASH Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow. In addition to investing in our growth platforms, we intend to invest our capital where returns are greatest, including on acquisitions in our core lines of business, and on reductions of indebtedness. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW The dairy industry is a mature industry which has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity has resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by large grocery retailers and little to no growth in the demand for fresh milk products. Over the past decade, the dairy industry has been in the process of consolidating. As the industry has consolidated, large regional dairy processors have emerged. Consolidation has tended to raise efficiencies in the typically low margin dairy industry. However, consumption of dairy products remains flat and has even declined in some regions of the country. We believe that the consolidation trend will continue as dairy processors continue to seek to become more profitable. Also, innovation has become increasingly important as processors seek to increase consumption, sales and margins through product differentiation and branding. OPERATING DIVISIONS We currently have five operating divisions, including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, Specialty Foods, Puerto Rico and International. DAIRY GROUP We sell primarily fresh dairy products through our Dairy Group, with our product mix weighted heavily toward fluid milk. Products that we sell through our Dairy Group include: fluid milk, including flavored milks and buttermilk, ice cream and novelties, half and half and whipping cream, condensed milk, cottage cheese, sour cream, 6 yogurt, dips, coffee creamers, juice and juice drinks, and water. Our Dairy Group operates its business in a generally decentralized manner organized by geographic region, including the Northeast region, the Southeast region, the Southwest region and the Midwest region. The dairy operations of Old Dean have been operationally integrated into our Dairy Group, primarily into our Midwest region. Our Dairy Group manufactures its products in 96 plants in 33 states. For more information about plants in the Dairy Group regions, see " Item 2. Properties." Primarily due to the highly perishable nature of its products, our Dairy Group delivers its products directly from its plants or distribution warehouses to its customers in trucks that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a "direct store delivery" or "DSD" system. We have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States, with over 6,000 routes spanning virtually the entire United States. Using its DSD system, the Dairy Group also acts as distributor for certain other manufacturers of refrigerated products in certain parts of the country. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its internal sales force to a wide variety of retail and food service customers including grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, institutional food service, gas stores, schools, restaurants and hotels. The Dairy Groups customer base is large, and we are not dependent on any single customer. The Dairy Groups sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be higher in the third and fourth quarters. In 2001, our Dairy Group manufactured and marketed approximately two thirds of its dairy products under its proprietary or licensed local and regional brand names. The remaining one third of the Dairy Groups 7 products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers. Proprietary or licensed brands used in the Dairy Group include the following: NORTHEAST REGION SOUTHEAST REGION MIDWEST REGION SOUTHWEST REGION fitmilk(R) Barbers(R) Barbers(R) Adohr Farms(R) Garelick Farms(R) Broughton(R) Borden(R) (licensed brand) Alta Dena(R) kidsmilk(TM) Country Delite(R) Country Charm(R) Barbes(R) LehighValley(R) Dairy Fresh(R) Country Fresh(R) Berkeley Farms(TM) Natures Pride(TM) Deans(R) Deans(R) Borden(R) (licensed brand) Sealtest(R) Flav O Rich(R) (licensed fitmilk(R) (licensed brand) brand) Browns(TM) kidsmilk(TM) Swiss(R) Frostbite(R) Creamland(TM) Land OLakes(R) (licensed Tuscan(R) Louis Trauth(R) brand) Dairy Gold(TM) Wengerts(R) Meadowbrook(R) Liberty(R) Deans(R) Pet(R) (licensed brand) Londons(R) Foremost(TM) Reiter(R) Maplehurst(R) Gandys(R) Shenandoahs Pride(R) Mayfield(R) Hygeia(R) McArthur(R) Meadow Gold(R) Pet(R) (licensed brand) Model(R) Purity(TM) Mountain High(R) Schenkels All*Star(R) Oak Farms(R) TG Lee(R) Poudre Valley(R) Verifine(R) Prices(TM) Robinson(R) Schepps(R) Swiss(TM) Viva(R) Sales in the Dairy Group to unaffiliated customers totaled $5.1 billion in 2001. For more financial information about our Dairy Group, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. MORNINGSTAR FOODS Morningstar Foods sells primarily extended shelf life (or "ESL") fluid, aerosol and other dairy and non dairy products. Its product offerings include: dairy and non dairy coffee creamers, flavored ESL milks, lactose reduced milks and milk based beverages, soymilk, dips and dressings, aerosol whipped topping, dairy and non dairy frozen whipped topping, egg substitute, and cultured dairy products. Old Deans National Refrigerated Products (or "NRP") segment has been combined with our Morningstar division. 8 Morningstar Foods markets and sells its products primarily on a national basis to a wide variety of retail and food service outlets and in a number of foreign countries through an internal sales force and independent brokers. Morningstar Foods customer base is large, and it is not dependent on any single customer. Morningstar Foods products tend to have a longer shelf life than those produced in our Dairy Group. Therefore, its products are delivered primarily by common carrier; although some of its products are distributed through our Dairy Groups DSD system. Sales of some of Morningstars products are higher in the fourth quarter. Morningstar Foods manufactures its products in 15 plants located across the United States. For more information about Morningstar Foods manufacturing plants, see " Item 2. Properties." In 2001, Morningstar Foods manufactured and marketed approximately 40% of its products under its proprietary or licensed national brand names. The remaining 60% of Morningstar Foods products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers. Morningstar Foods nationally branded products include, among others: International Delight(R) coffee creamers, Maries(R) dips and salad dressings, Mocha Mix(R) non dairy coffee creamer, Naturally Yours(TM) sour cream, Second Nature(R) eggs, Sun Soy(R) soymilk, Dairy Ease(R) lactose free milks, Deans(R) dips and dressings and Dairy Fresh(R) aerosol whipped toppings. Products that we produce under licensed brands include: Hersheys(R) milks, Folgers(R) Jakada(TM) chilled coffee beverage, Farm Rich(R) coffee creamers, Coffee Rich(R) coffee creamers and Yoo Hoo(R) chocolate milk drink. Sales in Morningstar Foods to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $766.9 million in 2001. For more financial information about Morningstar Foods, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. SPECIALTY FOODS Our Specialty Foods group is comprised entirely of the former Specialty Foods segment of Old Dean. Our Specialty Foods group offers a diverse product mix that includes pickles, relishes, peppers, powdered coffee creamers and other powdered products, sauces, puddings and nutritional beverages. Our Specialty Foods division is one of the largest pickle processors and marketers in the United States. Its pickle, relish and pepper products are sold nationally, primarily under various customer brands, but are also sold under some of our proprietary brands including Arnolds(R), Atkins(R), Cates(R), Dailey(R), Heifetz(R), Nalleys(R), Paramount(R), Peter Piper(R), Rainbo(R), Roddenberry(R) and Schwartz(R), and marketed and distributed to grocery store chains, wholesalers and foodservice customers, and in bulk to other food processors. Specialty Foods produces a number of specialty sauces, including shrimp, seafood, tarter, horseradish, chili and sweet and sour sauces, and sells them to retail grocers in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southern United States. These products are sold under the Bennetts(R) and Hoffman House(R) brand names. Specialty Foods also sells shortening powders and other high fat formulas used in baking, beverage mixes, gravies and sauces, and premium and low fat powdered products sold primarily under private labels to vending operators, office beverage service companies and institutional foodservice distributors with national distribution to restaurants, schools, health care institutions, hotels and vending and fast food operators. Non dairy creamers are sold for private label distribution to all classes of the retail trade and sold in bulk to a number of other food companies for use as an ingredient in their food products. Powdered products are sold to international customers in Australia, Canada, the Far East, Mexico, South America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We believe that our Specialty Foods segment is the largest manufacturer of powdered non dairy coffee creamers in the United States. Other products produced by Specialty Foods include various aseptic sauces, puddings and weight loss and nutritional beverages. These products are sterilized under a process which allows storage for prolonged periods 9 without refrigeration. Aseptic products are sold nationally, primarily under private labels, to distributors that supply restaurants, schools, hotels and other segments of the foodservice and grocery industries. Due to their relatively long shelf lives, Specialty Foods products are delivered to our customers stores and warehouses primarily by common carrier. Specialty Foods produces its products in 13 plants located across the United States, as well as one plant in England. For more information about Specialty Foods manufacturing plants, see " Item 2. Properties." Specialty Foods sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $18.7 million between December 21, 2001 and December 31, 2001. PUERTO RICO We have a strong dairy operation on the island of Puerto Rico, operated under the name "Suiza Dairy." Suiza Dairy sells primarily fresh dairy products with its product mix weighted heavily toward fluid milk and juice drinks. We have 3 plants across the island. For more information about our Puerto Rico properties, see " Item 2. Properties." Suiza Dairy delivers its products through a DSD system. It sells its products through an internal sales force to a wide variety of retail and food service customers including grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, institutional food service, gas stores, schools, restaurants and hotels. In 2001, Suiza Dairy manufactured and marketed over 95% of its products under its proprietary brand names. The remaining products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers. Puerto Ricos sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $221.8 million in 2001. INTERNATIONAL Our international dairy operations consist solely of our Spanish operations conducted through Leche Celta. Leche Celta sells primarily ultra high temperature ("UHT") fluid milk. Leche Celta manufactures its products in 4 plants located in the Galicia and Cantabria regions of Spain. For more information about Leche Celtas plants, see " Item 2. Properties." Leche Celta delivers its products primarily through independent trucking companies delivering directly to our customers warehouses. It sells its products through an internal sales force to a wide variety of customers, including mainly large and mid sized retailers. In 2001, Leche Celta manufactured and marketed approximately 60% of its products under its proprietary brands, and the remaining 40% under private label brands for customers. Leche Celtas sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $171.0 million in 2001. RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLY The primary raw materials used in our operations are raw milk and butterfat. We purchase our raw milk and butterfat from independent farmers and farmers co operatives, typically pursuant to contractual arrangements. Raw milk and butterfat are generally readily available. The prices of raw milk and butterfat in the United States are regulated by the federal government through federal market orders and price support programs, and many state and other governments regulate raw milk and butterfat pricing through their own programs. For more information about raw milk and butterfat pricing in the United States, please see " Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation." Prices of raw milk and butterfat can fluctuate widely. We purchase cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers. We supply seeds and advise growers regarding planting techniques. We also monitor and arrange for the control of insects, direct the harvest and, for some crops, provide automated harvesting services. Other raw materials, such as coffee, juice concentrates, sweeteners, syrups, oils and packaging supplies are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. 10 Certain of our raw materials are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of our raw materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand. COMPETITION Our businesses are highly competitive. We have many competitors in each of our major product, service and geographic markets. Competition in our businesses is based primarily on: service, price, brand recognition, quality, and breadth of product line. GOVERNMENT REGULATION PUBLIC HEALTH As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food safety regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). This comprehensive regulatory scheme governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorize regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing of dairy manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. In December 2001, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives approved two bioterrorism bills intended to improve our countrys readiness for a chemical or biological attack. Both bills contain food security provisions which would significantly expand the legal authority of the FDA with respect to foods and create additional grounds for finding violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If enacted, such legislation could increase administrative requirements and increase the costs of operating our businesses. We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients and finished products. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe that our facilities and manufacturing practices comply with all material government regulations. EMPLOYEE SAFETY REGULATIONS We are subject to certain health and safety regulations including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, 11 health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We are subject to various environmental regulations. Ammonia, a refrigerant used extensively in our operations, is considered an "extremely" hazardous substance pursuant to U.S. federal environmental laws due to its toxicity. Also, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels permitted under local regulations. Because of this, certain of our subsidiaries are required to pay waste water surcharges or to construct waste water pretreatment facilities. To date, such waste water surcharges have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We maintain above ground or underground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. These tanks are periodically inspected to determine compliance with applicable regulations. We may be required to make expenditures from time to time in order to maintain compliance of these tanks. We do not expect environmental compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. MILK INDUSTRY REGULATION The federal government and several state agencies establish minimum prices that we must pay to producers for raw milk and butterfat. These prices, which are calculated by economic formula based on supply and demand, vary by region and by the type of product manufactured using the raw product. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into fluid milk products) and Class II skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government by the 23rd day of the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices for each month are announced on the 5th day after the end of that month. Some states have opted out of the federal pricing system, and have established their own methods of establishing minimum prices for raw milk and butterfat. A very few states also regulate the price that we can charge our retail customers for our products. From 1996 until its expiration in October 2001, the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission set a minimum price for raw milk in New England independent of the price set by the federal milk marketing orders. Under that compact, the price we paid for raw milk in New England exceeded the price we were paying for raw milk in other parts of the country. The Northeast Dairy compact expired by its terms on October 31, 2001. However, in replacement of the compact, certain members of Congress have proposed legislation that would establish a minimum Class I floor price, with a regional differential added to the floor price to be paid into a national pooling system. We do not know whether this or any other legislation raising minimum prices will be enacted by Congress or, if enacted, the extent to which these compacts would increase the prices we pay for raw milk. In Spain, the government has established a quota system regulating the amount of milk that can be sold by individual farmers and farm cooperatives, which affects the manner in which we purchase raw milk, as well as the prices we pay for raw milk. 12 EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2001 we employed over 31,000 people in the following categories: NO. OF EMPLOYEES % OF TOTAL Dairy Group................................................ 24,709 78.4% Morningstar Foods.......................................... 2,350 7.5 Specialty Foods............................................ 2,869 9.1 Puerto Rico................................................ 981 3.1 International.............................................. 242 0.8 Corporate(1)............................................... 352(1) 1.1 Total............................................ 31,503 100.0% (1) In February 2002, we announced the elimination of approximately 200 corporate staff positions at Old Dean. MINORITY HOLDINGS We own a 43.1% interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. We have owned that interest since July 1999 when we sold our U.S. plastic packaging operations to CCC. Vestar Capital Partners controls CCC through a 50.9% ownership interest. The remaining 6% of CCC is owned indirectly by Alan Bernon, a member of our Board of Directors, and his brother Peter Bernon. Pursuant to our agreements with Vestar, we control 2 of the 7 seats on CCCs Management Committee. We have also entered into various supply agreements with CCC pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase certain of our requirements for plastic bottles and bottle components from CCC. In 2001, we spent approximately $95.4 million on products purchased from CCC. Because CCC has issued certain senior notes, CCC files annual, quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about CCC can be found on its website at www.cccllc.com or in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in CCC. In February 2002, we executed a limited guaranty of up to $10.0 million of CCCs revolving credit debt. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the guaranty. We own a 13.2% interest in Horizon Organic Holding Company, Americas largest organic food company. Horizon sells a full line of branded organic products, including milk, half and half, cheese, butter, yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese and juices. Horizons common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "HCOW." Pursuant to our agreement with Horizon, we control one seat on Horizons Board of Directors. We have an agreement with Horizon pursuant to which we have a right of first negotiation in the event the Board of Directors of Horizon decides to sell the company. We also have co packing agreements with Horizon pursuant to which we manufacture products for Horizon and which prohibit us from competing with Horizon in certain territories with respect to certain types of organic dairy products. Our co packing fees from Horizon totaled approximately $6.3 million in 2001. More information about Horizon can be found on its website at www.horizonorganic.com or in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in Horizon. One of our subsidiaries, Dean Dip and Dressing, owns a 37.2% interest in White Wave, Inc. White Wave is the maker of Silk(R) soymilks, soy coffee creamers and soy cultured products, as well as certain tofu products. The remaining 62.8% of White Wave is owned by individual shareholders who are not affiliated with us, including members of the White Wave management team. Pursuant to our agreement with White Wave and its individual shareholders, we have the option to purchase the remaining interest in White Wave for a discounted appraised value, beginning in September 2002. Also pursuant to our agreement with White Wave 13 and its individual shareholders, we have the right to elect 2 of the 7 members of White Waves Board of Directors. In June 2001, White Wave filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Colorado claiming that our acquisition of Old Dean was an impermissible transfer of the White Wave shares by Dean Dip and Dressing. White Wave also claimed that such transfer triggered a right of first refusal under our agreements with White Wave, entitling White Waves other shareholders to buy the shares of White Wave held by Dean Dip and Dressing. On December 5, 2002, the District Court of Colorado denied White Waves claims, ruling in our favor and holding that White Wave had no such right of first refusal as a result of our acquisition of Old Dean. On December 17, 2001, White Wave appealed the decision of the District Court of Colorado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. This appeal is currently pending. We intend to vigorously pursue this litigation, but there can be no assurance as to how the court will rule. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in White Wave. We own a 50.0% interest in a joint venture known as Dairy Marketing Alliance. The remaining 50.0% of Dairy Marketing Alliance is owned by Land OLakes, Inc., a Minnesota cooperative corporation. The purpose of the joint venture is to develop and market Land OLakes(R) brand value added dairy products, initially including creams, sour creams and milk beverages. The joint venture has a royalty free license from Land OLakes Cooperative corporation to use certain Land OLakes(R) trademarks in connection with the sale of milk in small bottles, creams, sour cream and whipping cream. The joint venture has granted to us a royalty bearing sublicense to utilize the Land OLakes(R) trademarks in the manufacture and sale of these products in certain parts of the United States through December 31, 2005. Our interest in this venture was owned by Old Dean prior to our acquisition of Old Dean. We also own a 15.6% interest in Momentx, Inc. Momentx is the owner and operator of dairy.com, an online vertical exchange focused on bringing farmers, farm cooperatives, processors and manufacturers together in an electronic marketplace for the exchange of goods and services, supply chain efficiency tools and dairy farm optimization tools. The remaining interests in Momentx are owned by various other dairy processing companies, dairy cooperatives and certain other individual investors who are not affiliated with us. Pursuant to Momentx shareholder agreements, the founding stockholders, of which we are one, are entitled collectively to elect 4 of the 7 seats on Momentx Board of Directors. Gregg Engles, our Chief Executive Officer, is Chairman of the Board of Momentx. We are also a user of dairy.coms services and in 2001 we spent approximately $0.1 million on services purchased from Momentx. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in Momentx.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are the leading processor and distributor of fresh milk and other dairy products in the United States and a leader in the specialty foods industry. We have five operating divisions including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, Specialty Foods, Puerto Rico and International. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business" for a general description of our business. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, three of our operating divisions are separately reportable business segments: Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2001 Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2001" for a description of recent developments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain information concerning our results of operations, including information presented as a percentage of net sales. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Net sales....................... $6,230,116 100.0% $5,756,303 100.0% $4,481,999 100.0% Cost of sales................... 4,750,100 76.2 4,330,067 75.2 3,487,075 77.8 Gross profit.................... 1,480,016 23.8 1,426,236 24.8 994,924 22.2 Operating costs and expenses: Selling and distribution...... 855,192 13.7 812,274 14.1 518,962 11.5 General and administrative.... 184,790 3.0 182,570 3.2 148,009 3.3 Amortization of intangibles... 53,349 0.9 52,441 0.9 38,513 0.9 Plant closing costs........... 9,550 0.2 3,388 0.1 12,566 0.3 Other operating (income) expense....................

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Note: We completed our acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Because Old Deans results of operations for the last few days of 2001 are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, full year comparisons may be less meaningful than they would be otherwise. Also, comparison data is not provided for our Specialty Foods segment since we owned it for only the last 10 days of the year. Segment data for Specialty Foods for the period since the acquisition are included in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. More complete segment data for Specialty Foods can be found in the transition report on Form 10 KT of Dean Holding Company for the seven month period ended December 31, 2001. Net Sales Net sales increased 8.2% to $6.23 billion during 2001 from $5.76 billion in 2000. Approximately $103.1 million of this increase was due to the acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 8.4%, or $391.3 million, in 2001, and net sales for Morningstar Foods increased 8.9%, or $62.7 million in 2001. $74.7 million and $9.7 million of these increases, respectively, are due to the sales of Old Dean being included in our results since December 21, 2001 (the date of acquisition). 21 The remaining portions of these increases were primarily due to an increase in prices charged for our products in response to higher raw milk and butterfat costs, and occurred despite a small decline in volume. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 76.2% in 2001 compared to 75.2% in 2000. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group increased to 77.1% in 2001 from 75.9% in 2000 and the cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods increased to 67.6% in 2001 from 66.8% in 2000. These increases were due to higher raw milk and butterfat costs in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 17.5% in 2001 compared to 18.4% in 2000. Included in 2001 operating costs were the following non recurring items: A gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of the 11 plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean (which gain represented the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants), An expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of America as consideration for modifications to our milk supply arrangements, Expenses of $9.6 million for plant closings, and An expense of $1.7 million resulting from the impairment in value of a water plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2000 the following non recurring expenses were included in operating costs: Litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million, and Expenses of $3.4 million for plant closings. Excluding these nonrecurring items, our operating expense ratio in 2001 was 17.6% compared to 18.2% in 2000. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group, excluding non recurring items, was 17.8% in 2001 compared to 18.3% in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to various cost savings initiatives (most of which were temporary) implemented during 2001 in response to a difficult operating environment. These initiatives resulted in lower selling and general and administrative costs during 2001. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.8% in both 2001 and 2000. Although similar cost savings initiatives were implemented at Morningstar Foods in 2001 as were implemented at the Dairy Group, their overall operating expense ratio remained steady due to higher distribution and selling expenses related to the introduction of new products. Operating Income Operating income in 2001 was $394.4 million, an increase of $26.3 million from 2000 operating income of $368.1 million. Our operating margin in 2001 was 6.3% compared to 6.4% in 2000. Excluding the nonrecurring items listed above, our operating income increased $7.7 million in 2001 to $386.7 million and our operating margin decreased to 6.2% in 2001 from 6.6% in 2000. The Dairy Groups operating margin, excluding the non recurring items, decreased to 5.1% in 2001 from 5.8% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher raw milk costs during 2001, partly offset by lower operating costs. Morningstar Foods operating margin declined to 13.6% in 2001 from 14.3% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher butterfat costs in 2001. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $29.6 million in 2001. Interest expense decreased to $101.8 million in 2001 from $112.6 million in 2000. This decrease was the result of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2001. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which relates primarily to our 43.1% minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), was a loss of $23.6 million in 2001 compared to income of $11.5 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 loss is an impairment charge of $21.1 million related to the write off of our investment in CCC. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. CCC has implemented several changes in an effort to return 22 to stable profitability. However, in November 2001 CCC announced that it did not expect to see the benefits of these changes for at least several quarters. Also, as a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. Other income and expense also includes $4.4 million of impairment charges related to two other small investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.3% in 2001 compared to 38.6% in 2000. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of a contested state tax issue during 2001. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings, which was primarily the 33.8% ownership interest of Dairy Farmers of America in our Dairy Group, increased to $31.4 million in 2001 compared to $29.9 million in 2000. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. In 2001, we also purchased the 25% minority interest of Leche Celta. We now own 100% of our Spanish operations. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with the acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result, we recognized a $4.3 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of $3.0 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early retirement of our former credit facilities. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended). Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $1.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and minority interest benefit of $0.7 million, as a charge to earnings. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased 28.4% to $5.76 billion during 2000 from $4.48 billion in 1999. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, sales increased $1.72 billion or 43.1% in 2000. Net sales for our Dairy Group increased by $1.56 billion, or 50.2%, in 2000 compared to 1999 mainly due to acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Southern Foods Group. Net sales for Morningstar Foods increased by $49.1 million, or 7.5%, in 2000 due to increased sales of higher priced products. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 75.2% in 2000 compared to 77.8% in 1999. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group decreased to 75.9% in 2000 from 79.6% in 1999. This ratio improved due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months, lower raw material costs and because Southern Foods Group, which we acquired effective January 1, 2000, has a lower cost of sales ratio than some of our other dairies because of its extensive use of direct store delivery. The customer base of Southern Foods Group is somewhat different from our other dairies, which requires Southern Foods to charge higher prices to cover higher distribution costs. The cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods improved to 66.8% from 69.0%, due to an increased emphasis on cost savings initiatives, as well as increased sales of higher priced products. 23 Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 18.4% in 2000 compared to 16.0% in 1999. The operating expense ratio at our Dairy Group was 17.9% in 2000 compared to 15.1% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher distribution costs at Southern Foods Group as a result of its extensive direct store delivery routes in rural areas, and increased distribution costs in 2000 because of higher fuel costs. These cost increases were partly offset by a $3.6 million pre tax gain in the second quarter of 2000 related to the curtailment of certain defined benefit plans. Included in operating costs for the Dairy Group in 2000 were plant closing costs of $2.1 million and litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $8.7 million. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.9% in 2000 compared to 18.2% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher marketing expenses in 2000 related to new products. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $0.5 million. Operating Income Operating income in 2000 was $368.1 million, an increase of 32.9% from 1999 operating income of $276.9 million. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, our operating income in 2000 increased $141.2 million or 62.3%. Our operating income margin increased to 6.4% in 2000 compared to 6.2% in 1999 (5.7% excluding the contribution of our packaging operations in 1999). Operating margin at the Dairy Group improved to 6.2% in 2000 from 5.3% in 1999. This increase in operating income margin was due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months. Morningstar Foods operating margin improved to 14.3% in 2000 from 12.8% in 1999 due to increased sales of higher margin products. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased in 2000 by $50.3 million. Interest expense increased to $112.6 million in 2000 from $49.2 million in 1999. This increase was due to additional debt used to finance acquisitions, and also as a result of higher interest rates. Financing charges on preferred securities decreased to $33.6 million in 2000 from $38.6 million in 1999 as a result of the redemption of $100.0 million of 5.0% preferred securities held by Dairy Farmers of America in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods Group, L.P. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is primarily related to our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company, amounted to $11.5 million in 2000. These earnings included $0.8 million, representing our proportional share of a favorable adjustment to previously recorded restructuring charges at Consolidated Container Company. During 1999 we reported $2.6 million in income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily Consolidated Container Company. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.6% in 2000 compared to 39.1% during 1999. This decrease was a result of the sale of our U.S. packaging operations, which had a higher effective tax rate than our dairy operations, and certain tax saving initiatives implemented during 2000. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings increased to $29.9 million in 2000 from $8.8 million in 1999. Effective January 1, 2000 we entered into a joint venture with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA") into which we contributed our domestic fluid dairy operations and DFA contributed the operations of Southern Foods Group and their interests in certain other joint ventures with us. DFA received a 33.8% ownership interest in the joint venture, which is shown as a minority interest on our consolidated financial statements. During 1999, minority interest in earnings consisted primarily of DFA ownership interests in two smaller joint ventures: Suiza GTL, LLC and Land O Sun, LLC. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. 24 Extraordinary Gain During the first quarter of 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Critical accounting policies" are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on our historical experience. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by our external insurance brokers and actuaries. The loss development factors are subject to change based upon actual history and expected trends in costs, among other factors. Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Historically, we assessed the impairment of identifiable intangible, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset may not have been recoverable. To determine whether impairment existed, we compared the expected future net operating cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the carrying amount of the underlying assets. We would have considered a potential impairment if the recorded value of these assets exceeded the associated future net operating cash flows. Any potential impairment loss would have been measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value of assets would have been measured by market value, if an active market existed, or by a forecast of expected future net operating cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" became effective and as a result, goodwill will no longer be amortized. We recorded approximately $45.5 million of goodwill amortization in 2001. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform a transitional impairment assessment of our goodwill in 2002 and annual impairment tests thereafter. As of December 31, 2001, we had $2.95 billion of unamortized goodwill included on our balance sheet. Under SFAS 142, any identifiable intangibles with an indefinite life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. 25 Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair value of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. For significant acquisitions, we utilize valuation specialists and appraisers to assist in the determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including identifiable intangibles. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Emerging Issues Task Force (the "Task Force") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board has reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," which becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2002. This issue addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that have the effect of reducing the price of a product or service to a customer at the point of sale. Our current accounting policy for recording sales incentives within the scope of this issue is to record estimated coupon expense based on historical coupon redemption experience which is consistent with the requirements of this issue. Therefore, our adoption of this issue will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2001, the Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products." We will adopt this Issue in the first quarter of 2002, as required. Under this Issue, certain consideration paid to our customers (such as slotting fees) will be required to be classified as a reduction of revenue, rather than recorded as an expense. Adoption of this Issue will result in the reclassification of certain costs; however, there will be no change in reported net income. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations. Under the new standard, all business combinations entered into after June 30, 2001 are to be accounted for by the purchase method. We have applied the provisions of SFAS No. 141 to all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of Old Dean. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead requires a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and annual impairment tests thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss resulting from the adoption will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in our income statement. We are currently in the process of completing the transitional impairment assessment and any impact on our financial statements. We must complete the first step of this test to determine if we have an impairment by June 30, 2002 and, if we have an impairment, we must complete the final step and record any impairment by December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also requires that recognized intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. As part of the adoption, we are currently reassessing the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets. Any recognized intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the 26 period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. SFAS No. 143 will become effective for us in fiscal year 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" in August 2001 and it became effective for us beginning January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, provides a single, comprehensive accounting model for impairment and disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW During 2001, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations along with borrowings under our former credit facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $310.2 million for 2001 as contrasted to $297.7 million for 2000, an increase of $12.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: A decrease of $3.3 million in net income plus non cash items in 2001 as compared to 2000; and Changes in working capital components which improved by $15.8 million in 2001 compared to the previous year. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.28 billion in 2001 compared to $380.3 million in 2000, an increase of $900.2 million. Cash paid for acquisitions increased to $1.15 billion in 2001 from $336.0 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Old Dean in 2001. CURRENT DEBT OBLIGATIONS Effective December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new $2.7 billion credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800.0 million and two term loans in the amounts of $900.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Both term loans were fully funded upon closing of the Old Dean acquisition and the proceeds were used to repay debt under our former credit facilities, to repay Old Deans credit facility, to purchase DFAs ownership stake in our Dairy Group, and to pay certain other obligations. The revolving line of credit, which expires on July 15, 2007 and is to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including the financing of future acquisition and stock buybacks, if any, subject to certain limitations contained in the credit facility documents) was undrawn. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio (computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness to EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (computed as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense). In addition, this facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth (as defined by the agreement). The agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a change in control and certain other material adverse changes in our business. The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of our credit agreement, including interest rates, principal payment schedules and mandatory prepayment provisions. At December 31, 2001 we had outstanding borrowings of $1.9 billion under our senior credit facility. In addition, $30.4 million of letters of credit secured by the credit facility were issued but undrawn. As of December 31, 2001 approximately $769.6 million was available for future borrowings under this credit facility, 27 subject to satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the loan agreement. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. An additional portion of the cash consideration paid for the Old Dean acquisition and related transactions was provided by new funding under our existing receivables securitization facility. On December 21, 2001, we sold Old Deans receivables into the facility, thereby increasing the amount of the facility by $150.0 million to $400.0 million. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables securitization facility. In addition, certain of Old Deans indebtedness remains outstanding after the acquisition, including $700.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under certain senior notes, approximately $22.0 million of industrial development revenue bonds, and certain capital lease obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness and lease obligations at December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD INDEBTEDNESS & LEASE OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER Senior credit facility............ $1,900,000 $ 72,500 $ 145,000 $145,000 $167,500 $190,000 $1,180,000 Senior notes(1)....... 700,000 100,000 600,000 Receivables backed loan................ 400,000 400,000 Foreign subsidiary term loan........... 35,172 4,818 6,077 7,250 6,982 6,699 3,346 Other lines of credit.............. 2,317 2,317 Industrial development revenue bonds....... 28,001 455 555 555 555 555 25,326 Capital lease obligations and other............... 44,796 16,882 3,549 19,151 4,491 281 442 Operating leases...... 357,870 66,946 63,248 50,047 42,823 31,379 103,427 Totals...... $3,468,156 $163,918 $ 218,429 $622,003 $322,351 $228,914 $1,912,541 (1) Represents face value of senior notes. In addition to the letters of credit secured by our credit facility, we had at December 31, 2001 approximately $71.1 million of letters of credit with three other banks that were issued but undrawn. These were required by various utilities and government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. We do have certain other commitments and contingent obligations. Please see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these commitments and contingent obligations. We do not have any ownership interests or relationships with any special purpose entities (or "bankruptcy remote" entities), other than our ownership of the special purpose entities formed to facilitate our receivables securitization program and our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The assets and liabilities of those entities are fully reflected on our balance sheet. We have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guaranties, nor any debt or equity triggers based on our stock price or credit rating. PREFERRED SECURITIES On March 24, 1998, we issued $600.0 million of company obligated 5.5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 5.5% preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled 28 to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.5% of their liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, at a conversion price of $78.25 (equivalent to a conversion rate of .6390 shares per security). These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time after April 2, 2001 at specified amounts and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events. FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS During 2002, we intend to invest a total of approximately $250.0 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. Of this amount, we intend to spend it as follows: OPERATING DIVISION AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Dairy Group.......................................... $178.0 Morningstar Foods.................................... 50.0 Specialty Foods...................................... 12.0 Other................................................ 10.0 $250.0 We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions that are compatible with our core business strategy. Any such acquisitions, as well as any stock repurchases, will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit facility. If necessary, we believe that we have the ability to secure additional financing for our future capital requirements. KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We have recently announced that we intend to continue to make acquisitions in our core businesses and, over the next several years, to divest non core businesses. RAW MATERIAL PRICES The primary raw materials used in our operations are raw milk and butterfat. The prices we pay for these materials are regulated by the federal government, and in some cases by state and other regulatory agencies. Prices of raw milk and butterfat can be very volatile. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase and the effectiveness of a corresponding price increase to our customers, and in some cases we are contractually restrained with respect to the means and timing of implementing price increases. Also, at some point price increases do erode our volumes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our operating profit margin tends to fluctuate with the price of our raw materials. CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE Many of our customers in the airline, food service and hospitality industries have suffered decreases in sales volumes since the events of September 11 and the resulting economic climate. While we have seen some improvements in these areas, our sales to some of these customers continue to be weaker than prior to 29 September 11 and may take several months to recover. Some of our customers in the retail grocery industry have also suffered decreased sales volumes as a result of the current economic climate, and we have seen some of those customers file for bankruptcy protection in recent months. While we do not expect this trend to have a material adverse effect on our business, we do expect this trend to continue until our economy returns to more stable levels. INTEREST RATES We have hedged a portion of our variable interest rate exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements that have the effect of "converting" the hedged debt from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. Approximately 40% of our variable rate debt is currently hedged. The percentage of our total debt that is hedged will fluctuate as our debt level fluctuates. Moveover, we constantly monitor the prevailing interest rate environment, and may increase the percentage of our debt that is hedged if interest rates threaten to increase to substantially higher levels, or become more volatile. RATIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES As part of our overall integration and cost reduction strategy, we recorded plant closing and other non recurring costs during 2001, 2000 and 1999 in the amounts of $9.6 million, $3.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These charges included the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of plant closings, plant rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions. The plans included an overall reduction of 198 people in 2001, 205 people in 2000 and 315 people in 1999, who were primarily plant employees associated with the plant closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to our earnings in the period that the plan was established in detail and employee severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare the plant facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities no longer used in operations. The impairments related primarily to owned building, land and equipment at the facilities that were sold and written down to their estimated fair value. As part of our purchase price allocations, we accrued costs of $28.0 million in 2001 and $11.0 million in 2000 pursuant to plans to exit certain activities and operations of acquired businesses in order to rationalize production and reduce costs and inefficiencies. Several plants were closed in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods in 2000. We have implemented certain plans to shut down plants and administrative offices in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, which was completed on December 21, 2001. We will continue to finalize and implement our initial integration and rationalization plans related to the Old Dean acquisition and we expect to refine our estimate of costs associated with these plans. The principal components of the plans will include the following: Workforce reductions, to be charged against acquisition liabilities for these costs; Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to prepare facilities for closure; and Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes after shutdown. We do not expect any of these costs to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For more information on our restructuring and exit plans see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 TAX RATE Our 2001 tax rate was approximately 36.3%. However, we believe that our effective tax rate will increase to a range of approximately 37.0% to 38.0% over the next several years, as Old Deans tax rate was higher than our tax rate prior to the Old Dean acquisition. In addition, the 2001 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of a contested state tax issue. UTILITY COSTS In 1999, we entered into a contract with Enron Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten year period. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on December 1, 2001, and subsequently elected to reject our contract in its bankruptcy. We do not expect to be able to replace the economic benefits of our contract with Enron. Therefore, we expect our utility costs to return to market levels in the future. See " Risk Factors" for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. RISK FACTORS This report contains statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact. Most of these statements are found in Items 1, 7 and 7a of this report under the following subheadings: "Current Business Strategy," "Government Regulation," "Industry Overview," "Raw Materials and Supply," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Known Trends and Uncertainties" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES MANAGING OUR GROWTH We have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years, particularly with the acquisition of Chicago based Dean Foods Company ("Old Dean") in December 2001. This rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and our financial and operational resources, which subjects us to various risks, including among others: inability to successfully integrate or operate acquired businesses, inability to retain key customers of acquired or existing businesses, and inability to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from our increased size. The integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future may also require us to invest more capital than we expected or require more time and effort by management than we expected. If we fail to effectively manage the integration of the businesses we have acquired, particularly Old Dean, our operations and financial results will be affected, both materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our business is subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. See "Part I Item 1. Business Competition." If we fail to successfully compete against our competitors, our business will be adversely affected. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition among us and our competitors to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is particularly important to our future growth, as demand tends to be relatively flat in our industry. Moreover, as our 31 customers become larger, they will have greater purchasing leverage, and could force prices and margins, particularly for our Dairy Group, lower than current levels. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR INNOVATION EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in product innovation in an effort to increase our sales and profit margins as well as the overall consumption of dairy products. We believe that sales and profit growth through innovation is a significant source of growth for our business. The success of our innovation initiatives will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our products, of which there can be no assurance. If our innovation efforts do not succeed, or if we do not have adequate resources to invest in innovation, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk, butterfat and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand and, in some cases, governmental regulation. For more information about the pricing of raw milk, see "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply" and "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation." Prices of raw milk, butterfat and certain other raw materials used in our Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods segments can fluctuate widely over short periods of time. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance, however, as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. We were adversely affected in 2001 by raw material costs. Although raw material costs have returned to normal levels in 2002 to date, we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs. Because we deliver a majority of our products directly to our customers through our "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of gasoline. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. Also, since we lost our energy supply agreement with Enron (see "Item 1. Business Developments since January 1, 2001 Enron"), we will pay market prices for electricity in the foreseeable future. As we are a significant consumer of electricity, any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources." We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results. If we do not comply with the 32 financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies. LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF OUR LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Hersheys(R), Borden(R), Pet(R), Folgers(R) Jakada(TM), Land O Lakes(R) and others. In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR SHORTAGES OF MILK SUPPLY RELATED TO MAD COW DISEASE AND/OR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US Recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE" or "mad cow disease") in some European countries have raised public concern about the safety of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal derived products. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted to milk. However, we are still subject to risk as a result of public misperception that milk products may be affected by mad cow disease. To date, we have not seen any measurable impact on our milk sales in Spain or the United States resulting from concerns about mad cow disease. However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease, we could suffer a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect our financial results. Foot and Mouth Disease ("FMD") is a highly contagious disease of cattle, swine, sheep, goats, deer and other cloven hooved animals. FMD causes severe losses in the production of meat and milk; however, FMD does not pose a health risk to humans. While there have been several recent occurrences of FMD in Europe, the United States has been free of FMD since 1929. To date, we have not seen a measurable impact on our supply of raw milk in Spain as a result of FMD. However, should FMD become widespread in Spain, a milk supply shortage could develop, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk for our Spanish operations and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in Spain. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our Spanish customers needs, and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in Spain, our financial results in Spain could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if there is an outbreak of FMD in the United States, a shortage of raw milk could develop in the United States, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in the United States. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our U.S. customers needs and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in the United States, our consolidated financial results could be materially and adversely affected. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO DAIRY FARMERS OF AMERICA, IF WE FAIL TO OFFER THEM THE RIGHT TO SUPPLY RAW MILK TO CERTAIN OF OLD DEANS PLANTS In connection with our purchase of the minority interest in our Dairy Group, we entered into an agreement with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA"), the nations largest dairy farmers cooperative and our primary supplier of raw milk, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay to DFA liquidated damages in an amount of up to $47.0 million if we fail to offer them the right, within a specified period of time after completion of the Old Dean acquisition, to supply raw milk to certain of Old Deans plants. The amount of damages to be paid, if any, would be determined on a plant by plant basis for each Old Dean plants milk supply that is not offered to DFA, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by the plant. We would be required to pay the liquidated damages even if we were prohibited from offering the business to DFA by an injunction, restraining order or contractual obligation. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this agreement. Old Dean currently has milk supply agreements with several raw milk suppliers other than DFA. If any such supplier believes that it has rights to continue to supply Old Deans plants beyond the deadline dates contained in our agreement with DFA, and is successful in legally 33 establishing any such rights, we may be prohibited from offering DFA the right to supply certain of the Old Dean plants and, therefore, be required to pay all or a portion of the liquidated damages to DFA. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR GUARANTY OF CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER COMPANYS DEBT In February 2002, we executed a limited guarantee of certain indebtedness of Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), in which we own a 43.1% interest. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the terms of the guaranty. CCC has experienced various operational difficulties over the past 6 to 9 months, which has adversely affected its financial performance. CCCs ability to repay the guaranteed indebtedness will depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business plan, of which there can be no assurance. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as: product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverages. Although we maintain quality control programs designed to address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could result in: product withdrawals, product recalls, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. POOR WEATHER CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SPECIALTY FOODS SEGMENT Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. See "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply." Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our success depends to a large extent on the skills, experience and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of these persons could hurt our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, directors or other employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business will be adversely affected. 34 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or change of control. Our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors, divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year, permit directors to be removed only for cause, and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of our voting stock. We also have a stockholder rights plan. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events, our stockholders will be able to buy stock from us or our successor at reduced prices. These rights do not extend, however, to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors. Accordingly, this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We, like others in similar businesses, are subject to a variety of federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those regulating waste water and storm water, air emissions, storage tanks and hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Future developments, including increasingly stringent regulations, could require us to make currently unforeseen environmental expenditures. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swaps have been designated as hedges against variable interest rate exposure on loans under our senior credit facility. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements: NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE 2001 (IN MILLIONS) 4.90% to 4.93%....................................... December 2002 $275.0 6.07% to 6.24%....................................... December 2002 325.0 6.23%................................................ June 2003 50.0 6.69%................................................ December 2004 100.0 6.69% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 100.0 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75.0 These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the credit facility at the interest rates noted above until the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate derivative agreements. 35 These derivative agreements were previously designated as hedges for borrowings under our terminated Suiza Dairy Group credit facility, but were redesignated upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges for loans under Leche Celtas term loan. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes these agreements: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS 5.54% November 2003 1,500,000,000 pesetas (approximately $8.0 million as of December 31, 2001) 5.6% November 2004 2,000,000,000 pesetas (approximately $10.7 million as of December 31, 2001) We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $6.9 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes and minority interest, during 2001 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. FOREIGN CURRENCY We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound and the euro. At this time, we believe that potential losses due to foreign currency fluctuations would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 36 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Risk Factors." Stock Award Plans In connection with the Old Dean acquisition, all options to purchase Old Dean stock outstanding at the time of the acquisition were automatically converted into options to purchase our stock. Upon conversion, those options represented options to purchase a total of approximately 2.7 million shares of our stock. Old Dean option holders had the right, as a result of the "change in control" triggered by our acquisition of Old Dean, to surrender their New Dean stock options to us, in lieu of exercise, in exchange for a cash payment (which payments, in many cases, exceeded the amount that the option holder could have received upon exercise), provided the options were surrendered by March 21, 2002. The holders of approximately 809,000 options exercised their surrender rights. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition, we adopted Old Deans 1989 Stock Awards Plan and reserved approximately 1.9 million shares (subject to adjustment as permitted by the plan) of our stock for issuance under that plan after the merger. Options surrendered by Old Dean optionees have been added back to the pool of shares available for issuance under the plan, as permitted by the plan. Approximately 2.6 million shares were available for issuance under that plan as of March 25, 2002. Finally, due to the increased size of our employee base, upon completion of the merger, we increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under our pre existing stock option plan from 7.5 million to 12.5 million. New Directors In connection with our acquisition of Old Dean and as required by the related merger agreement, we increased the size of our Board of Directors, effective December 21, 2001, from 10 members to 15 members. All five of the new members were nominated by Old Dean, and all served on the Board of Directors of Old Dean prior to the acquisition. All of our pre acquisition directors remain on the Board. Also pursuant to the merger agreement, Mr. Howard Dean (formerly the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Old Dean) was named Chairman of our Board of Directors. He will remain as Chairman until his retirement (no later than June 2002), at which time Gregg Engles will re assume the role of Chairman of the Board. Mr. Engles was Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer prior to the acquisition. He is currently Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board. 3 INTEGRATION AND RATIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES As a result of our acquisition of Old Dean, we expect to achieve annual cost savings of at least $60.0 million in 2002, increasing to at least $120.0 million by the end of 2004. In early 2002, we began the process of implementing various planned cost savings initiatives necessary to achieve these savings. As part of these efforts, in February 2002, we announced the elimination of approximately 200 corporate staff positions at Old Dean. We have also closed, or announced the closure of, 4 plants since completion of the Old Dean acquisition and reduced (or intend to reduce) our workforce accordingly. We will continue to finalize and implement our initial integration and rationalization plans throughout 2002. During 2001, as part of our overall integration and cost reduction strategy in effect prior to the Old Dean acquisition, we closed 3 plants and reduced our workforce accordingly. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have recently announced that part of our strategy after the Old Dean acquisition will be to divest certain non core assets. Since the completion of the Old Dean acquisition, we have sold two small non core businesses that we acquired as part of Old Deans Specialty Foods division, including a transportation business and Old Deans boiled peanut business. ANNOUNCEMENT OF STOCK SPLIT On February 21, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors has declared a two for one split of our common stock, which will entitle shareholders of record on April 8, 2002 to receive one additional share of common stock for each share held on that date. The new shares will be issued after the market closes on April 23, 2002. As a result of the split, the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding will increase from approximately 44.7 million to approximately 89.5 million. All of the share numbers in this Annual Report on Form 10 K are presented without giving effect to the upcoming stock split. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER COMPANY Since July 1999, we have owned a 43.1% interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our primary supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. Consequently, our 2001 earnings were adversely affected. CCC has implemented several changes in an effort to return to stable profitability. However, in November 2001 CCC announced that it does not expect to see the benefits of these changes for at least several quarters. Also, as a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. Therefore, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC in the fourth quarter of 2001. In February 2002, CCCs lenders agreed to restructure CCCs credit agreement to modify the financial covenants, subject to the agreement of CCCs primary shareholders to guarantee certain of CCCs indebtedness. Because CCC is an important and valued supplier of ours, and in order to protect our interest in CCC, we agreed to provide a limited guarantee of up to $10.0 million of CCCs revolving credit indebtedness. The guaranty will expire in January 2003. Please see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our guarantee of CCCs indebtedness. See also "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations Risk Factors." PURCHASE OF MINORITY INTEREST IN SPANISH OPERATIONS In August 2001, we purchased the 25% minority interest in Leche Celta, our Spanish dairy processor, for approximately $12.6 million. We now own 100% of our European dairy operations. 4 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITH CERTAIN BUSINESS PARTNERS Restructure of Milk Supply Arrangements The primary raw material used in our operations is raw milk. We purchase a significant portion of our raw milk requirements from DFA. We have entered into a series of supply contracts with DFA over the past several years designed to ensure a reliable source of raw milk for our plants. In December 2001, we amended our supply agreements with DFA in order to provide ourselves with greater flexibility in the procurement of raw milk. The primary modification to the supply agreements was the reduction of the termination notice period from one year to 60 days. We paid DFA approximately $28.5 million as consideration for this amendment. Because this payment related to the modification of existing agreements, we recorded the $28.5 million payment as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2001. Certain Co Packing Arrangements Prior to the completion of the Old Dean acquisition, Old Dean had a long term arrangement with Nestle pursuant to which Old Dean manufactured Nestles Coffee Mate(R) coffee creamers and Nesquik(R) single serve milks. Because these Nestle products compete directly with our International Delight(R) and Hersheys(R) milk products, we have agreed with Nestle that we will phase out manufacturing and distributing these Nestle products by the end of 2003. From 1987 through 2001, our Morningstar Foods division processed and sold Lactaid(R) brand lactose reduced milk in the western portion of the United States. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 2001 due to a number of factors including primarily contractual restrictions that did not permit us to fully realize the opportunities in the lactose reduced milk category (such as the ability to satisfy our customers demands for private label lactose reduced milk). Old Dean has historically produced lactose reduced milk under the Dairy Ease(R) brand, which it licensed from a third party. In November 2001, Old Dean bought the rights to the brand. We now intend to focus our efforts in the lactose reduced category on Dairy Ease(R) and on private labels for our customers. Enron In June 1999, we entered into a contract with Enron Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten year period. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on December 1, 2001, and subsequently elected to reject our contract in its bankruptcy. Since we do not expect to be able to replace the arrangement we had with Enron, we do expect Enrons bankruptcy, and its rejection of our contract, to adversely impact our results of operations. We do not expect the impact to be material. See "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties." RECENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS During the fourth quarter of 2001, we launched single serve Hersheys(R) milks and milkshakes in plastic bottles. In January 2002, we introduced our new single serve Folgers(R) Jakada(TM) coffee beverage. CURRENT BUSINESS STRATEGY Over the next several years, we will be focused on consistently creating and maximizing shareholder value primarily through the following strategies: BE OUR CUSTOMERS SUPPLIER OF CHOICE We intend to maintain and extend our leadership position in the dairy case by continuing to provide our customers with excellent quality, service and price. We have one of the most extensive refrigerated "direct store delivery" systems in the United States, with over 6,000 routes spanning virtually the entire United States. Using this system, we have a unique capability to provide unmatched service and convenience to our customers. We intend to leverage that system to grow with our customers and increase our revenues. DELIVER OUR SYNERGY TARGETS We expect to achieve annual cost savings synergies in connection with the Old Dean acquisition of at least $60.0 million in 2002, increasing to at least $120.0 million by the end of 2004. We intend to achieve these 5 synergies by vigorously pursuing economies of scale in purchasing, product development and manufacturing and by eliminating duplicative costs. INVEST IN AND BUILD UPON OUR GROWTH PLATFORMS We believe that innovation is key to growing our sales and our profitability. Therefore, we intend to invest in and build upon our largest growth platforms, including single serve dairy based refrigerated beverages; functional beverages, including soymilk and lactose reduced milk; beverage enhancers, such as coffee creamers; and food enhancers, such as refrigerated dips and salad dressings. RATIONALIZE OUR ASSET BASE We intend to carefully examine the portfolio of assets and businesses that we acquired through the Old Dean acquisition and (i) divest non core businesses that do not fit into our long term business plans, and (ii) sell or close plants with overlapping markets or excess capacity in order to increase our efficiency, thereby lowering our cost structure. INVEST OUR CASH Our company generates a significant amount of free cash flow. In addition to investing in our growth platforms, we intend to invest our capital where returns are greatest, including on acquisitions in our core lines of business, and on reductions of indebtedness. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW The dairy industry is a mature industry which has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity has resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by large grocery retailers and little to no growth in the demand for fresh milk products. Over the past decade, the dairy industry has been in the process of consolidating. As the industry has consolidated, large regional dairy processors have emerged. Consolidation has tended to raise efficiencies in the typically low margin dairy industry. However, consumption of dairy products remains flat and has even declined in some regions of the country. We believe that the consolidation trend will continue as dairy processors continue to seek to become more profitable. Also, innovation has become increasingly important as processors seek to increase consumption, sales and margins through product differentiation and branding. OPERATING DIVISIONS We currently have five operating divisions, including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, Specialty Foods, Puerto Rico and International. DAIRY GROUP We sell primarily fresh dairy products through our Dairy Group, with our product mix weighted heavily toward fluid milk. Products that we sell through our Dairy Group include: fluid milk, including flavored milks and buttermilk, ice cream and novelties, half and half and whipping cream, condensed milk, cottage cheese, sour cream, 6 yogurt, dips, coffee creamers, juice and juice drinks, and water. Our Dairy Group operates its business in a generally decentralized manner organized by geographic region, including the Northeast region, the Southeast region, the Southwest region and the Midwest region. The dairy operations of Old Dean have been operationally integrated into our Dairy Group, primarily into our Midwest region. Our Dairy Group manufactures its products in 96 plants in 33 states. For more information about plants in the Dairy Group regions, see " Item 2. Properties." Primarily due to the highly perishable nature of its products, our Dairy Group delivers its products directly from its plants or distribution warehouses to its customers in trucks that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a "direct store delivery" or "DSD" system. We have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States, with over 6,000 routes spanning virtually the entire United States. Using its DSD system, the Dairy Group also acts as distributor for certain other manufacturers of refrigerated products in certain parts of the country. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its internal sales force to a wide variety of retail and food service customers including grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, institutional food service, gas stores, schools, restaurants and hotels. The Dairy Groups customer base is large, and we are not dependent on any single customer. The Dairy Groups sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be higher in the third and fourth quarters. In 2001, our Dairy Group manufactured and marketed approximately two thirds of its dairy products under its proprietary or licensed local and regional brand names. The remaining one third of the Dairy Groups 7 products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers. Proprietary or licensed brands used in the Dairy Group include the following: NORTHEAST REGION SOUTHEAST REGION MIDWEST REGION SOUTHWEST REGION fitmilk(R) Barbers(R) Barbers(R) Adohr Farms(R) Garelick Farms(R) Broughton(R) Borden(R) (licensed brand) Alta Dena(R) kidsmilk(TM) Country Delite(R) Country Charm(R) Barbes(R) LehighValley(R) Dairy Fresh(R) Country Fresh(R) Berkeley Farms(TM) Natures Pride(TM) Deans(R) Deans(R) Borden(R) (licensed brand) Sealtest(R) Flav O Rich(R) (licensed fitmilk(R) (licensed brand) brand) Browns(TM) kidsmilk(TM) Swiss(R) Frostbite(R) Creamland(TM) Land OLakes(R) (licensed Tuscan(R) Louis Trauth(R) brand) Dairy Gold(TM) Wengerts(R) Meadowbrook(R) Liberty(R) Deans(R) Pet(R) (licensed brand) Londons(R) Foremost(TM) Reiter(R) Maplehurst(R) Gandys(R) Shenandoahs Pride(R) Mayfield(R) Hygeia(R) McArthur(R) Meadow Gold(R) Pet(R) (licensed brand) Model(R) Purity(TM) Mountain High(R) Schenkels All*Star(R) Oak Farms(R) TG Lee(R) Poudre Valley(R) Verifine(R) Prices(TM) Robinson(R) Schepps(R) Swiss(TM) Viva(R) Sales in the Dairy Group to unaffiliated customers totaled $5.1 billion in 2001. For more financial information about our Dairy Group, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. MORNINGSTAR FOODS Morningstar Foods sells primarily extended shelf life (or "ESL") fluid, aerosol and other dairy and non dairy products. Its product offerings include: dairy and non dairy coffee creamers, flavored ESL milks, lactose reduced milks and milk based beverages, soymilk, dips and dressings, aerosol whipped topping, dairy and non dairy frozen whipped topping, egg substitute, and cultured dairy products. Old Deans National Refrigerated Products (or "NRP") segment has been combined with our Morningstar division. 8 Morningstar Foods markets and sells its products primarily on a national basis to a wide variety of retail and food service outlets and in a number of foreign countries through an internal sales force and independent brokers. Morningstar Foods customer base is large, and it is not dependent on any single customer. Morningstar Foods products tend to have a longer shelf life than those produced in our Dairy Group. Therefore, its products are delivered primarily by common carrier; although some of its products are distributed through our Dairy Groups DSD system. Sales of some of Morningstars products are higher in the fourth quarter. Morningstar Foods manufactures its products in 15 plants located across the United States. For more information about Morningstar Foods manufacturing plants, see " Item 2. Properties." In 2001, Morningstar Foods manufactured and marketed approximately 40% of its products under its proprietary or licensed national brand names. The remaining 60% of Morningstar Foods products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers. Morningstar Foods nationally branded products include, among others: International Delight(R) coffee creamers, Maries(R) dips and salad dressings, Mocha Mix(R) non dairy coffee creamer, Naturally Yours(TM) sour cream, Second Nature(R) eggs, Sun Soy(R) soymilk, Dairy Ease(R) lactose free milks, Deans(R) dips and dressings and Dairy Fresh(R) aerosol whipped toppings. Products that we produce under licensed brands include: Hersheys(R) milks, Folgers(R) Jakada(TM) chilled coffee beverage, Farm Rich(R) coffee creamers, Coffee Rich(R) coffee creamers and Yoo Hoo(R) chocolate milk drink. Sales in Morningstar Foods to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $766.9 million in 2001. For more financial information about Morningstar Foods, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. SPECIALTY FOODS Our Specialty Foods group is comprised entirely of the former Specialty Foods segment of Old Dean. Our Specialty Foods group offers a diverse product mix that includes pickles, relishes, peppers, powdered coffee creamers and other powdered products, sauces, puddings and nutritional beverages. Our Specialty Foods division is one of the largest pickle processors and marketers in the United States. Its pickle, relish and pepper products are sold nationally, primarily under various customer brands, but are also sold under some of our proprietary brands including Arnolds(R), Atkins(R), Cates(R), Dailey(R), Heifetz(R), Nalleys(R), Paramount(R), Peter Piper(R), Rainbo(R), Roddenberry(R) and Schwartz(R), and marketed and distributed to grocery store chains, wholesalers and foodservice customers, and in bulk to other food processors. Specialty Foods produces a number of specialty sauces, including shrimp, seafood, tarter, horseradish, chili and sweet and sour sauces, and sells them to retail grocers in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southern United States. These products are sold under the Bennetts(R) and Hoffman House(R) brand names. Specialty Foods also sells shortening powders and other high fat formulas used in baking, beverage mixes, gravies and sauces, and premium and low fat powdered products sold primarily under private labels to vending operators, office beverage service companies and institutional foodservice distributors with national distribution to restaurants, schools, health care institutions, hotels and vending and fast food operators. Non dairy creamers are sold for private label distribution to all classes of the retail trade and sold in bulk to a number of other food companies for use as an ingredient in their food products. Powdered products are sold to international customers in Australia, Canada, the Far East, Mexico, South America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We believe that our Specialty Foods segment is the largest manufacturer of powdered non dairy coffee creamers in the United States. Other products produced by Specialty Foods include various aseptic sauces, puddings and weight loss and nutritional beverages. These products are sterilized under a process which allows storage for prolonged periods 9 without refrigeration. Aseptic products are sold nationally, primarily under private labels, to distributors that supply restaurants, schools, hotels and other segments of the foodservice and grocery industries. Due to their relatively long shelf lives, Specialty Foods products are delivered to our customers stores and warehouses primarily by common carrier. Specialty Foods produces its products in 13 plants located across the United States, as well as one plant in England. For more information about Specialty Foods manufacturing plants, see " Item 2. Properties." Specialty Foods sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $18.7 million between December 21, 2001 and December 31, 2001. PUERTO RICO We have a strong dairy operation on the island of Puerto Rico, operated under the name "Suiza Dairy." Suiza Dairy sells primarily fresh dairy products with its product mix weighted heavily toward fluid milk and juice drinks. We have 3 plants across the island. For more information about our Puerto Rico properties, see " Item 2. Properties." Suiza Dairy delivers its products through a DSD system. It sells its products through an internal sales force to a wide variety of retail and food service customers including grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, institutional food service, gas stores, schools, restaurants and hotels. In 2001, Suiza Dairy manufactured and marketed over 95% of its products under its proprietary brand names. The remaining products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers. Puerto Ricos sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $221.8 million in 2001. INTERNATIONAL Our international dairy operations consist solely of our Spanish operations conducted through Leche Celta. Leche Celta sells primarily ultra high temperature ("UHT") fluid milk. Leche Celta manufactures its products in 4 plants located in the Galicia and Cantabria regions of Spain. For more information about Leche Celtas plants, see " Item 2. Properties." Leche Celta delivers its products primarily through independent trucking companies delivering directly to our customers warehouses. It sells its products through an internal sales force to a wide variety of customers, including mainly large and mid sized retailers. In 2001, Leche Celta manufactured and marketed approximately 60% of its products under its proprietary brands, and the remaining 40% under private label brands for customers. Leche Celtas sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $171.0 million in 2001. RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLY The primary raw materials used in our operations are raw milk and butterfat. We purchase our raw milk and butterfat from independent farmers and farmers co operatives, typically pursuant to contractual arrangements. Raw milk and butterfat are generally readily available. The prices of raw milk and butterfat in the United States are regulated by the federal government through federal market orders and price support programs, and many state and other governments regulate raw milk and butterfat pricing through their own programs. For more information about raw milk and butterfat pricing in the United States, please see " Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation." Prices of raw milk and butterfat can fluctuate widely. We purchase cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers. We supply seeds and advise growers regarding planting techniques. We also monitor and arrange for the control of insects, direct the harvest and, for some crops, provide automated harvesting services. Other raw materials, such as coffee, juice concentrates, sweeteners, syrups, oils and packaging supplies are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. 10 Certain of our raw materials are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of our raw materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand. COMPETITION Our businesses are highly competitive. We have many competitors in each of our major product, service and geographic markets. Competition in our businesses is based primarily on: service, price, brand recognition, quality, and breadth of product line. GOVERNMENT REGULATION PUBLIC HEALTH As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food safety regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). This comprehensive regulatory scheme governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorize regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing of dairy manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. In December 2001, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives approved two bioterrorism bills intended to improve our countrys readiness for a chemical or biological attack. Both bills contain food security provisions which would significantly expand the legal authority of the FDA with respect to foods and create additional grounds for finding violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. If enacted, such legislation could increase administrative requirements and increase the costs of operating our businesses. We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients and finished products. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe that our facilities and manufacturing practices comply with all material government regulations. EMPLOYEE SAFETY REGULATIONS We are subject to certain health and safety regulations including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, 11 health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We are subject to various environmental regulations. Ammonia, a refrigerant used extensively in our operations, is considered an "extremely" hazardous substance pursuant to U.S. federal environmental laws due to its toxicity. Also, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels permitted under local regulations. Because of this, certain of our subsidiaries are required to pay waste water surcharges or to construct waste water pretreatment facilities. To date, such waste water surcharges have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We maintain above ground or underground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. These tanks are periodically inspected to determine compliance with applicable regulations. We may be required to make expenditures from time to time in order to maintain compliance of these tanks. We do not expect environmental compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. MILK INDUSTRY REGULATION The federal government and several state agencies establish minimum prices that we must pay to producers for raw milk and butterfat. These prices, which are calculated by economic formula based on supply and demand, vary by region and by the type of product manufactured using the raw product. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into fluid milk products) and Class II skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw milk that is processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government by the 23rd day of the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices for each month are announced on the 5th day after the end of that month. Some states have opted out of the federal pricing system, and have established their own methods of establishing minimum prices for raw milk and butterfat. A very few states also regulate the price that we can charge our retail customers for our products. From 1996 until its expiration in October 2001, the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission set a minimum price for raw milk in New England independent of the price set by the federal milk marketing orders. Under that compact, the price we paid for raw milk in New England exceeded the price we were paying for raw milk in other parts of the country. The Northeast Dairy compact expired by its terms on October 31, 2001. However, in replacement of the compact, certain members of Congress have proposed legislation that would establish a minimum Class I floor price, with a regional differential added to the floor price to be paid into a national pooling system. We do not know whether this or any other legislation raising minimum prices will be enacted by Congress or, if enacted, the extent to which these compacts would increase the prices we pay for raw milk. In Spain, the government has established a quota system regulating the amount of milk that can be sold by individual farmers and farm cooperatives, which affects the manner in which we purchase raw milk, as well as the prices we pay for raw milk. 12 EMPLOYEES As of December 31, 2001 we employed over 31,000 people in the following categories: NO. OF EMPLOYEES % OF TOTAL Dairy Group................................................ 24,709 78.4% Morningstar Foods.......................................... 2,350 7.5 Specialty Foods............................................ 2,869 9.1 Puerto Rico................................................ 981 3.1 International.............................................. 242 0.8 Corporate(1)............................................... 352(1) 1.1 Total............................................ 31,503 100.0% (1) In February 2002, we announced the elimination of approximately 200 corporate staff positions at Old Dean. MINORITY HOLDINGS We own a 43.1% interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. We have owned that interest since July 1999 when we sold our U.S. plastic packaging operations to CCC. Vestar Capital Partners controls CCC through a 50.9% ownership interest. The remaining 6% of CCC is owned indirectly by Alan Bernon, a member of our Board of Directors, and his brother Peter Bernon. Pursuant to our agreements with Vestar, we control 2 of the 7 seats on CCCs Management Committee. We have also entered into various supply agreements with CCC pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase certain of our requirements for plastic bottles and bottle components from CCC. In 2001, we spent approximately $95.4 million on products purchased from CCC. Because CCC has issued certain senior notes, CCC files annual, quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about CCC can be found on its website at www.cccllc.com or in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in CCC. In February 2002, we executed a limited guaranty of up to $10.0 million of CCCs revolving credit debt. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the guaranty. We own a 13.2% interest in Horizon Organic Holding Company, Americas largest organic food company. Horizon sells a full line of branded organic products, including milk, half and half, cheese, butter, yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese and juices. Horizons common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "HCOW." Pursuant to our agreement with Horizon, we control one seat on Horizons Board of Directors. We have an agreement with Horizon pursuant to which we have a right of first negotiation in the event the Board of Directors of Horizon decides to sell the company. We also have co packing agreements with Horizon pursuant to which we manufacture products for Horizon and which prohibit us from competing with Horizon in certain territories with respect to certain types of organic dairy products. Our co packing fees from Horizon totaled approximately $6.3 million in 2001. More information about Horizon can be found on its website at www.horizonorganic.com or in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in Horizon. One of our subsidiaries, Dean Dip and Dressing, owns a 37.2% interest in White Wave, Inc. White Wave is the maker of Silk(R) soymilks, soy coffee creamers and soy cultured products, as well as certain tofu products. The remaining 62.8% of White Wave is owned by individual shareholders who are not affiliated with us, including members of the White Wave management team. Pursuant to our agreement with White Wave and its individual shareholders, we have the option to purchase the remaining interest in White Wave for a discounted appraised value, beginning in September 2002. Also pursuant to our agreement with White Wave 13 and its individual shareholders, we have the right to elect 2 of the 7 members of White Waves Board of Directors. In June 2001, White Wave filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Colorado claiming that our acquisition of Old Dean was an impermissible transfer of the White Wave shares by Dean Dip and Dressing. White Wave also claimed that such transfer triggered a right of first refusal under our agreements with White Wave, entitling White Waves other shareholders to buy the shares of White Wave held by Dean Dip and Dressing. On December 5, 2002, the District Court of Colorado denied White Waves claims, ruling in our favor and holding that White Wave had no such right of first refusal as a result of our acquisition of Old Dean. On December 17, 2001, White Wave appealed the decision of the District Court of Colorado to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. This appeal is currently pending. We intend to vigorously pursue this litigation, but there can be no assurance as to how the court will rule. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in White Wave. We own a 50.0% interest in a joint venture known as Dairy Marketing Alliance. The remaining 50.0% of Dairy Marketing Alliance is owned by Land OLakes, Inc., a Minnesota cooperative corporation. The purpose of the joint venture is to develop and market Land OLakes(R) brand value added dairy products, initially including creams, sour creams and milk beverages. The joint venture has a royalty free license from Land OLakes Cooperative corporation to use certain Land OLakes(R) trademarks in connection with the sale of milk in small bottles, creams, sour cream and whipping cream. The joint venture has granted to us a royalty bearing sublicense to utilize the Land OLakes(R) trademarks in the manufacture and sale of these products in certain parts of the United States through December 31, 2005. Our interest in this venture was owned by Old Dean prior to our acquisition of Old Dean. We also own a 15.6% interest in Momentx, Inc. Momentx is the owner and operator of dairy.com, an online vertical exchange focused on bringing farmers, farm cooperatives, processors and manufacturers together in an electronic marketplace for the exchange of goods and services, supply chain efficiency tools and dairy farm optimization tools. The remaining interests in Momentx are owned by various other dairy processing companies, dairy cooperatives and certain other individual investors who are not affiliated with us. Pursuant to Momentx shareholder agreements, the founding stockholders, of which we are one, are entitled collectively to elect 4 of the 7 seats on Momentx Board of Directors. Gregg Engles, our Chief Executive Officer, is Chairman of the Board of Momentx. We are also a user of dairy.coms services and in 2001 we spent approximately $0.1 million on services purchased from Momentx. Please see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in Momentx.

We have five operating divisions including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, Specialty Foods, Puerto Rico and International. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business" for a general description of our business. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, three of our operating divisions are separately reportable business segments: Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2001 Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2001" for a description of recent developments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain information concerning our results of operations, including information presented as a percentage of net sales.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Note: We completed our acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Because Old Deans results of operations for the last few days of 2001 are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, full year comparisons may be less meaningful than they would be otherwise. Also, comparison data is not provided for our Specialty Foods segment since we owned it for only the last 10 days of the year. Segment data for Specialty Foods for the period since the acquisition are included in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. More complete segment data for Specialty Foods can be found in the transition report on Form 10 KT of Dean Holding Company for the seven month period ended December 31, 2001. Net Sales Net sales increased 8.2% to $6.23 billion during 2001 from $5.76 billion in 2000. Approximately $103.1 million of this increase was due to the acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 8.4%, or $391.3 million, in 2001, and net sales for Morningstar Foods increased 8.9%, or $62.7 million in 2001. $74.7 million and $9.7 million of these increases, respectively, are due to the sales of Old Dean being included in our results since December 21, 2001 (the date of acquisition). 21 The remaining portions of these increases were primarily due to an increase in prices charged for our products in response to higher raw milk and butterfat costs, and occurred despite a small decline in volume. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 76.2% in 2001 compared to 75.2% in 2000. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group increased to 77.1% in 2001 from 75.9% in 2000 and the cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods increased to 67.6% in 2001 from 66.8% in 2000. These increases were due to higher raw milk and butterfat costs in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 17.5% in 2001 compared to 18.4% in 2000. Included in 2001 operating costs were the following non recurring items: A gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of the 11 plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean (which gain represented the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants), An expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of America as consideration for modifications to our milk supply arrangements, Expenses of $9.6 million for plant closings, and An expense of $1.7 million resulting from the impairment in value of a water plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2000 the following non recurring expenses were included in operating costs: Litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million, and Expenses of $3.4 million for plant closings. Excluding these nonrecurring items, our operating expense ratio in 2001 was 17.6% compared to 18.2% in 2000. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group, excluding non recurring items, was 17.8% in 2001 compared to 18.3% in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to various cost savings initiatives (most of which were temporary) implemented during 2001 in response to a difficult operating environment. These initiatives resulted in lower selling and general and administrative costs during 2001. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.8% in both 2001 and 2000. Although similar cost savings initiatives were implemented at Morningstar Foods in 2001 as were implemented at the Dairy Group, their overall operating expense ratio remained steady due to higher distribution and selling expenses related to the introduction of new products. Operating Income Operating income in 2001 was $394.4 million, an increase of $26.3 million from 2000 operating income of $368.1 million. Our operating margin in 2001 was 6.3% compared to 6.4% in 2000. Excluding the nonrecurring items listed above, our operating income increased $7.7 million in 2001 to $386.7 million and our operating margin decreased to 6.2% in 2001 from 6.6% in 2000. The Dairy Groups operating margin, excluding the non recurring items, decreased to 5.1% in 2001 from 5.8% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher raw milk costs during 2001, partly offset by lower operating costs. Morningstar Foods operating margin declined to 13.6% in 2001 from 14.3% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher butterfat costs in 2001. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $29.6 million in 2001. Interest expense decreased to $101.8 million in 2001 from $112.6 million in 2000. This decrease was the result of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2001. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which relates primarily to our 43.1% minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), was a loss of $23.6 million in 2001 compared to income of $11.5 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 loss is an impairment charge of $21.1 million related to the write off of our investment in CCC. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. CCC has implemented several changes in an effort to return 22 to stable profitability. However, in November 2001 CCC announced that it did not expect to see the benefits of these changes for at least several quarters. Also, as a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. Other income and expense also includes $4.4 million of impairment charges related to two other small investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.3% in 2001 compared to 38.6% in 2000. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of a contested state tax issue during 2001. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings, which was primarily the 33.8% ownership interest of Dairy Farmers of America in our Dairy Group, increased to $31.4 million in 2001 compared to $29.9 million in 2000. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. In 2001, we also purchased the 25% minority interest of Leche Celta. We now own 100% of our Spanish operations. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with the acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result, we recognized a $4.3 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of $3.0 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early retirement of our former credit facilities. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended). Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $1.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and minority interest benefit of $0.7 million, as a charge to earnings. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased 28.4% to $5.76 billion during 2000 from $4.48 billion in 1999. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, sales increased $1.72 billion or 43.1% in 2000. Net sales for our Dairy Group increased by $1.56 billion, or 50.2%, in 2000 compared to 1999 mainly due to acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Southern Foods Group. Net sales for Morningstar Foods increased by $49.1 million, or 7.5%, in 2000 due to increased sales of higher priced products. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 75.2% in 2000 compared to 77.8% in 1999. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group decreased to 75.9% in 2000 from 79.6% in 1999. This ratio improved due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months, lower raw material costs and because Southern Foods Group, which we acquired effective January 1, 2000, has a lower cost of sales ratio than some of our other dairies because of its extensive use of direct store delivery. The customer base of Southern Foods Group is somewhat different from our other dairies, which requires Southern Foods to charge higher prices to cover higher distribution costs. The cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods improved to 66.8% from 69.0%, due to an increased emphasis on cost savings initiatives, as well as increased sales of higher priced products. 23 Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 18.4% in 2000 compared to 16.0% in 1999. The operating expense ratio at our Dairy Group was 17.9% in 2000 compared to 15.1% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher distribution costs at Southern Foods Group as a result of its extensive direct store delivery routes in rural areas, and increased distribution costs in 2000 because of higher fuel costs. These cost increases were partly offset by a $3.6 million pre tax gain in the second quarter of 2000 related to the curtailment of certain defined benefit plans. Included in operating costs for the Dairy Group in 2000 were plant closing costs of $2.1 million and litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $8.7 million. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.9% in 2000 compared to 18.2% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher marketing expenses in 2000 related to new products. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $0.5 million. Operating Income Operating income in 2000 was $368.1 million, an increase of 32.9% from 1999 operating income of $276.9 million. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, our operating income in 2000 increased $141.2 million or 62.3%. Our operating income margin increased to 6.4% in 2000 compared to 6.2% in 1999 (5.7% excluding the contribution of our packaging operations in 1999). Operating margin at the Dairy Group improved to 6.2% in 2000 from 5.3% in 1999. This increase in operating income margin was due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months. Morningstar Foods operating margin improved to 14.3% in 2000 from 12.8% in 1999 due to increased sales of higher margin products. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased in 2000 by $50.3 million. Interest expense increased to $112.6 million in 2000 from $49.2 million in 1999. This increase was due to additional debt used to finance acquisitions, and also as a result of higher interest rates. Financing charges on preferred securities decreased to $33.6 million in 2000 from $38.6 million in 1999 as a result of the redemption of $100.0 million of 5.0% preferred securities held by Dairy Farmers of America in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods Group, L.P. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is primarily related to our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company, amounted to $11.5 million in 2000. These earnings included $0.8 million, representing our proportional share of a favorable adjustment to previously recorded restructuring charges at Consolidated Container Company. During 1999 we reported $2.6 million in income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily Consolidated Container Company. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.6% in 2000 compared to 39.1% during 1999. This decrease was a result of the sale of our U.S. packaging operations, which had a higher effective tax rate than our dairy operations, and certain tax saving initiatives implemented during 2000. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings increased to $29.9 million in 2000 from $8.8 million in 1999. Effective January 1, 2000 we entered into a joint venture with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA") into which we contributed our domestic fluid dairy operations and DFA contributed the operations of Southern Foods Group and their interests in certain other joint ventures with us. DFA received a 33.8% ownership interest in the joint venture, which is shown as a minority interest on our consolidated financial statements. During 1999, minority interest in earnings consisted primarily of DFA ownership interests in two smaller joint ventures: Suiza GTL, LLC and Land O Sun, LLC. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. 24 Extraordinary Gain During the first quarter of 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Critical accounting policies" are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on our historical experience. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by our external insurance brokers and actuaries. The loss development factors are subject to change based upon actual history and expected trends in costs, among other factors. Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Historically, we assessed the impairment of identifiable intangible, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset may not have been recoverable. To determine whether impairment existed, we compared the expected future net operating cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the carrying amount of the underlying assets. We would have considered a potential impairment if the recorded value of these assets exceeded the associated future net operating cash flows. Any potential impairment loss would have been measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value of assets would have been measured by market value, if an active market existed, or by a forecast of expected future net operating cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" became effective and as a result, goodwill will no longer be amortized. We recorded approximately $45.5 million of goodwill amortization in 2001. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform a transitional impairment assessment of our goodwill in 2002 and annual impairment tests thereafter. As of December 31, 2001, we had $2.95 billion of unamortized goodwill included on our balance sheet. Under SFAS 142, any identifiable intangibles with an indefinite life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. 25 Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair value of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. For significant acquisitions, we utilize valuation specialists and appraisers to assist in the determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including identifiable intangibles. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Emerging Issues Task Force (the "Task Force") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board has reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," which becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2002. This issue addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that have the effect of reducing the price of a product or service to a customer at the point of sale. Our current accounting policy for recording sales incentives within the scope of this issue is to record estimated coupon expense based on historical coupon redemption experience which is consistent with the requirements of this issue. Therefore, our adoption of this issue will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2001, the Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products." We will adopt this Issue in the first quarter of 2002, as required. Under this Issue, certain consideration paid to our customers (such as slotting fees) will be required to be classified as a reduction of revenue, rather than recorded as an expense. Adoption of this Issue will result in the reclassification of certain costs; however, there will be no change in reported net income. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations. Under the new standard, all business combinations entered into after June 30, 2001 are to be accounted for by the purchase method. We have applied the provisions of SFAS No. 141 to all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of Old Dean. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead requires a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and annual impairment tests thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss resulting from the adoption will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in our income statement. We are currently in the process of completing the transitional impairment assessment and any impact on our financial statements. We must complete the first step of this test to determine if we have an impairment by June 30, 2002 and, if we have an impairment, we must complete the final step and record any impairment by December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also requires that recognized intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. As part of the adoption, we are currently reassessing the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets. Any recognized intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the 26 period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. SFAS No. 143 will become effective for us in fiscal year 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" in August 2001 and it became effective for us beginning January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, provides a single, comprehensive accounting model for impairment and disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW During 2001, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations along with borrowings under our former credit facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $310.2 million for 2001 as contrasted to $297.7 million for 2000, an increase of $12.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: A decrease of $3.3 million in net income plus non cash items in 2001 as compared to 2000; and Changes in working capital components which improved by $15.8 million in 2001 compared to the previous year. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.28 billion in 2001 compared to $380.3 million in 2000, an increase of $900.2 million. Cash paid for acquisitions increased to $1.15 billion in 2001 from $336.0 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Old Dean in 2001. CURRENT DEBT OBLIGATIONS Effective December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new $2.7 billion credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800.0 million and two term loans in the amounts of $900.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Both term loans were fully funded upon closing of the Old Dean acquisition and the proceeds were used to repay debt under our former credit facilities, to repay Old Deans credit facility, to purchase DFAs ownership stake in our Dairy Group, and to pay certain other obligations. The revolving line of credit, which expires on July 15, 2007 and is to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including the financing of future acquisition and stock buybacks, if any, subject to certain limitations contained in the credit facility documents) was undrawn. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio (computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness to EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (computed as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense). In addition, this facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth (as defined by the agreement). The agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a change in control and certain other material adverse changes in our business. The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of our credit agreement, including interest rates, principal payment schedules and mandatory prepayment provisions. At December 31, 2001 we had outstanding borrowings of $1.9 billion under our senior credit facility. In addition, $30.4 million of letters of credit secured by the credit facility were issued but undrawn. As of December 31, 2001 approximately $769.6 million was available for future borrowings under this credit facility, 27 subject to satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the loan agreement. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. An additional portion of the cash consideration paid for the Old Dean acquisition and related transactions was provided by new funding under our existing receivables securitization facility. On December 21, 2001, we sold Old Deans receivables into the facility, thereby increasing the amount of the facility by $150.0 million to $400.0 million. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables securitization facility. In addition, certain of Old Deans indebtedness remains outstanding after the acquisition, including $700.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under certain senior notes, approximately $22.0 million of industrial development revenue bonds, and certain capital lease obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness and lease obligations at December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD INDEBTEDNESS & LEASE OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER Senior credit facility............ $1,900,000 $ 72,500 $ 145,000 $145,000 $167,500 $190,000 $1,180,000 Senior notes(1)....... 700,000 100,000 600,000 Receivables backed loan................ 400,000 400,000 Foreign subsidiary term loan........... 35,172 4,818 6,077 7,250 6,982 6,699 3,346 Other lines of credit.............. 2,317 2,317 Industrial development revenue bonds....... 28,001 455 555 555 555 555 25,326 Capital lease obligations and other............... 44,796 16,882 3,549 19,151 4,491 281 442 Operating leases...... 357,870 66,946 63,248 50,047 42,823 31,379 103,427 Totals...... $3,468,156 $163,918 $ 218,429 $622,003 $322,351 $228,914 $1,912,541 (1) Represents face value of senior notes. In addition to the letters of credit secured by our credit facility, we had at December 31, 2001 approximately $71.1 million of letters of credit with three other banks that were issued but undrawn. These were required by various utilities and government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. We do have certain other commitments and contingent obligations. Please see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these commitments and contingent obligations. We do not have any ownership interests or relationships with any special purpose entities (or "bankruptcy remote" entities), other than our ownership of the special purpose entities formed to facilitate our receivables securitization program and our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The assets and liabilities of those entities are fully reflected on our balance sheet. We have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guaranties, nor any debt or equity triggers based on our stock price or credit rating. PREFERRED SECURITIES On March 24, 1998, we issued $600.0 million of company obligated 5.5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 5.5% preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled 28 to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.5% of their liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, at a conversion price of $78.25 (equivalent to a conversion rate of .6390 shares per security). These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time after April 2, 2001 at specified amounts and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events. FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS During 2002, we intend to invest a total of approximately $250.0 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. Of this amount, we intend to spend it as follows: OPERATING DIVISION AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Dairy Group.......................................... $178.0 Morningstar Foods.................................... 50.0 Specialty Foods...................................... 12.0 Other................................................ 10.0 $250.0 We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions that are compatible with our core business strategy. Any such acquisitions, as well as any stock repurchases, will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit facility. If necessary, we believe that we have the ability to secure additional financing for our future capital requirements. KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We have recently announced that we intend to continue to make acquisitions in our core businesses and, over the next several years, to divest non core businesses. RAW MATERIAL PRICES The primary raw materials used in our operations are raw milk and butterfat. The prices we pay for these materials are regulated by the federal government, and in some cases by state and other regulatory agencies. Prices of raw milk and butterfat can be very volatile. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase and the effectiveness of a corresponding price increase to our customers, and in some cases we are contractually restrained with respect to the means and timing of implementing price increases. Also, at some point price increases do erode our volumes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our operating profit margin tends to fluctuate with the price of our raw materials. CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE Many of our customers in the airline, food service and hospitality industries have suffered decreases in sales volumes since the events of September 11 and the resulting economic climate. While we have seen some improvements in these areas, our sales to some of these customers continue to be weaker than prior to 29 September 11 and may take several months to recover. Some of our customers in the retail grocery industry have also suffered decreased sales volumes as a result of the current economic climate, and we have seen some of those customers file for bankruptcy protection in recent months. While we do not expect this trend to have a material adverse effect on our business, we do expect this trend to continue until our economy returns to more stable levels. INTEREST RATES We have hedged a portion of our variable interest rate exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements that have the effect of "converting" the hedged debt from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. Approximately 40% of our variable rate debt is currently hedged. The percentage of our total debt that is hedged will fluctuate as our debt level fluctuates. Moveover, we constantly monitor the prevailing interest rate environment, and may increase the percentage of our debt that is hedged if interest rates threaten to increase to substantially higher levels, or become more volatile. RATIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES As part of our overall integration and cost reduction strategy, we recorded plant closing and other non recurring costs during 2001, 2000 and 1999 in the amounts of $9.6 million, $3.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These charges included the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of plant closings, plant rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions. The plans included an overall reduction of 198 people in 2001, 205 people in 2000 and 315 people in 1999, who were primarily plant employees associated with the plant closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to our earnings in the period that the plan was established in detail and employee severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare the plant facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities no longer used in operations. The impairments related primarily to owned building, land and equipment at the facilities that were sold and written down to their estimated fair value. As part of our purchase price allocations, we accrued costs of $28.0 million in 2001 and $11.0 million in 2000 pursuant to plans to exit certain activities and operations of acquired businesses in order to rationalize production and reduce costs and inefficiencies. Several plants were closed in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods in 2000. We have implemented certain plans to shut down plants and administrative offices in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, which was completed on December 21, 2001. We will continue to finalize and implement our initial integration and rationalization plans related to the Old Dean acquisition and we expect to refine our estimate of costs associated with these plans. The principal components of the plans will include the following: Workforce reductions, to be charged against acquisition liabilities for these costs; Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to prepare facilities for closure; and Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes after shutdown. We do not expect any of these costs to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For more information on our restructuring and exit plans see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 TAX RATE Our 2001 tax rate was approximately 36.3%. However, we believe that our effective tax rate will increase to a range of approximately 37.0% to 38.0% over the next several years, as Old Deans tax rate was higher than our tax rate prior to the Old Dean acquisition. In addition, the 2001 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of a contested state tax issue. UTILITY COSTS In 1999, we entered into a contract with Enron Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten year period. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on December 1, 2001, and subsequently elected to reject our contract in its bankruptcy. We do not expect to be able to replace the economic benefits of our contract with Enron. Therefore, we expect our utility costs to return to market levels in the future. See " Risk Factors" for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. RISK FACTORS This report contains statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact. Most of these statements are found in Items 1, 7 and 7a of this report under the following subheadings: "Current Business Strategy," "Government Regulation," "Industry Overview," "Raw Materials and Supply," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Known Trends and Uncertainties" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES MANAGING OUR GROWTH We have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years, particularly with the acquisition of Chicago based Dean Foods Company ("Old Dean") in December 2001. This rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and our financial and operational resources, which subjects us to various risks, including among others: inability to successfully integrate or operate acquired businesses, inability to retain key customers of acquired or existing businesses, and inability to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from our increased size. The integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future may also require us to invest more capital than we expected or require more time and effort by management than we expected. If we fail to effectively manage the integration of the businesses we have acquired, particularly Old Dean, our operations and financial results will be affected, both materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our business is subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. See "Part I Item 1. Business Competition." If we fail to successfully compete against our competitors, our business will be adversely affected. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition among us and our competitors to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is particularly important to our future growth, as demand tends to be relatively flat in our industry. Moreover, as our 31 customers become larger, they will have greater purchasing leverage, and could force prices and margins, particularly for our Dairy Group, lower than current levels. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR INNOVATION EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in product innovation in an effort to increase our sales and profit margins as well as the overall consumption of dairy products. We believe that sales and profit growth through innovation is a significant source of growth for our business. The success of our innovation initiatives will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our products, of which there can be no assurance. If our innovation efforts do not succeed, or if we do not have adequate resources to invest in innovation, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk, butterfat and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand and, in some cases, governmental regulation. For more information about the pricing of raw milk, see "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply" and "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation." Prices of raw milk, butterfat and certain other raw materials used in our Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods segments can fluctuate widely over short periods of time. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance, however, as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. We were adversely affected in 2001 by raw material costs. Although raw material costs have returned to normal levels in 2002 to date, we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs. Because we deliver a majority of our products directly to our customers through our "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of gasoline. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. Also, since we lost our energy supply agreement with Enron (see "Item 1. Business Developments since January 1, 2001 Enron"), we will pay market prices for electricity in the foreseeable future. As we are a significant consumer of electricity, any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources." We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results. If we do not comply with the 32 financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies. LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF OUR LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Hersheys(R), Borden(R), Pet(R), Folgers(R) Jakada(TM), Land O Lakes(R) and others. In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR SHORTAGES OF MILK SUPPLY RELATED TO MAD COW DISEASE AND/OR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US Recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE" or "mad cow disease") in some European countries have raised public concern about the safety of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal derived products. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted to milk. However, we are still subject to risk as a result of public misperception that milk products may be affected by mad cow disease. To date, we have not seen any measurable impact on our milk sales in Spain or the United States resulting from concerns about mad cow disease. However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease, we could suffer a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect our financial results. Foot and Mouth Disease ("FMD") is a highly contagious disease of cattle, swine, sheep, goats, deer and other cloven hooved animals. FMD causes severe losses in the production of meat and milk; however, FMD does not pose a health risk to humans. While there have been several recent occurrences of FMD in Europe, the United States has been free of FMD since 1929. To date, we have not seen a measurable impact on our supply of raw milk in Spain as a result of FMD. However, should FMD become widespread in Spain, a milk supply shortage could develop, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk for our Spanish operations and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in Spain. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our Spanish customers needs, and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in Spain, our financial results in Spain could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if there is an outbreak of FMD in the United States, a shortage of raw milk could develop in the United States, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in the United States. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our U.S. customers needs and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in the United States, our consolidated financial results could be materially and adversely affected. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO DAIRY FARMERS OF AMERICA, IF WE FAIL TO OFFER THEM THE RIGHT TO SUPPLY RAW MILK TO CERTAIN OF OLD DEANS PLANTS In connection with our purchase of the minority interest in our Dairy Group, we entered into an agreement with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA"), the nations largest dairy farmers cooperative and our primary supplier of raw milk, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay to DFA liquidated damages in an amount of up to $47.0 million if we fail to offer them the right, within a specified period of time after completion of the Old Dean acquisition, to supply raw milk to certain of Old Deans plants. The amount of damages to be paid, if any, would be determined on a plant by plant basis for each Old Dean plants milk supply that is not offered to DFA, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by the plant. We would be required to pay the liquidated damages even if we were prohibited from offering the business to DFA by an injunction, restraining order or contractual obligation. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this agreement. Old Dean currently has milk supply agreements with several raw milk suppliers other than DFA. If any such supplier believes that it has rights to continue to supply Old Deans plants beyond the deadline dates contained in our agreement with DFA, and is successful in legally 33 establishing any such rights, we may be prohibited from offering DFA the right to supply certain of the Old Dean plants and, therefore, be required to pay all or a portion of the liquidated damages to DFA. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR GUARANTY OF CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER COMPANYS DEBT In February 2002, we executed a limited guarantee of certain indebtedness of Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), in which we own a 43.1% interest. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the terms of the guaranty. CCC has experienced various operational difficulties over the past 6 to 9 months, which has adversely affected its financial performance. CCCs ability to repay the guaranteed indebtedness will depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business plan, of which there can be no assurance. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as: product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverages. Although we maintain quality control programs designed to address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could result in: product withdrawals, product recalls, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. POOR WEATHER CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SPECIALTY FOODS SEGMENT Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. See "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply." Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our success depends to a large extent on the skills, experience and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of these persons could hurt our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, directors or other employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business will be adversely affected. 34 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or change of control. Our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors, divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year, permit directors to be removed only for cause, and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of our voting stock. We also have a stockholder rights plan. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events, our stockholders will be able to buy stock from us or our successor at reduced prices. These rights do not extend, however, to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors. Accordingly, this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We, like others in similar businesses, are subject to a variety of federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those regulating waste water and storm water, air emissions, storage tanks and hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Future developments, including increasingly stringent regulations, could require us to make currently unforeseen environmental expenditures. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swaps have been designated as hedges against variable interest rate exposure on loans under our senior credit facility. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements: NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE 2001 (IN MILLIONS) 4.90% to 4.93%....................................... December 2002 $275.0 6.07% to 6.24%....................................... December 2002 325.0 6.23%................................................ June 2003 50.0 6.69%................................................ December 2004 100.0 6.69% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 100.0 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75.0 These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the credit facility at the interest rates noted above until the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate derivative agreements. 35 These derivative agreements were previously designated as hedges for borrowings under our terminated Suiza Dairy Group credit facility, but were redesignated upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges for loans under Leche Celtas term loan. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes these agreements: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS 5.54% November 2003 1,500,000,000 pesetas (approximately $8.0 million as of December 31, 2001) 5.6% November 2004 2,000,000,000 pesetas (approximately $10.7 million as of December 31, 2001) We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $6.9 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes and minority interest, during 2001 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. FOREIGN CURRENCY We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound and the euro. At this time, we believe that potential losses due to foreign currency fluctuations would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 36

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are the leading processor and distributor of fresh milk and other dairy products in the United States and a leader in the specialty foods industry. We have five operating divisions including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, Specialty Foods, Puerto Rico and International. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business" for a general description of our business. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, three of our operating divisions are separately reportable business segments: Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2001 Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2001" for a description of recent developments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain information concerning our results of operations, including information presented as a percentage of net sales.

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Note: We completed our acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Because Old Deans results of operations for the last few days of 2001 are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, full year comparisons may be less meaningful than they would be otherwise. Also, comparison data is not provided for our Specialty Foods segment since we owned it for only the last 10 days of the year. Segment data for Specialty Foods for the period since the acquisition are included in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. More complete segment data for Specialty Foods can be found in the transition report on Form 10 KT of Dean Holding Company for the seven month period ended December 31, 2001. Net Sales Net sales increased 8.2% to $6.23 billion during 2001 from $5.76 billion in 2000. Approximately $103.1 million of this increase was due to the acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 8.4%, or $391.3 million, in 2001, and net sales for Morningstar Foods increased 8.9%, or $62.7 million in 2001. $74.7 million and $9.7 million of these increases, respectively, are due to the sales of Old Dean being included in our results since December 21, 2001 (the date of acquisition). 21 The remaining portions of these increases were primarily due to an increase in prices charged for our products in response to higher raw milk and butterfat costs, and occurred despite a small decline in volume. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 76.2% in 2001 compared to 75.2% in 2000. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group increased to 77.1% in 2001 from 75.9% in 2000 and the cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods increased to 67.6% in 2001 from 66.8% in 2000. These increases were due to higher raw milk and butterfat costs in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 17.5% in 2001 compared to 18.4% in 2000. Included in 2001 operating costs were the following non recurring items: A gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of the 11 plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean (which gain represented the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants), An expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of America as consideration for modifications to our milk supply arrangements, Expenses of $9.6 million for plant closings, and An expense of $1.7 million resulting from the impairment in value of a water plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2000 the following non recurring expenses were included in operating costs: Litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million, and Expenses of $3.4 million for plant closings. Excluding these nonrecurring items, our operating expense ratio in 2001 was 17.6% compared to 18.2% in 2000. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group, excluding non recurring items, was 17.8% in 2001 compared to 18.3% in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to various cost savings initiatives (most of which were temporary) implemented during 2001 in response to a difficult operating environment. These initiatives resulted in lower selling and general and administrative costs during 2001. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.8% in both 2001 and 2000. Although similar cost savings initiatives were implemented at Morningstar Foods in 2001 as were implemented at the Dairy Group, their overall operating expense ratio remained steady due to higher distribution and selling expenses related to the introduction of new products. Operating Income Operating income in 2001 was $394.4 million, an increase of $26.3 million from 2000 operating income of $368.1 million. Our operating margin in 2001 was 6.3% compared to 6.4% in 2000. Excluding the nonrecurring items listed above, our operating income increased $7.7 million in 2001 to $386.7 million and our operating margin decreased to 6.2% in 2001 from 6.6% in 2000. The Dairy Groups operating margin, excluding the non recurring items, decreased to 5.1% in 2001 from 5.8% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher raw milk costs during 2001, partly offset by lower operating costs. Morningstar Foods operating margin declined to 13.6% in 2001 from 14.3% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher butterfat costs in 2001. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $29.6 million in 2001. Interest expense decreased to $101.8 million in 2001 from $112.6 million in 2000. This decrease was the result of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2001. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which relates primarily to our 43.1% minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), was a loss of $23.6 million in 2001 compared to income of $11.5 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 loss is an impairment charge of $21.1 million related to the write off of our investment in CCC. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. CCC has implemented several changes in an effort to return 22 to stable profitability. However, in November 2001 CCC announced that it did not expect to see the benefits of these changes for at least several quarters. Also, as a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. Other income and expense also includes $4.4 million of impairment charges related to two other small investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.3% in 2001 compared to 38.6% in 2000. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of a contested state tax issue during 2001. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings, which was primarily the 33.8% ownership interest of Dairy Farmers of America in our Dairy Group, increased to $31.4 million in 2001 compared to $29.9 million in 2000. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. In 2001, we also purchased the 25% minority interest of Leche Celta. We now own 100% of our Spanish operations. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with the acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result, we recognized a $4.3 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of $3.0 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early retirement of our former credit facilities. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended). Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $1.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and minority interest benefit of $0.7 million, as a charge to earnings. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased 28.4% to $5.76 billion during 2000 from $4.48 billion in 1999. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, sales increased $1.72 billion or 43.1% in 2000. Net sales for our Dairy Group increased by $1.56 billion, or 50.2%, in 2000 compared to 1999 mainly due to acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Southern Foods Group. Net sales for Morningstar Foods increased by $49.1 million, or 7.5%, in 2000 due to increased sales of higher priced products. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 75.2% in 2000 compared to 77.8% in 1999. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group decreased to 75.9% in 2000 from 79.6% in 1999. This ratio improved due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months, lower raw material costs and because Southern Foods Group, which we acquired effective January 1, 2000, has a lower cost of sales ratio than some of our other dairies because of its extensive use of direct store delivery. The customer base of Southern Foods Group is somewhat different from our other dairies, which requires Southern Foods to charge higher prices to cover higher distribution costs. The cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods improved to 66.8% from 69.0%, due to an increased emphasis on cost savings initiatives, as well as increased sales of higher priced products. 23 Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 18.4% in 2000 compared to 16.0% in 1999. The operating expense ratio at our Dairy Group was 17.9% in 2000 compared to 15.1% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher distribution costs at Southern Foods Group as a result of its extensive direct store delivery routes in rural areas, and increased distribution costs in 2000 because of higher fuel costs. These cost increases were partly offset by a $3.6 million pre tax gain in the second quarter of 2000 related to the curtailment of certain defined benefit plans. Included in operating costs for the Dairy Group in 2000 were plant closing costs of $2.1 million and litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $8.7 million. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.9% in 2000 compared to 18.2% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher marketing expenses in 2000 related to new products. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $0.5 million. Operating Income Operating income in 2000 was $368.1 million, an increase of 32.9% from 1999 operating income of $276.9 million. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, our operating income in 2000 increased $141.2 million or 62.3%. Our operating income margin increased to 6.4% in 2000 compared to 6.2% in 1999 (5.7% excluding the contribution of our packaging operations in 1999). Operating margin at the Dairy Group improved to 6.2% in 2000 from 5.3% in 1999. This increase in operating income margin was due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months. Morningstar Foods operating margin improved to 14.3% in 2000 from 12.8% in 1999 due to increased sales of higher margin products. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased in 2000 by $50.3 million. Interest expense increased to $112.6 million in 2000 from $49.2 million in 1999. This increase was due to additional debt used to finance acquisitions, and also as a result of higher interest rates. Financing charges on preferred securities decreased to $33.6 million in 2000 from $38.6 million in 1999 as a result of the redemption of $100.0 million of 5.0% preferred securities held by Dairy Farmers of America in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods Group, L.P. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is primarily related to our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company, amounted to $11.5 million in 2000. These earnings included $0.8 million, representing our proportional share of a favorable adjustment to previously recorded restructuring charges at Consolidated Container Company. During 1999 we reported $2.6 million in income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily Consolidated Container Company. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.6% in 2000 compared to 39.1% during 1999. This decrease was a result of the sale of our U.S. packaging operations, which had a higher effective tax rate than our dairy operations, and certain tax saving initiatives implemented during 2000. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings increased to $29.9 million in 2000 from $8.8 million in 1999. Effective January 1, 2000 we entered into a joint venture with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA") into which we contributed our domestic fluid dairy operations and DFA contributed the operations of Southern Foods Group and their interests in certain other joint ventures with us. DFA received a 33.8% ownership interest in the joint venture, which is shown as a minority interest on our consolidated financial statements. During 1999, minority interest in earnings consisted primarily of DFA ownership interests in two smaller joint ventures: Suiza GTL, LLC and Land O Sun, LLC. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. 24 Extraordinary Gain During the first quarter of 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Critical accounting policies" are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on our historical experience. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by our external insurance brokers and actuaries. The loss development factors are subject to change based upon actual history and expected trends in costs, among other factors. Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Historically, we assessed the impairment of identifiable intangible, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset may not have been recoverable. To determine whether impairment existed, we compared the expected future net operating cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the carrying amount of the underlying assets. We would have considered a potential impairment if the recorded value of these assets exceeded the associated future net operating cash flows. Any potential impairment loss would have been measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value of assets would have been measured by market value, if an active market existed, or by a forecast of expected future net operating cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" became effective and as a result, goodwill will no longer be amortized. We recorded approximately $45.5 million of goodwill amortization in 2001. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform a transitional impairment assessment of our goodwill in 2002 and annual impairment tests thereafter. As of December 31, 2001, we had $2.95 billion of unamortized goodwill included on our balance sheet. Under SFAS 142, any identifiable intangibles with an indefinite life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. 25 Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair value of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. For significant acquisitions, we utilize valuation specialists and appraisers to assist in the determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including identifiable intangibles. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Emerging Issues Task Force (the "Task Force") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board has reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," which becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2002. This issue addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that have the effect of reducing the price of a product or service to a customer at the point of sale. Our current accounting policy for recording sales incentives within the scope of this issue is to record estimated coupon expense based on historical coupon redemption experience which is consistent with the requirements of this issue. Therefore, our adoption of this issue will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2001, the Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products." We will adopt this Issue in the first quarter of 2002, as required. Under this Issue, certain consideration paid to our customers (such as slotting fees) will be required to be classified as a reduction of revenue, rather than recorded as an expense. Adoption of this Issue will result in the reclassification of certain costs; however, there will be no change in reported net income. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations. Under the new standard, all business combinations entered into after June 30, 2001 are to be accounted for by the purchase method. We have applied the provisions of SFAS No. 141 to all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of Old Dean. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead requires a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and annual impairment tests thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss resulting from the adoption will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in our income statement. We are currently in the process of completing the transitional impairment assessment and any impact on our financial statements. We must complete the first step of this test to determine if we have an impairment by June 30, 2002 and, if we have an impairment, we must complete the final step and record any impairment by December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also requires that recognized intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. As part of the adoption, we are currently reassessing the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets. Any recognized intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the 26 period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. SFAS No. 143 will become effective for us in fiscal year 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" in August 2001 and it became effective for us beginning January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, provides a single, comprehensive accounting model for impairment and disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW During 2001, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations along with borrowings under our former credit facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $310.2 million for 2001 as contrasted to $297.7 million for 2000, an increase of $12.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: A decrease of $3.3 million in net income plus non cash items in 2001 as compared to 2000; and Changes in working capital components which improved by $15.8 million in 2001 compared to the previous year. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.28 billion in 2001 compared to $380.3 million in 2000, an increase of $900.2 million. Cash paid for acquisitions increased to $1.15 billion in 2001 from $336.0 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Old Dean in 2001. CURRENT DEBT OBLIGATIONS Effective December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new $2.7 billion credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800.0 million and two term loans in the amounts of $900.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Both term loans were fully funded upon closing of the Old Dean acquisition and the proceeds were used to repay debt under our former credit facilities, to repay Old Deans credit facility, to purchase DFAs ownership stake in our Dairy Group, and to pay certain other obligations. The revolving line of credit, which expires on July 15, 2007 and is to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including the financing of future acquisition and stock buybacks, if any, subject to certain limitations contained in the credit facility documents) was undrawn. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio (computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness to EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (computed as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense). In addition, this facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth (as defined by the agreement). The agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a change in control and certain other material adverse changes in our business. The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of our credit agreement, including interest rates, principal payment schedules and mandatory prepayment provisions. At December 31, 2001 we had outstanding borrowings of $1.9 billion under our senior credit facility. In addition, $30.4 million of letters of credit secured by the credit facility were issued but undrawn. As of December 31, 2001 approximately $769.6 million was available for future borrowings under this credit facility, 27 subject to satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the loan agreement. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. An additional portion of the cash consideration paid for the Old Dean acquisition and related transactions was provided by new funding under our existing receivables securitization facility. On December 21, 2001, we sold Old Deans receivables into the facility, thereby increasing the amount of the facility by $150.0 million to $400.0 million. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables securitization facility. In addition, certain of Old Deans indebtedness remains outstanding after the acquisition, including $700.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under certain senior notes, approximately $22.0 million of industrial development revenue bonds, and certain capital lease obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness and lease obligations at December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD INDEBTEDNESS & LEASE OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER Senior credit facility............ $1,900,000 $ 72,500 $ 145,000 $145,000 $167,500 $190,000 $1,180,000 Senior notes(1)....... 700,000 100,000 600,000 Receivables backed loan................ 400,000 400,000 Foreign subsidiary term loan........... 35,172 4,818 6,077 7,250 6,982 6,699 3,346 Other lines of credit.............. 2,317 2,317 Industrial development revenue bonds....... 28,001 455 555 555 555 555 25,326 Capital lease obligations and other............... 44,796 16,882 3,549 19,151 4,491 281 442 Operating leases...... 357,870 66,946 63,248 50,047 42,823 31,379 103,427 Totals...... $3,468,156 $163,918 $ 218,429 $622,003 $322,351 $228,914 $1,912,541 (1) Represents face value of senior notes. In addition to the letters of credit secured by our credit facility, we had at December 31, 2001 approximately $71.1 million of letters of credit with three other banks that were issued but undrawn. These were required by various utilities and government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. We do have certain other commitments and contingent obligations. Please see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these commitments and contingent obligations. We do not have any ownership interests or relationships with any special purpose entities (or "bankruptcy remote" entities), other than our ownership of the special purpose entities formed to facilitate our receivables securitization program and our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The assets and liabilities of those entities are fully reflected on our balance sheet. We have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guaranties, nor any debt or equity triggers based on our stock price or credit rating. PREFERRED SECURITIES On March 24, 1998, we issued $600.0 million of company obligated 5.5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 5.5% preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled 28 to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.5% of their liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, at a conversion price of $78.25 (equivalent to a conversion rate of .6390 shares per security). These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time after April 2, 2001 at specified amounts and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events. FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS During 2002, we intend to invest a total of approximately $250.0 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. Of this amount, we intend to spend it as follows: OPERATING DIVISION AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Dairy Group.......................................... $178.0 Morningstar Foods.................................... 50.0 Specialty Foods...................................... 12.0 Other................................................ 10.0 $250.0 We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions that are compatible with our core business strategy. Any such acquisitions, as well as any stock repurchases, will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit facility. If necessary, we believe that we have the ability to secure additional financing for our future capital requirements. KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We have recently announced that we intend to continue to make acquisitions in our core businesses and, over the next several years, to divest non core businesses. RAW MATERIAL PRICES The primary raw materials used in our operations are raw milk and butterfat. The prices we pay for these materials are regulated by the federal government, and in some cases by state and other regulatory agencies. Prices of raw milk and butterfat can be very volatile. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase and the effectiveness of a corresponding price increase to our customers, and in some cases we are contractually restrained with respect to the means and timing of implementing price increases. Also, at some point price increases do erode our volumes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our operating profit margin tends to fluctuate with the price of our raw materials. CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE Many of our customers in the airline, food service and hospitality industries have suffered decreases in sales volumes since the events of September 11 and the resulting economic climate. While we have seen some improvements in these areas, our sales to some of these customers continue to be weaker than prior to 29 September 11 and may take several months to recover. Some of our customers in the retail grocery industry have also suffered decreased sales volumes as a result of the current economic climate, and we have seen some of those customers file for bankruptcy protection in recent months. While we do not expect this trend to have a material adverse effect on our business, we do expect this trend to continue until our economy returns to more stable levels. INTEREST RATES We have hedged a portion of our variable interest rate exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements that have the effect of "converting" the hedged debt from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. Approximately 40% of our variable rate debt is currently hedged. The percentage of our total debt that is hedged will fluctuate as our debt level fluctuates. Moveover, we constantly monitor the prevailing interest rate environment, and may increase the percentage of our debt that is hedged if interest rates threaten to increase to substantially higher levels, or become more volatile. RATIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES As part of our overall integration and cost reduction strategy, we recorded plant closing and other non recurring costs during 2001, 2000 and 1999 in the amounts of $9.6 million, $3.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These charges included the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of plant closings, plant rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions. The plans included an overall reduction of 198 people in 2001, 205 people in 2000 and 315 people in 1999, who were primarily plant employees associated with the plant closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to our earnings in the period that the plan was established in detail and employee severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare the plant facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities no longer used in operations. The impairments related primarily to owned building, land and equipment at the facilities that were sold and written down to their estimated fair value. As part of our purchase price allocations, we accrued costs of $28.0 million in 2001 and $11.0 million in 2000 pursuant to plans to exit certain activities and operations of acquired businesses in order to rationalize production and reduce costs and inefficiencies. Several plants were closed in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods in 2000. We have implemented certain plans to shut down plants and administrative offices in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, which was completed on December 21, 2001. We will continue to finalize and implement our initial integration and rationalization plans related to the Old Dean acquisition and we expect to refine our estimate of costs associated with these plans. The principal components of the plans will include the following: Workforce reductions, to be charged against acquisition liabilities for these costs; Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to prepare facilities for closure; and Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes after shutdown. We do not expect any of these costs to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For more information on our restructuring and exit plans see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 TAX RATE Our 2001 tax rate was approximately 36.3%. However, we believe that our effective tax rate will increase to a range of approximately 37.0% to 38.0% over the next several years, as Old Deans tax rate was higher than our tax rate prior to the Old Dean acquisition. In addition, the 2001 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of a contested state tax issue. UTILITY COSTS In 1999, we entered into a contract with Enron Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten year period. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on December 1, 2001, and subsequently elected to reject our contract in its bankruptcy. We do not expect to be able to replace the economic benefits of our contract with Enron. Therefore, we expect our utility costs to return to market levels in the future. See " Risk Factors" for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. RISK FACTORS This report contains statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact. Most of these statements are found in Items 1, 7 and 7a of this report under the following subheadings: "Current Business Strategy," "Government Regulation," "Industry Overview," "Raw Materials and Supply," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Known Trends and Uncertainties" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES MANAGING OUR GROWTH We have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years, particularly with the acquisition of Chicago based Dean Foods Company ("Old Dean") in December 2001. This rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and our financial and operational resources, which subjects us to various risks, including among others: inability to successfully integrate or operate acquired businesses, inability to retain key customers of acquired or existing businesses, and inability to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from our increased size. The integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future may also require us to invest more capital than we expected or require more time and effort by management than we expected. If we fail to effectively manage the integration of the businesses we have acquired, particularly Old Dean, our operations and financial results will be affected, both materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our business is subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. See "Part I Item 1. Business Competition." If we fail to successfully compete against our competitors, our business will be adversely affected. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition among us and our competitors to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is particularly important to our future growth, as demand tends to be relatively flat in our industry. Moreover, as our 31 customers become larger, they will have greater purchasing leverage, and could force prices and margins, particularly for our Dairy Group, lower than current levels. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR INNOVATION EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in product innovation in an effort to increase our sales and profit margins as well as the overall consumption of dairy products. We believe that sales and profit growth through innovation is a significant source of growth for our business. The success of our innovation initiatives will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our products, of which there can be no assurance. If our innovation efforts do not succeed, or if we do not have adequate resources to invest in innovation, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk, butterfat and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand and, in some cases, governmental regulation. For more information about the pricing of raw milk, see "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply" and "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation." Prices of raw milk, butterfat and certain other raw materials used in our Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods segments can fluctuate widely over short periods of time. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance, however, as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. We were adversely affected in 2001 by raw material costs. Although raw material costs have returned to normal levels in 2002 to date, we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs. Because we deliver a majority of our products directly to our customers through our "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of gasoline. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. Also, since we lost our energy supply agreement with Enron (see "Item 1. Business Developments since January 1, 2001 Enron"), we will pay market prices for electricity in the foreseeable future. As we are a significant consumer of electricity, any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources." We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results. If we do not comply with the 32 financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies. LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF OUR LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Hersheys(R), Borden(R), Pet(R), Folgers(R) Jakada(TM), Land O Lakes(R) and others. In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR SHORTAGES OF MILK SUPPLY RELATED TO MAD COW DISEASE AND/OR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US Recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE" or "mad cow disease") in some European countries have raised public concern about the safety of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal derived products. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted to milk. However, we are still subject to risk as a result of public misperception that milk products may be affected by mad cow disease. To date, we have not seen any measurable impact on our milk sales in Spain or the United States resulting from concerns about mad cow disease. However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease, we could suffer a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect our financial results. Foot and Mouth Disease ("FMD") is a highly contagious disease of cattle, swine, sheep, goats, deer and other cloven hooved animals. FMD causes severe losses in the production of meat and milk; however, FMD does not pose a health risk to humans. While there have been several recent occurrences of FMD in Europe, the United States has been free of FMD since 1929. To date, we have not seen a measurable impact on our supply of raw milk in Spain as a result of FMD. However, should FMD become widespread in Spain, a milk supply shortage could develop, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk for our Spanish operations and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in Spain. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our Spanish customers needs, and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in Spain, our financial results in Spain could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if there is an outbreak of FMD in the United States, a shortage of raw milk could develop in the United States, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in the United States. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our U.S. customers needs and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in the United States, our consolidated financial results could be materially and adversely affected. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO DAIRY FARMERS OF AMERICA, IF WE FAIL TO OFFER THEM THE RIGHT TO SUPPLY RAW MILK TO CERTAIN OF OLD DEANS PLANTS In connection with our purchase of the minority interest in our Dairy Group, we entered into an agreement with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA"), the nations largest dairy farmers cooperative and our primary supplier of raw milk, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay to DFA liquidated damages in an amount of up to $47.0 million if we fail to offer them the right, within a specified period of time after completion of the Old Dean acquisition, to supply raw milk to certain of Old Deans plants. The amount of damages to be paid, if any, would be determined on a plant by plant basis for each Old Dean plants milk supply that is not offered to DFA, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by the plant. We would be required to pay the liquidated damages even if we were prohibited from offering the business to DFA by an injunction, restraining order or contractual obligation. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this agreement. Old Dean currently has milk supply agreements with several raw milk suppliers other than DFA. If any such supplier believes that it has rights to continue to supply Old Deans plants beyond the deadline dates contained in our agreement with DFA, and is successful in legally 33 establishing any such rights, we may be prohibited from offering DFA the right to supply certain of the Old Dean plants and, therefore, be required to pay all or a portion of the liquidated damages to DFA. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR GUARANTY OF CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER COMPANYS DEBT In February 2002, we executed a limited guarantee of certain indebtedness of Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), in which we own a 43.1% interest. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the terms of the guaranty. CCC has experienced various operational difficulties over the past 6 to 9 months, which has adversely affected its financial performance. CCCs ability to repay the guaranteed indebtedness will depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business plan, of which there can be no assurance. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as: product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverages. Although we maintain quality control programs designed to address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could result in: product withdrawals, product recalls, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. POOR WEATHER CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SPECIALTY FOODS SEGMENT Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. See "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply." Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our success depends to a large extent on the skills, experience and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of these persons could hurt our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, directors or other employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business will be adversely affected. 34 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or change of control. Our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors, divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year, permit directors to be removed only for cause, and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of our voting stock. We also have a stockholder rights plan. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events, our stockholders will be able to buy stock from us or our successor at reduced prices. These rights do not extend, however, to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors. Accordingly, this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We, like others in similar businesses, are subject to a variety of federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those regulating waste water and storm water, air emissions, storage tanks and hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Future developments, including increasingly stringent regulations, could require us to make currently unforeseen environmental expenditures. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swaps have been designated as hedges against variable interest rate exposure on loans under our senior credit facility. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements: NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE 2001 (IN MILLIONS) 4.90% to 4.93%....................................... December 2002 $275.0 6.07% to 6.24%....................................... December 2002 325.0 6.23%................................................ June 2003 50.0 6.69%................................................ December 2004 100.0 6.69% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 100.0 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75.0 These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the credit facility at the interest rates noted above until the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate derivative agreements. 35 These derivative agreements were previously designated as hedges for borrowings under our terminated Suiza Dairy Group credit facility, but were redesignated upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges for loans under Leche Celtas term loan. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes these agreements: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS 5.54% November 2003 1,500,000,000 pesetas (approximately $8.0 million as of December 31, 2001) 5.6% November 2004 2,000,000,000 pesetas (approximately $10.7 million as of December 31, 2001) We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $6.9 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes and minority interest, during 2001 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. FOREIGN CURRENCY We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound and the euro. At this time, we believe that potential losses due to foreign currency fluctuations would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 36 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are the leading processor and distributor of fresh milk and other dairy products in the United States and a leader in the specialty foods industry. We have five operating divisions including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, Specialty Foods, Puerto Rico and International. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business" for a general description of our business. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, three of our operating divisions are separately reportable business segments: Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2001 Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2001" for a description of recent developments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain information concerning our results of operations, including information presented as a percentage of net sales. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 2000 1999 DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Net sales....................... $6,230,116 100.0% $5,756,303 100.0% $4,481,999 100.0% Cost of sales................... 4,750,100 76.2 4,330,067 75.2 3,487,075 77.8 Gross profit.................... 1,480,016 23.8 1,426,236 24.8 994,924 22.2 Operating costs and expenses: Selling and distribution...... 855,192 13.7 812,274 14.1 518,962 11.5 General and administrative.... 184,790 3.0 182,570 3.2 148,009 3.3 Amortization of intangibles... 53,349 0.9 52,441 0.9 38,513 0.9 Plant closing costs........... 9,550 0.2 3,388 0.1 12,566 0.3 Other operating (income) expense....................

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Note: We completed our acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Because Old Deans results of operations for the last few days of 2001 are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements, full year comparisons may be less meaningful than they would be otherwise. Also, comparison data is not provided for our Specialty Foods segment since we owned it for only the last 10 days of the year. Segment data for Specialty Foods for the period since the acquisition are included in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. More complete segment data for Specialty Foods can be found in the transition report on Form 10 KT of Dean Holding Company for the seven month period ended December 31, 2001. Net Sales Net sales increased 8.2% to $6.23 billion during 2001 from $5.76 billion in 2000. Approximately $103.1 million of this increase was due to the acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 8.4%, or $391.3 million, in 2001, and net sales for Morningstar Foods increased 8.9%, or $62.7 million in 2001. $74.7 million and $9.7 million of these increases, respectively, are due to the sales of Old Dean being included in our results since December 21, 2001 (the date of acquisition). 21 The remaining portions of these increases were primarily due to an increase in prices charged for our products in response to higher raw milk and butterfat costs, and occurred despite a small decline in volume. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 76.2% in 2001 compared to 75.2% in 2000. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group increased to 77.1% in 2001 from 75.9% in 2000 and the cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods increased to 67.6% in 2001 from 66.8% in 2000. These increases were due to higher raw milk and butterfat costs in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 17.5% in 2001 compared to 18.4% in 2000. Included in 2001 operating costs were the following non recurring items: A gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of the 11 plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean (which gain represented the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants), An expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of America as consideration for modifications to our milk supply arrangements, Expenses of $9.6 million for plant closings, and An expense of $1.7 million resulting from the impairment in value of a water plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2000 the following non recurring expenses were included in operating costs: Litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million, and Expenses of $3.4 million for plant closings. Excluding these nonrecurring items, our operating expense ratio in 2001 was 17.6% compared to 18.2% in 2000. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group, excluding non recurring items, was 17.8% in 2001 compared to 18.3% in 2000. This decrease was primarily due to various cost savings initiatives (most of which were temporary) implemented during 2001 in response to a difficult operating environment. These initiatives resulted in lower selling and general and administrative costs during 2001. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.8% in both 2001 and 2000. Although similar cost savings initiatives were implemented at Morningstar Foods in 2001 as were implemented at the Dairy Group, their overall operating expense ratio remained steady due to higher distribution and selling expenses related to the introduction of new products. Operating Income Operating income in 2001 was $394.4 million, an increase of $26.3 million from 2000 operating income of $368.1 million. Our operating margin in 2001 was 6.3% compared to 6.4% in 2000. Excluding the nonrecurring items listed above, our operating income increased $7.7 million in 2001 to $386.7 million and our operating margin decreased to 6.2% in 2001 from 6.6% in 2000. The Dairy Groups operating margin, excluding the non recurring items, decreased to 5.1% in 2001 from 5.8% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher raw milk costs during 2001, partly offset by lower operating costs. Morningstar Foods operating margin declined to 13.6% in 2001 from 14.3% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher butterfat costs in 2001. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $29.6 million in 2001. Interest expense decreased to $101.8 million in 2001 from $112.6 million in 2000. This decrease was the result of lower debt balances and lower interest rates in 2001. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which relates primarily to our 43.1% minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), was a loss of $23.6 million in 2001 compared to income of $11.5 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 loss is an impairment charge of $21.1 million related to the write off of our investment in CCC. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. CCC has implemented several changes in an effort to return 22 to stable profitability. However, in November 2001 CCC announced that it did not expect to see the benefits of these changes for at least several quarters. Also, as a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. Other income and expense also includes $4.4 million of impairment charges related to two other small investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.3% in 2001 compared to 38.6% in 2000. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of a contested state tax issue during 2001. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings, which was primarily the 33.8% ownership interest of Dairy Farmers of America in our Dairy Group, increased to $31.4 million in 2001 compared to $29.9 million in 2000. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. In 2001, we also purchased the 25% minority interest of Leche Celta. We now own 100% of our Spanish operations. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with the acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result, we recognized a $4.3 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of $3.0 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early retirement of our former credit facilities. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended). Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $1.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and minority interest benefit of $0.7 million, as a charge to earnings. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 Net Sales Net sales increased 28.4% to $5.76 billion during 2000 from $4.48 billion in 1999. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, sales increased $1.72 billion or 43.1% in 2000. Net sales for our Dairy Group increased by $1.56 billion, or 50.2%, in 2000 compared to 1999 mainly due to acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of Southern Foods Group. Net sales for Morningstar Foods increased by $49.1 million, or 7.5%, in 2000 due to increased sales of higher priced products. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 75.2% in 2000 compared to 77.8% in 1999. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group decreased to 75.9% in 2000 from 79.6% in 1999. This ratio improved due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months, lower raw material costs and because Southern Foods Group, which we acquired effective January 1, 2000, has a lower cost of sales ratio than some of our other dairies because of its extensive use of direct store delivery. The customer base of Southern Foods Group is somewhat different from our other dairies, which requires Southern Foods to charge higher prices to cover higher distribution costs. The cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods improved to 66.8% from 69.0%, due to an increased emphasis on cost savings initiatives, as well as increased sales of higher priced products. 23 Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 18.4% in 2000 compared to 16.0% in 1999. The operating expense ratio at our Dairy Group was 17.9% in 2000 compared to 15.1% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher distribution costs at Southern Foods Group as a result of its extensive direct store delivery routes in rural areas, and increased distribution costs in 2000 because of higher fuel costs. These cost increases were partly offset by a $3.6 million pre tax gain in the second quarter of 2000 related to the curtailment of certain defined benefit plans. Included in operating costs for the Dairy Group in 2000 were plant closing costs of $2.1 million and litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $8.7 million. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 18.9% in 2000 compared to 18.2% in 1999. This ratio increased due to higher marketing expenses in 2000 related to new products. In 1999, plant closing costs amounted to $0.5 million. Operating Income Operating income in 2000 was $368.1 million, an increase of 32.9% from 1999 operating income of $276.9 million. Excluding the effect of our packaging operations, our operating income in 2000 increased $141.2 million or 62.3%. Our operating income margin increased to 6.4% in 2000 compared to 6.2% in 1999 (5.7% excluding the contribution of our packaging operations in 1999). Operating margin at the Dairy Group improved to 6.2% in 2000 from 5.3% in 1999. This increase in operating income margin was due to improved performance at dairies owned more than twelve months. Morningstar Foods operating margin improved to 14.3% in 2000 from 12.8% in 1999 due to increased sales of higher margin products. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased in 2000 by $50.3 million. Interest expense increased to $112.6 million in 2000 from $49.2 million in 1999. This increase was due to additional debt used to finance acquisitions, and also as a result of higher interest rates. Financing charges on preferred securities decreased to $33.6 million in 2000 from $38.6 million in 1999 as a result of the redemption of $100.0 million of 5.0% preferred securities held by Dairy Farmers of America in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods Group, L.P. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which is primarily related to our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company, amounted to $11.5 million in 2000. These earnings included $0.8 million, representing our proportional share of a favorable adjustment to previously recorded restructuring charges at Consolidated Container Company. During 1999 we reported $2.6 million in income from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily Consolidated Container Company. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.6% in 2000 compared to 39.1% during 1999. This decrease was a result of the sale of our U.S. packaging operations, which had a higher effective tax rate than our dairy operations, and certain tax saving initiatives implemented during 2000. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings increased to $29.9 million in 2000 from $8.8 million in 1999. Effective January 1, 2000 we entered into a joint venture with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA") into which we contributed our domestic fluid dairy operations and DFA contributed the operations of Southern Foods Group and their interests in certain other joint ventures with us. DFA received a 33.8% ownership interest in the joint venture, which is shown as a minority interest on our consolidated financial statements. During 1999, minority interest in earnings consisted primarily of DFA ownership interests in two smaller joint ventures: Suiza GTL, LLC and Land O Sun, LLC. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. 24 Extraordinary Gain During the first quarter of 2000 we recognized a $5.0 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Critical accounting policies" are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on our historical experience. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by our external insurance brokers and actuaries. The loss development factors are subject to change based upon actual history and expected trends in costs, among other factors. Valuation of Long Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill Historically, we assessed the impairment of identifiable intangible, long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the asset may not have been recoverable. To determine whether impairment existed, we compared the expected future net operating cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the carrying amount of the underlying assets. We would have considered a potential impairment if the recorded value of these assets exceeded the associated future net operating cash flows. Any potential impairment loss would have been measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the asset. Fair value of assets would have been measured by market value, if an active market existed, or by a forecast of expected future net operating cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" became effective and as a result, goodwill will no longer be amortized. We recorded approximately $45.5 million of goodwill amortization in 2001. In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform a transitional impairment assessment of our goodwill in 2002 and annual impairment tests thereafter. As of December 31, 2001, we had $2.95 billion of unamortized goodwill included on our balance sheet. Under SFAS 142, any identifiable intangibles with an indefinite life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. 25 Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair value of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. For significant acquisitions, we utilize valuation specialists and appraisers to assist in the determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including identifiable intangibles. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Emerging Issues Task Force (the "Task Force") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board has reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," which becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2002. This issue addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification of sales incentives that have the effect of reducing the price of a product or service to a customer at the point of sale. Our current accounting policy for recording sales incentives within the scope of this issue is to record estimated coupon expense based on historical coupon redemption experience which is consistent with the requirements of this issue. Therefore, our adoption of this issue will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements. In April 2001, the Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products." We will adopt this Issue in the first quarter of 2002, as required. Under this Issue, certain consideration paid to our customers (such as slotting fees) will be required to be classified as a reduction of revenue, rather than recorded as an expense. Adoption of this Issue will result in the reclassification of certain costs; however, there will be no change in reported net income. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." SFAS No. 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for business combinations. Under the new standard, all business combinations entered into after June 30, 2001 are to be accounted for by the purchase method. We have applied the provisions of SFAS No. 141 to all business combinations completed after June 30, 2001, including the acquisition of Old Dean. SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill no longer be amortized, but instead requires a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and annual impairment tests thereafter. Any transitional impairment loss resulting from the adoption will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting principle in our income statement. We are currently in the process of completing the transitional impairment assessment and any impact on our financial statements. We must complete the first step of this test to determine if we have an impairment by June 30, 2002 and, if we have an impairment, we must complete the final step and record any impairment by December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 142 also requires that recognized intangible assets be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. As part of the adoption, we are currently reassessing the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets. Any recognized intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life will not be amortized, but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the standard. In June 2001, FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the 26 period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. SFAS No. 143 will become effective for us in fiscal year 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements. FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" in August 2001 and it became effective for us beginning January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 144, which supercedes SFAS No. 121, provides a single, comprehensive accounting model for impairment and disposal of long lived assets and discontinued operations. Our adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW During 2001, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations along with borrowings under our former credit facilities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $310.2 million for 2001 as contrasted to $297.7 million for 2000, an increase of $12.5 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: A decrease of $3.3 million in net income plus non cash items in 2001 as compared to 2000; and Changes in working capital components which improved by $15.8 million in 2001 compared to the previous year. Net cash used in investing activities was $1.28 billion in 2001 compared to $380.3 million in 2000, an increase of $900.2 million. Cash paid for acquisitions increased to $1.15 billion in 2001 from $336.0 million in 2000 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Old Dean in 2001. CURRENT DEBT OBLIGATIONS Effective December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new $2.7 billion credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800.0 million and two term loans in the amounts of $900.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Both term loans were fully funded upon closing of the Old Dean acquisition and the proceeds were used to repay debt under our former credit facilities, to repay Old Deans credit facility, to purchase DFAs ownership stake in our Dairy Group, and to pay certain other obligations. The revolving line of credit, which expires on July 15, 2007 and is to be used for general corporate and working capital purposes (including the financing of future acquisition and stock buybacks, if any, subject to certain limitations contained in the credit facility documents) was undrawn. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio (computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness to EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (computed as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense). In addition, this facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth (as defined by the agreement). The agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a change in control and certain other material adverse changes in our business. The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of our credit agreement, including interest rates, principal payment schedules and mandatory prepayment provisions. At December 31, 2001 we had outstanding borrowings of $1.9 billion under our senior credit facility. In addition, $30.4 million of letters of credit secured by the credit facility were issued but undrawn. As of December 31, 2001 approximately $769.6 million was available for future borrowings under this credit facility, 27 subject to satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the loan agreement. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. An additional portion of the cash consideration paid for the Old Dean acquisition and related transactions was provided by new funding under our existing receivables securitization facility. On December 21, 2001, we sold Old Deans receivables into the facility, thereby increasing the amount of the facility by $150.0 million to $400.0 million. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables securitization facility. In addition, certain of Old Deans indebtedness remains outstanding after the acquisition, including $700.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under certain senior notes, approximately $22.0 million of industrial development revenue bonds, and certain capital lease obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness and lease obligations at December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD INDEBTEDNESS & LEASE OBLIGATIONS TOTAL 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER Senior credit facility............ $1,900,000 $ 72,500 $ 145,000 $145,000 $167,500 $190,000 $1,180,000 Senior notes(1)....... 700,000 100,000 600,000 Receivables backed loan................ 400,000 400,000 Foreign subsidiary term loan........... 35,172 4,818 6,077 7,250 6,982 6,699 3,346 Other lines of credit.............. 2,317 2,317 Industrial development revenue bonds....... 28,001 455 555 555 555 555 25,326 Capital lease obligations and other............... 44,796 16,882 3,549 19,151 4,491 281 442 Operating leases...... 357,870 66,946 63,248 50,047 42,823 31,379 103,427 Totals...... $3,468,156 $163,918 $ 218,429 $622,003 $322,351 $228,914 $1,912,541 (1) Represents face value of senior notes. In addition to the letters of credit secured by our credit facility, we had at December 31, 2001 approximately $71.1 million of letters of credit with three other banks that were issued but undrawn. These were required by various utilities and government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. We do have certain other commitments and contingent obligations. Please see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of these commitments and contingent obligations. We do not have any ownership interests or relationships with any special purpose entities (or "bankruptcy remote" entities), other than our ownership of the special purpose entities formed to facilitate our receivables securitization program and our mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. The assets and liabilities of those entities are fully reflected on our balance sheet. We have no other significant off balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or guaranties, nor any debt or equity triggers based on our stock price or credit rating. PREFERRED SECURITIES On March 24, 1998, we issued $600.0 million of company obligated 5.5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 5.5% preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled 28 to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.5% of their liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, at a conversion price of $78.25 (equivalent to a conversion rate of .6390 shares per security). These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time after April 2, 2001 at specified amounts and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events. FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS During 2002, we intend to invest a total of approximately $250.0 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. Of this amount, we intend to spend it as follows: OPERATING DIVISION AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Dairy Group.......................................... $178.0 Morningstar Foods.................................... 50.0 Specialty Foods...................................... 12.0 Other................................................ 10.0 $250.0 We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions that are compatible with our core business strategy. Any such acquisitions, as well as any stock repurchases, will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our credit facility. If necessary, we believe that we have the ability to secure additional financing for our future capital requirements. KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES We have recently announced that we intend to continue to make acquisitions in our core businesses and, over the next several years, to divest non core businesses. RAW MATERIAL PRICES The primary raw materials used in our operations are raw milk and butterfat. The prices we pay for these materials are regulated by the federal government, and in some cases by state and other regulatory agencies. Prices of raw milk and butterfat can be very volatile. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase and the effectiveness of a corresponding price increase to our customers, and in some cases we are contractually restrained with respect to the means and timing of implementing price increases. Also, at some point price increases do erode our volumes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our operating profit margin tends to fluctuate with the price of our raw materials. CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE Many of our customers in the airline, food service and hospitality industries have suffered decreases in sales volumes since the events of September 11 and the resulting economic climate. While we have seen some improvements in these areas, our sales to some of these customers continue to be weaker than prior to 29 September 11 and may take several months to recover. Some of our customers in the retail grocery industry have also suffered decreased sales volumes as a result of the current economic climate, and we have seen some of those customers file for bankruptcy protection in recent months. While we do not expect this trend to have a material adverse effect on our business, we do expect this trend to continue until our economy returns to more stable levels. INTEREST RATES We have hedged a portion of our variable interest rate exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements that have the effect of "converting" the hedged debt from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. Approximately 40% of our variable rate debt is currently hedged. The percentage of our total debt that is hedged will fluctuate as our debt level fluctuates. Moveover, we constantly monitor the prevailing interest rate environment, and may increase the percentage of our debt that is hedged if interest rates threaten to increase to substantially higher levels, or become more volatile. RATIONALIZATION ACTIVITIES As part of our overall integration and cost reduction strategy, we recorded plant closing and other non recurring costs during 2001, 2000 and 1999 in the amounts of $9.6 million, $3.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. These charges included the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of plant closings, plant rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions. The plans included an overall reduction of 198 people in 2001, 205 people in 2000 and 315 people in 1999, who were primarily plant employees associated with the plant closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to our earnings in the period that the plan was established in detail and employee severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare the plant facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities no longer used in operations. The impairments related primarily to owned building, land and equipment at the facilities that were sold and written down to their estimated fair value. As part of our purchase price allocations, we accrued costs of $28.0 million in 2001 and $11.0 million in 2000 pursuant to plans to exit certain activities and operations of acquired businesses in order to rationalize production and reduce costs and inefficiencies. Several plants were closed in connection with our acquisition of Southern Foods in 2000. We have implemented certain plans to shut down plants and administrative offices in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, which was completed on December 21, 2001. We will continue to finalize and implement our initial integration and rationalization plans related to the Old Dean acquisition and we expect to refine our estimate of costs associated with these plans. The principal components of the plans will include the following: Workforce reductions, to be charged against acquisition liabilities for these costs; Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to prepare facilities for closure; and Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes after shutdown. We do not expect any of these costs to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. For more information on our restructuring and exit plans see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 TAX RATE Our 2001 tax rate was approximately 36.3%. However, we believe that our effective tax rate will increase to a range of approximately 37.0% to 38.0% over the next several years, as Old Deans tax rate was higher than our tax rate prior to the Old Dean acquisition. In addition, the 2001 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of a contested state tax issue. UTILITY COSTS In 1999, we entered into a contract with Enron Energy Services pursuant to which we contracted to purchase electricity for certain of our plants at a discounted rate for a ten year period. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on December 1, 2001, and subsequently elected to reject our contract in its bankruptcy. We do not expect to be able to replace the economic benefits of our contract with Enron. Therefore, we expect our utility costs to return to market levels in the future. See " Risk Factors" for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. RISK FACTORS This report contains statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact. Most of these statements are found in Items 1, 7 and 7a of this report under the following subheadings: "Current Business Strategy," "Government Regulation," "Industry Overview," "Raw Materials and Supply," "Liquidity and Capital Resources," "Known Trends and Uncertainties" and "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES MANAGING OUR GROWTH We have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years, particularly with the acquisition of Chicago based Dean Foods Company ("Old Dean") in December 2001. This rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and our financial and operational resources, which subjects us to various risks, including among others: inability to successfully integrate or operate acquired businesses, inability to retain key customers of acquired or existing businesses, and inability to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from our increased size. The integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire in the future may also require us to invest more capital than we expected or require more time and effort by management than we expected. If we fail to effectively manage the integration of the businesses we have acquired, particularly Old Dean, our operations and financial results will be affected, both materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our business is subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. See "Part I Item 1. Business Competition." If we fail to successfully compete against our competitors, our business will be adversely affected. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition among us and our competitors to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is particularly important to our future growth, as demand tends to be relatively flat in our industry. Moreover, as our 31 customers become larger, they will have greater purchasing leverage, and could force prices and margins, particularly for our Dairy Group, lower than current levels. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR INNOVATION EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in product innovation in an effort to increase our sales and profit margins as well as the overall consumption of dairy products. We believe that sales and profit growth through innovation is a significant source of growth for our business. The success of our innovation initiatives will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our products, of which there can be no assurance. If our innovation efforts do not succeed, or if we do not have adequate resources to invest in innovation, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk, butterfat and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand and, in some cases, governmental regulation. For more information about the pricing of raw milk, see "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply" and "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation." Prices of raw milk, butterfat and certain other raw materials used in our Morningstar Foods and Specialty Foods segments can fluctuate widely over short periods of time. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance, however, as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. We were adversely affected in 2001 by raw material costs. Although raw material costs have returned to normal levels in 2002 to date, we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs. Because we deliver a majority of our products directly to our customers through our "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of gasoline. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. Also, since we lost our energy supply agreement with Enron (see "Item 1. Business Developments since January 1, 2001 Enron"), we will pay market prices for electricity in the foreseeable future. As we are a significant consumer of electricity, any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources." We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results. If we do not comply with the 32 financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies. LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF OUR LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Hersheys(R), Borden(R), Pet(R), Folgers(R) Jakada(TM), Land O Lakes(R) and others. In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. NEGATIVE PUBLICITY AND/OR SHORTAGES OF MILK SUPPLY RELATED TO MAD COW DISEASE AND/OR FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US Recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE" or "mad cow disease") in some European countries have raised public concern about the safety of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal derived products. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted to milk. However, we are still subject to risk as a result of public misperception that milk products may be affected by mad cow disease. To date, we have not seen any measurable impact on our milk sales in Spain or the United States resulting from concerns about mad cow disease. However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease, we could suffer a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect our financial results. Foot and Mouth Disease ("FMD") is a highly contagious disease of cattle, swine, sheep, goats, deer and other cloven hooved animals. FMD causes severe losses in the production of meat and milk; however, FMD does not pose a health risk to humans. While there have been several recent occurrences of FMD in Europe, the United States has been free of FMD since 1929. To date, we have not seen a measurable impact on our supply of raw milk in Spain as a result of FMD. However, should FMD become widespread in Spain, a milk supply shortage could develop, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk for our Spanish operations and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in Spain. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our Spanish customers needs, and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in Spain, our financial results in Spain could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if there is an outbreak of FMD in the United States, a shortage of raw milk could develop in the United States, which would affect our ability to obtain raw milk and the price that we are required to pay for raw milk in the United States. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient amount of raw milk to satisfy our U.S. customers needs and or if we are forced to pay a significantly higher price for raw milk in the United States, our consolidated financial results could be materially and adversely affected. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDATED DAMAGES TO DAIRY FARMERS OF AMERICA, IF WE FAIL TO OFFER THEM THE RIGHT TO SUPPLY RAW MILK TO CERTAIN OF OLD DEANS PLANTS In connection with our purchase of the minority interest in our Dairy Group, we entered into an agreement with Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA"), the nations largest dairy farmers cooperative and our primary supplier of raw milk, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay to DFA liquidated damages in an amount of up to $47.0 million if we fail to offer them the right, within a specified period of time after completion of the Old Dean acquisition, to supply raw milk to certain of Old Deans plants. The amount of damages to be paid, if any, would be determined on a plant by plant basis for each Old Dean plants milk supply that is not offered to DFA, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by the plant. We would be required to pay the liquidated damages even if we were prohibited from offering the business to DFA by an injunction, restraining order or contractual obligation. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this agreement. Old Dean currently has milk supply agreements with several raw milk suppliers other than DFA. If any such supplier believes that it has rights to continue to supply Old Deans plants beyond the deadline dates contained in our agreement with DFA, and is successful in legally 33 establishing any such rights, we may be prohibited from offering DFA the right to supply certain of the Old Dean plants and, therefore, be required to pay all or a portion of the liquidated damages to DFA. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SATISFY OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR GUARANTY OF CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER COMPANYS DEBT In February 2002, we executed a limited guarantee of certain indebtedness of Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), in which we own a 43.1% interest. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning the terms of the guaranty. CCC has experienced various operational difficulties over the past 6 to 9 months, which has adversely affected its financial performance. CCCs ability to repay the guaranteed indebtedness will depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to successfully implement its business plan, of which there can be no assurance. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as: product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverages. Although we maintain quality control programs designed to address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could result in: product withdrawals, product recalls, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. POOR WEATHER CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SPECIALTY FOODS SEGMENT Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. See "Part I Item 1. Business Raw Materials and Supply." Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our success depends to a large extent on the skills, experience and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of these persons could hurt our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, directors or other employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business will be adversely affected. 34 CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or change of control. Our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors, divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year, permit directors to be removed only for cause, and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of our voting stock. We also have a stockholder rights plan. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events, our stockholders will be able to buy stock from us or our successor at reduced prices. These rights do not extend, however, to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors. Accordingly, this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We, like others in similar businesses, are subject to a variety of federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those regulating waste water and storm water, air emissions, storage tanks and hazardous materials. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Future developments, including increasingly stringent regulations, could require us to make currently unforeseen environmental expenditures. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swaps have been designated as hedges against variable interest rate exposure on loans under our senior credit facility. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements: NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE 2001 (IN MILLIONS) 4.90% to 4.93%....................................... December 2002 $275.0 6.07% to 6.24%....................................... December 2002 325.0 6.23%................................................ June 2003 50.0 6.69%................................................ December 2004 100.0 6.69% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 100.0 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75.0 These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the credit facility at the interest rates noted above until the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate derivative agreements. 35 These derivative agreements were previously designated as hedges for borrowings under our terminated Suiza Dairy Group credit facility, but were redesignated upon completion of the Old Dean acquisition. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges for loans under Leche Celtas term loan. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes these agreements: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS 5.54% November 2003 1,500,000,000 pesetas (approximately $8.0 million as of December 31, 2001) 5.6% November 2004 2,000,000,000 pesetas (approximately $10.7 million as of December 31, 2001) We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $6.9 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes and minority interest, during 2001 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2001, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. FOREIGN CURRENCY We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound and the euro. At this time, we believe that potential losses due to foreign currency fluctuations would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 36
