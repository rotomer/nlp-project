Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk and Cream" on page 34. The price of raw milk can fluctuate widely. Other raw materials used by the Dairy Group, such as juice concentrates, sweeteners and packaging supplies are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of our Dairy Groups raw materials are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of our raw materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand. The dairy industry is a mature industry which has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by large grocery retailers and little to no growth in the demand for fresh milk products. Over the past 10 to 15 years, the dairy industry has experienced significant consolidation. Consolidation has tended to raise efficiency. However, consumption of fluid dairy products has generally remained flat and has even declined in some regions of the country. Therefore, sales growth across the industry generally remains modest and profit margins generally remain low. Historically, the fluid dairy industry has not experienced a significant amount of innovation in products or packaging. However, innovation and branding have become increasingly important in 7 recent years as processors seek to increase consumption, sales and margins through product differentiation and branding. The dairy industry is highly competitive. Our Dairy Group has many competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, quality and taste preference. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Net sales in the Dairy Group to unaffiliated customers totaled $7.06 billion in 2002. For more financial information about our Dairy Groups recent operations, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" beginning on page 22 and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. MORNINGSTAR/WHITE WAVE Morningstar Foods manufactures and sells: dairy and non dairy liquid coffee creamers, extended shelf life ("ESL") milks, including flavored milks, lactose reduced milks and milk based beverages, cultured dairy products, dips and dressings, aerosol whipped topping, dairy and non dairy frozen whipped topping and frozen creamers, and egg substitute. In 2002, net sales of liquid coffee creamers represented approximately 36% of Morningstar Foods net sales to unaffiliated customers, while ESL milks, cultured products and dips/dressings represented approximately 31%, 10% and 9%, respectively. Fifty five percent of Morningstar Foods products were manufactured and sold on a private label (or "customer brand") basis for customers in 2002. The remaining 45% were marketed under its proprietary or licensed brand names. Except for Silk and Sun Soy, which are manufactured and sold by our White Wave subsidiary, all of our "strategic brands" are manufactured and sold by Morningstar Foods, including: International Delight coffee creamers, Hersheys milks and milkshakes, Land OLakes ESL products, Folgers Jakada milk and coffee beverage, Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips. We license the Hersheys, Folgers and Land OLakes names from third parties for use on certain of our products. Other branded products manufactured and sold by Morningstar include Mocha Mix(R) non dairy liquid coffee creamer, Naturally Yours(TM) sour cream, Second Nature(R) egg substitute and Dairy Fresh(R) aerosol whipped toppings. Because of the nature of Morningstar Foods products most of its products are delivered by common carrier, although some of its products are distributed through our Dairy Groups DSD system. Morningstar Foods sells its products to a wide variety of retail outlets, food service customers and distributors across the United States and in a number of foreign countries through an internal sales force and independent brokers. Morningstar Foods largest customer represented approximately 9.5% of its 2002 sales. The remainder of Morningstar Foods customer base is diverse. Sales of some of Morningstars products are higher in the fourth quarter. Morningstar Foods manufactures its products in 15 plants located across the United States. For more information about Morningstar Foods manufacturing plants, see " Item 2. Properties" beginning on page 15. The primary raw materials used by Morningstar Foods are raw milk and bulk cream. We purchase our raw milk from independent farmers and farmers cooperatives, typically pursuant to contractual arrangements. Raw milk is generally readily available. The price of raw milk is regulated in most areas of the country by the 8 federal government through federal market orders and price support programs. Several states regulate raw milk pricing through their own programs. For more information about raw milk pricing in the United States, please see " Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation" beginning on page 13. Most of Morningstar Foods bulk cream requirements are supplied with excess cream from our Dairy Group. To the extent that the Dairy Group cannot fulfill all of Morningstar Foods bulk cream requirements, we purchase bulk cream from other dairy processors. Bulk cream is generally readily available and is priced based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices of raw milk and bulk cream can fluctuate widely. Other raw materials used by Morningstar Foods, such as sugar, corn syrup and packaging materials are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of Morningstars raw materials are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of our raw materials increase and decrease depending on supply and demand. Morningstar Foods competes in a number of different product markets and competition is intense in all of its markets. For most of Morningstars products, competition to obtain shelf space with retailers is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, Morningstar Foods pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many different factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. All of Morningstar Foods products compete with other food products and beverages for consumer sales. For financial reporting purposes, Morningstar Foods results are aggregated with the results of White Wave. White Wave manufactures and sells: soymilk, cultured soy, tofu (baked and raw), tempeh, and seitan. In 2002, over 90% of White Waves sales consisted of Silk branded soymilk sales. In 2002, virtually all of White Waves products were manufactured and sold under its proprietary Silk and White Wave(R) brands, with only 1% of White Waves 2002 sales consisting of private label sales. Beginning in December 2002, White Wave also assumed responsibility for our Sun Soy branded soymilk. Soymilk and cultured soy are manufactured by blending soymilk concentrate extracted from soybeans with certain proprietary ingredients. White Wave produces soymilk concentrate at two facilities that are owned or leased by the company. Due to recent rapid growth in Silk sales, both of White Waves extraction facilities were operating at full capacity by the end of 2002. Therefore, in order to meet demand, White Wave purchased approximately 30% of its 2002 soymilk concentrate requirements from third parties. In 2003, we intend to install additional extraction operations in certain of our Morningstar Foods plants. Silk products and Sun Soy are processed into finished products at three company owned plants across the country. White Wave also contracts with eight third parties to co pack Silk products at their plants. White Waves tofu, tempeh and seitan products are produced at White Waves owned facility in Boulder, Colorado. Most of White Waves products are delivered by common carrier, although some of its products are distributed through our Dairy Groups DSD system. White Wave sells its products to a variety of customers across the United States and in several foreign countries, including grocery stores, natural foods stores, club stores and convenience stores, using an internal sales force and independent brokers. Sales to White Waves largest customer represented approximately 9% of White Waves sales in 2002 since our acquisition of White Wave in May. The balance of White Waves customer base is diverse. The primary raw materials used by White Wave are organic soybeans and organic soybean concentrate. We purchase organic soybeans and organic soybean concentrate from a number of suppliers. Organic soybeans and other raw materials used by White Wave, such as organic sugar, flavorings and packaging materials, are 9 generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of White Waves raw materials are purchased under contracts in order to guarantee supply and to obtain lower costs. White Wave competes with several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, White Wave pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many different factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy. White Wave has a leading position in the soy foods category, and particularly the soymilk segment. However, soy foods and soymilk compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Net sales by Morningstar/White Wave to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $1.06 billion in 2002 (with White Waves 2002 sales only being included since its acquisition in May 2002). For more information about Morningstar/White Waves recent financial results, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" beginning on page 23 and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. SPECIALTY FOODS Our Specialty Foods segment, which we acquired as part of Old Dean, offers a diverse product mix that includes: pickles, relishes and peppers, powdered coffee creamers and other powdered products, aseptic sauces and puddings, and nutritional beverages. Our Specialty Foods division is one of the largest pickle processors and marketers in the United States. Its pickle, relish and pepper products are sold nationally, primarily under various customer brands, but also under some of our proprietary brands including Atkins(R), Cates(R), Heifetz(R), Nalleys(R), Steinfeld (TM), Farmans(R), Paramount(R), Peter Piper(R), Roddenberry(R) and Schwartz(R), and sold to foodservice customers, grocery store chains and club stores and in bulk to other food processors. Approximately half of Specialty Foods 2002 net sales to unaffiliated customers consisted of sales of pickles, relish and pepper products. Specialty Foods also sells shortening powders and other high fat powder formulas used in baking, beverage mixes, gravies and sauces, and premium and low fat powdered products sold primarily under private labels to vending operators, office beverage service companies and institutional foodservice distributors with national distribution to restaurants, schools, health care institutions, hotels and vending and fast food operators. Powdered coffee creamers are sold for private label distribution to all classes of the retail trade and in bulk to a number of other food companies for use as an ingredient in their food products. We believe that our Specialty Foods segment is the largest manufacturer of powdered non dairy coffee creamers in the United States. Sales of powdered products represented approximately one third of Specialty Foods 2002 net sales to unaffiliated customers. Specialty Foods also manufactures aseptic cheese sauce and pudding. Aseptic products are sterilized using a process which allows storage for prolonged periods without refrigeration. Our cheese sauce and pudding are sold nationally, primarily under private labels, to distributors that supply restaurants, schools, hotels and other segments of the foodservice and grocery industries. Specialty Foods also sells aseptic nutritional beverages in the meal supplement, weight loss/gain and sports categories. Nutritional beverages are primarily sold nationally, entirely under private labels, to retail grocery/drug store channels and some foodservice distributors. We believe that we are the only producer of nutritional beverages in the United States able to match premium branded quality due to our aseptic capabilities coupled with our research and 10 development expertise. Sales of aseptic products represented approximately 18% of Specialty Foods 2002 net sales to unaffiliated customers. Finally, Specialty Foods produces a number of specialty sauces, including shrimp, seafood, tarter, horseradish, chili and sweet and sour sauces, and sells them to retail grocers in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southern United States. These products are sold under the Bennetts(R) and Hoffman House(R) brand names. Due to their relatively long shelf lives, Specialty Foods products are delivered to our customers stores and warehouses primarily by common carrier. Specialty Foods has a diverse customer base, with no single customer representing more than 10% of Specialty Foods 2002 sales. The majority of Specialty Foods sales are to foodservice customers. Specialty Foods purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers. We supply seeds and advise growers regarding planting techniques. We also monitor and arrange for the control of insects, direct the harvest and, for some crops, provide automated harvesting services. Other raw materials used by Specialty Foods, such as corn syrup, soy bean oil, casein and packaging materials, are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of Specialty Foods raw materials are purchased under long term contracts in order to guarantee supply and to obtain lower costs. Specialty Foods produces its products in 11 plants located across the United States. For more information about Specialty Foods manufacturing plants, see " Item 2. Properties" beginning on page 15. Specialty Foods competes with several competitors in each of its product markets. For most of Specialty Foods products, competition to obtain shelf space with retailers is based on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. In some cases Specialty Foods pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on quality, regional taste preferences, price and brand awareness. Specialty Foods also competes with other food and nutritional products for consumer sales. Specialty Foods net sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $673.6 million in 2002. For more information about Specialty Foods recent financial results, see "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results" beginning on page 23 and Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. INTERNATIONAL Our international dairy operations consist solely of our Spanish operations conducted through Leche Celta. Products that Leche Celta manufactures include: fluid milk pasteurized at ultra high temperatures, known as "UHT" milk (including flavored and enriched milks), butter, UHT cream, and cheese. In 2002, sales of UHT fluid milk represented approximately 89% of sales, while butter, cream and cheese comprised 9%, 1%, and 1% respectively. Leche Celta manufactures its products in 4 plants located in the Galicia and Cantabria regions of Spain. For more information about Leche Celtas plants, see " Item 2. Properties" beginning on page 15. Leche Celta operates its business primarily from its headquarters located in Pontedeume, Galicia. The long shelf life of Leche Celtas UHT fluid milk products allows delivery by common carrier. Leche Celta sells its products through an internal sales force to a wide variety of customers throughout Spain and Portugal, including mainly large and mid sized retailers. In 2002, Leche Celta manufactured and marketed 11 approximately 60% of its products under its proprietary brands, including Celta(R) and Campobueno(R), and the remaining 40% under private label brands for customers. Leche Celtas largest customer is Distribucion Internacional de Alimentacion S.A., which accounted for approximately 18% of net sales to unaffiliated customers in 2002. Leche Celtas second largest customer, Eroski Sociedad Cooperativa, represented approximately 11% of net sales to unaffiliated customers in 2002. Leche Celtas sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be lower in the third quarter. The primary raw materials used by Leche Celta are raw milk and packaging materials. We purchase our raw milk from farmers cooperatives and other intermediaries pursuant to formal and informal contractual arrangements. Raw milk production volume is regulated by European Union quotas which sometimes limit the availability of these raw materials to processors. The price of raw milk is defined solely by supply and demand and can fluctuate widely. Celta purchases its packaging materials from two leading suppliers. Packaging materials represent a significant portion of Leche Celtas raw material costs and are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The Spanish fluid dairy market is characterized by relatively high per capita consumption and the UHT "brick pack" format dominates the industry. The combination of these factors makes Spain one of the largest UHT markets in the world. The Spanish fluid dairy market has been characterized over the past 20 years by slow growth in the core products and faster growth for value added products such as nutritionally enriched milks. Private label brands comprise a growing but still relatively small share of the Spanish market. The Spanish fluid dairy industry is highly competitive, with leading companies investing heavily in innovation and branding. The industry has undergone significant consolidation in the past 5 to 10 years leading to the emergence of several national brands, including the Celta(R) brand. Leche Celtas net sales to unaffiliated customers totaled approximately $199.6 million in 2002. GOVERNMENT REGULATION PUBLIC HEALTH As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorize regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing of dairy manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe that our facilities and manufacturing practices comply with all material government regulations. 12 EMPLOYEE SAFETY REGULATIONS We are subject to certain safety regulations including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS We are subject to various environmental regulations. Ammonia, a refrigerant used extensively in our operations, is considered an "extremely" hazardous substance pursuant to U.S. federal environmental laws due to its toxicity. Also, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels permitted under local regulations. Because of this, certain of our subsidiaries are required to pay waste water surcharges or to construct waste water pretreatment facilities. To date, such waste water surcharges have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain above ground or underground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. These tanks are periodically inspected to determine compliance with applicable regulations. We are required to make expenditures from time to time in order to maintain compliance of these tanks. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not expect environmental compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. MILK INDUSTRY REGULATION The federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk contains primarily raw skim milk, in addition to a small percentage of butterfat. The federal government establishes separate minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested upon receipt to determine the percentage of butterfat, and we pay producers separate prices for the raw skim milk and butterfat based on the results of our tests. The federal governments minimum prices are calculated by economic formula based on supply and demand and vary depending on the processors geographic location and the type of product manufactured using the raw product. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for butterfat and raw skim milk that is processed into fluid milk products) and Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw skim milk that is processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government by the 23rd day of the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices for each month are announced on the 5th day after the end of that month. In addition to the federal minimum prices, we also pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Some states have opted out of the federal pricing system, and have established their own methods of establishing minimum prices for raw milk. A very few states also regulate the price that we can charge our retail customers for our products. From 1996 until its expiration in October 2001, the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission set a minimum price for raw milk in New England independent of the price set by the federal milk marketing orders. Under that compact, the price we paid for raw milk in New England exceeded the price we were paying for raw milk in other parts of the country. The Northeast Dairy compact expired by its terms on October 31, 2001. Proposals are made from time to time to authorize additional state compacts or to enact new laws to regulate and set minimum levels for the price of raw milk. Proposals have also been made by various states to set limits on the price of milk charged by milk processors to retailers and on the price of milk charged by retailers to consumers. We do not know whether any such legislation will be enacted by Congress or any state, or if enacted, the extent to which any such legislation would impact our business. 13 In Spain, the government has established a quota system regulating the amount of milk that can be sold by individual farmers and farm cooperatives, which affects the manner in which we purchase raw milk, as well as the prices we pay for raw milk.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are the leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States and a leading manufacturer of specialty foods. We have five operating divisions including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, White Wave, Specialty Foods and International. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business" beginning on page 1 for a general description of our business. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, we currently have three reportable business segments: Dairy Group, Morningstar/White Wave and Specialty Foods. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2002 Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2002" for a description of recent developments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain information concerning our results of operations, including information presented as a percentage of net sales. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2002 2001 2000 DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Net sales....................... $8,991,464 100.0% $5,974,555 100.0% $5,499,712 100.0% Cost of sales................... 6,642,773 73.9 4,574,258 76.6 4,150,170 75.5 Gross profit.................... 2,348,691 26.1 1,400,297 23.4 1,349,542 24.5 Operating costs and expenses: Selling and distribution........ 1,321,763 14.7 794,937 13.3 756,445 13.7 General and administrative...... 337,496 3.8 176,642 2.9 174,353 3.2 Amortization of intangibles..... 7,775 0.1 51,361 0.9 49,776 0.9 Plant closing costs............. 19,050 0.2 9,550 0.2 2,747 0.1 Other operating (income) expense.......................

As a result, full year comparisons between 2002 and 2001, and to some degree, between 2001 and 2000 are less meaningful than they would be otherwise. We obtained our Specialty Foods segment as part of our acquisition of Old Dean. Therefore, no prior year comparisons are provided because the Specialty Foods segment was only owned for a few days in 2001. More complete segment data can be found in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, comparisons between 2002 and 2001 are less meaningful than they would be otherwise. Where appropriate, we have provided comparisons eliminating the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in 2001. See Notes 1 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding SFAS No. 142. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Net Sales Net sales increased 51% to $8.99 billion during 2002 from $5.97 billion in 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 40%, or $2.02 billion, in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisition of Old Dean (net of the plants divested as part of the transaction) contributed a net increase in sales of approximately $2.4 billion to the Dairy Group. That increase was partly offset by the effects of decreased raw milk costs compared to the prior year. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our 23 products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I "mover" and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2002 compared to 2001: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31* 2002 2001 % CHANGE Class I raw skim milk mover(3).......................... $7.01(1) $7.93(1) (12)% Class I butterfat mover(3).............................. 1.21(2) 1.89(2) (36) Class II raw skim milk minimum(4)....................... 7.62(1) 8.33(1) (9) Class II butterfat minimum(4)........................... 1.20(2) 1.86(2) (35) * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover prices plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation" beginning on page 13, and " Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk and Cream" beginning on page 34 for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) Prices are per hundredweight. (2) Prices are per pound. (3) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Groups 2002 sales were also negatively affected by certain volume decreases. On a pro forma basis as if Old Dean had been acquired on January 1, 2001 (net of the plants divested as part of the transaction), the Dairy Groups fluid milk volumes during 2002 would have been relatively flat compared to 2001, while ice cream and ice cream novelty volumes were down 4% and 7.4%, respectively. Our ice cream is sold under private labels and local brands, and we lost sales during the year to nationally branded products, which were promoted more aggressively than our products. Net sales for Morningstar/White Wave increased 42%, or $314.8 million, in 2002 compared to the prior year. We estimate that the acquisition of Old Dean added approximately $275 million of sales at our Morningstar/White Wave segment during 2002. Precise measurement of the impact of the acquisition of Old Dean on Morningstar/White Waves sales is not possible because Old Deans National Refrigerated Products segment has been fully integrated into Morningstar and is no longer accounted for separately. The acquisition of White Wave contributed approximately $113.4 million during 2002. These gains were offset by (i) the effects of lower raw milk and bulk cream costs, (ii) an approximately 10% decrease in cultured dairy product sales volumes, and (iii) the planned phase out of the Lactaid, Nestle Nesquik and Nestle Coffeemate co packing businesses. In 2002, we began tracking the sales growth of our strategic brands. Morningstar/White Waves strategic brands include Hersheys flavored milks, International Delight coffee creamers, Silk soy products, Sun Soy soymilk, Folgers Jakada milk and coffee beverage, Land OLakes extended shelf life products, Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips. On a pro forma basis as if Old Dean and White Wave had been acquired on January 1, 2001, our strategic brand sales were approximately $550 million during 2002 and strategic brand sales volumes increased approximately 28% in 2002 from 2001. Our Specialty Foods segment reported net sales of $673.6 million during 2002. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 73.9% in 2002 compared to 76.6% in 2001. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group decreased to 74.3% in 2002 from 77.3% in 2001 due primarily to lower raw milk costs and also to realized merger synergies. See "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2002" beginning on page 2. The cost of sales ratio for Morningstar/White Wave decreased to 68.1% in 2002 from 69.9% in 2001. This decrease in 2002 was due to lower raw material costs. Specialty Foods cost of sales ratio was 73.9% in 2002. 24 Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 18.8% in 2002 compared to 17% during 2001. Comparability of these ratios is significantly affected by our adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Excluding $48.4 million of amortization in 2001, our operating expense ratio would have been 16.2% in 2001, compared to 18.8% in 2002. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group was 18.3% in 2002 compared to 16.3% in 2001. Excluding approximately $39.4 million of amortization in 2001, the Dairy Groups operating expense ratio would have been 15.5% in 2001, compared to 18.3% in 2002. The increase in the 2002 operating expense ratio was primarily due to the effect of lower raw material prices in 2002 and to the impact of a gain of $47.5 million in 2001 related to the divestiture of the plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean. Lower raw material prices generally result in lower sales dollars. Therefore, falling raw milk prices will generally increase the Dairy Groups operating expense ratio and rising raw milk prices will generally reduce the Dairy Groups operating expense ratio. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar/White Wave was 21.3% during 2002 compared to 16.1% in 2001. Excluding approximately $7.2 million of amortization in 2001, the operating expense ratio would have been 15.1% in 2001, compared to 21.3% in 2002. This increase was caused primarily by higher distribution, selling and marketing expenses at Morningstar Foods related to the introduction of new products, increased spending on promotions of existing products, higher plant closing costs and the addition of White Wave, which has higher selling, marketing and distribution costs due to its efforts to build brand recognition. The ratio was also affected by significant management bonus accruals in 2002 for White Wave management. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating expense ratio for Specialty Foods was 11.4% in 2002. Operating Income Operating income during 2002 was $662.6 million, an increase of $277.5 million from 2001 operating income of $385.1 million. Our operating margin in 2002 was 7.4% compared to 6.4% in 2001. Excluding 2001 amortization that would have been eliminated had SFAS 142 been in effect last year, our operating income would have increased by $229.1 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 and our operating margin would have been 7.4% in 2002 as compared to 7.3% in 2001. The Dairy Groups operating margin, excluding amortization that would have been eliminated had SFAS 142 been in effect last year, increased slightly to 7.4% in 2002 from 7.2% in the same period of 2001. The operating margin for our Morningstar/White Wave segment, again excluding amortization that would have been eliminated had SFAS 142 been in effect last year, declined to 10.6% in 2002 from 15% in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to higher selling, distribution and marketing expenses, higher plant closing costs and the planned phase out of the Lactaid, Nestle Quik and Nestle Coffeemate co packing businesses offset by certain realized merger synergies. Specialty Foods operating margin was 14.7% in 2002. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $83.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Interest expense increased to $197.7 million in 2002 from $96.5 million in 2001 as a result of higher debt used to finance the acquisitions of Old Dean and White Wave. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was a net loss of $7.9 million in 2002 compared to a loss of $23.6 million in 2001. We recorded income of $2.1 million in 2002, which was primarily related to our 36% interest in White Wave through May 9, 2002, when we acquired the remaining equity interest in White Wave and began consolidating White Waves results with our financial results. This income was offset by a $10 million loss on our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"). During the fourth quarter of 2002, we agreed to make a $10 million loan to CCC in exchange for the cancellation of our pre existing $10 million guaranty of CCCs indebtedness and additional equity interests in CCC. The additional infusion of cash to CCC required us to record our share of CCCs 2002 losses, up to $10 million. This transaction also resulted in our ownership percentage declining to approximately 40% from 43%. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about this transaction. Our loss from unconsolidated affiliates in 2001 related primarily to our investment in CCC. In the fourth quarter of 2001 we concluded 25 that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary, and as a result we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.4% in 2002 compared to 36.7% in 2001. In 2002 and 2001, contested income tax issues were resolved in our favor. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings decreased significantly to $46 thousand in 2002 from $31.4 million in 2001. For most of 2002, management of EBI Foods, a subsidiary of our Specialty Foods segment, owned a small minority interest in that subsidiary. We sold our interest in EBI Foods in October 2002. In 2001, Dairy Farmers of America owned a 33.8% minority interest in our Dairy Group. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations On December 30, 2002, we sold our operations in Puerto Rico resulting in a loss on sale from discontinued operations of $8.2 million, including tax expense. We also recorded income from discontinued operations of $0.9 million during 2002 versus $3.6 million in 2001. All amounts attributable to our former Puerto Rico operations, for all periods, have been reclassified to "income from discontinued operations." Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change As part of our adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 we wrote down the value of certain trademarks and the goodwill related to our Puerto Rico operations which our analysis indicated were impaired. Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $85 million, net of an income tax benefit of $29 million, as a charge to earnings. During 2001, we recorded a charge of $1.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and a minority interest benefit of $0.7 million related to our adoption of SFAS 133. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Net Sales Net sales increased 8.6% to $5.97 billion during 2001 from $5.50 billion in 2000. Approximately $103.1 million of this increase was due to the acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 8.4%, or $392.2 million, in 2001, and net sales for Morningstar Foods increased 8.5%, or $57.9 million in 2001. $74.7 million and $9.7 million of these increases, respectively, are due to the sales of Old Dean being included in our results since the date of acquisition. The remaining portions of these increases were primarily due to an increase in prices charged for our products in response to higher raw milk costs, and occurred despite a small decline in volume. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I "mover" and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2001 compared to 2000: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31* 2001 2000 % CHANGE Class I raw skim milk mover(3).............................. $7.93(1) $7.72(1) 3% Class I butterfat mover(3).................................. 1.89(2) 1.17(2) 62 Class II raw skim milk minimum(4)........................... 8.33(1) 8.42(1) (1) Class II butterfat minimum(4)............................... 1.86(2) 1.26(2) 48 * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover prices plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation" beginning on page 13, and " Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk and Cream" beginning on page 34 for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) Prices are per hundredweight. 26 (2) Prices are per pound. (3) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 76.6% in 2001 compared to 75.5% in 2000. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group increased to 77.3% in 2001 from 76.1% in 2000 and the cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods increased to 69.9% in 2001 from 68.8% in 2000. These increases were due primarily to higher raw milk costs in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 17% in 2001 compared to 18% in 2000. Included in 2001 operating costs were the following one time items: A gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of the plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean (which gain represented the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants), An expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of America as consideration for modifications to our milk supply arrangements, and An expense of $1.7 million resulting from the impairment in value of a water plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Included in 2000 operating expenses were litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group was 16.3% in 2001 compared to 17.7% in 2000. This decrease was due to the one time gain of $47.5 million included in 2001 operating expenses, the increase in net sales in 2001 and various cost savings initiatives (most of which were temporary) implemented during 2001 in response to a difficult operating environment. These initiatives, which included such things as reduced travel and meeting expenses and reduced advertising and marketing expenses, resulted in lower selling and general and administrative costs during 2001. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 16.1% in 2001 versus 16.4% in 2000. Although similar cost savings initiatives were implemented at Morningstar Foods in 2001 as were implemented at the Dairy Group, their overall operating expense ratio remained steady due to higher distribution and selling expenses related to the introduction of new products. Operating Income Operating income in 2001 was $385.1 million, an increase of $26.4 million from 2000 operating income of $358.7 million. Our operating margin in 2001 was 6.4% compared to 6.5% in 2000. The Dairy Groups operating margin increased to 6.4% in 2001 from 6.2% in 2000. This increase was due to the one time gain of $47.5 million included in 2001 operating expenses partially offset by higher raw milk costs during 2001. Morningstar Foods operating margin declined to 14.1% in 2001 from 14.8% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher raw milk and bulk cream costs in 2001. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $29.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Interest expense decreased to $96.5 million in 2001 from $107.1 million in 2000. This decrease was the result of lower average debt balances and lower interest rates in 2001. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, related primarily to our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), was a loss of $23.6 million in 2001 compared to income of $11.5 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 loss was an impairment charge of $21.1 million related to the write off of our investment in CCC. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. 27 Other income and expense also included $4.4 million of impairment charges related to two other small investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.7% in 2001 compared to 39% in 2000. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of a contested state tax issue during 2001. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings, which was primarily the 33.8% ownership interest of Dairy Farmers of America in our Dairy Group, increased to $31.4 million in 2001 compared to $29.9 million in 2000. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. In 2001, we also purchased the 25% minority interest of Leche Celta. We now own 100% of our Spanish operations. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with the acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result, we recognized a $4.3 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of $3 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early retirement of our former credit facilities. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000 we recognized a $5 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended). Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a $1.4 million charge to earnings, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and minority interest benefit of $0.7 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Critical accounting policies" are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on existing promotional agreements and historical experience. On our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2002, sales were reduced by estimated incentives of $173.6 million. A 1% change in that amount would impact our reported sales by $1.7 million. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses based on historical experience. At December 31, 2002, our 28 allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $34 million, or 0.4% of sales. Each 0.1% change in that ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to sales would impact net income by approximately $5.6 million. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by our external insurance brokers and actuaries. The loss development factors are subject to change based upon actual history and expected trends in costs, among other factors. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $128.5 million and $96.1 million, respectively. Valuation of Long Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill In January 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and as a result, we no longer amortize goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives. In lieu of amortization, we are now required to perform annual impairment tests of goodwill and long lived intangibles. The annual impairment tests require the use of significant judgments and estimates. Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair value of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. For significant acquisitions, we utilize valuation specialists and appraisers to assist in the determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including identifiable intangibles. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits to our employees including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. One of the important assumptions in the pension expense is the expected rate of return on plan assets. Over the life of our pension plans we expect the plan assets to earn a return of approximately 6.75% to 8.50% depending on the type of assets in the individual plans. A 1% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $1.25 million. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $0.2 million. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement 29 obligation be recognized in the period in which the associated legal obligation for the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the asset. SFAS No. 143 will become effective for us in 2003. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was issued in April 2002 and is applicable to fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. One of the provisions of this technical statement is the rescission of SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," whereby any gain or loss on the early extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods in accordance with SFAS No. 4, which does not meet the criteria of an extraordinary item as defined by APB Opinion 30, must be reclassified. Adoption of this standard will require us to reclassify extraordinary losses previously reported from the early extinguishment of debt as a component of "other expense." For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $4.3 million, net of an income tax benefit of $3 million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. In June 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." The statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Our adoption of this standard will change the timing of the recognition of certain charges associated with exit and disposal activities. On December 31, 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," which amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS No. 148, which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method and requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation. At this time, we have elected not to adopt the voluntary expense recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. In November 2002, FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies" relating to the guarantors accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued. FIN No. 45 requires disclosures of guarantees. It also requires liability recognition for the fair value of guarantees made after December 31, 2002. We will adopt the liability recognition requirements of FIN No. 45 effective January 1, 2003, and we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or in which equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks. The interpretation applies to variable interest entities ("VIEs") created after January 31, 2003 and to VIEs in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the fiscal or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before February 1, 2003. We currently utilize special purpose limited liability entities to facilitate our receivables backed loan and our trust issued preferred securities. Since their formations, these entities have been consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, FIN No. 46 will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW During 2002, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $642.6 million for 2002 as contrasted to $305.2 million for 2001, an increase of $337.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: An increase of $172.5 million in net income from continuing operations plus non cash items in 2002 as compared to 2001; and Changes in assets and liabilities which improved by $164.9 million in 2002 compared to the previous year. Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations was $309.1 million in 2002 compared to $1.27 billion in 2001, a decrease of $965.6 million. We used approximately $242 million for capital expenditures and approximately $222.1 million for acquisitions. We had cash proceeds from the divestiture of Puerto Rico and three other small businesses in 2002 of $148.3 million. We used approximately $87.2 million to repurchase our stock and received approximately $75 million primarily as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. We used a net amount of $355.3 million to repay indebtedness. CURRENT DEBT OBLIGATIONS Effective December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new $2.7 billion senior credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800 million and two term loans in the amounts of $900 million and $1 billion, respectively. Both term loans have been fully funded since completion of the Old Dean acquisition. The proceeds of the term loans were used to retire our former credit facilities and Old Deans former credit facility, to purchase DFAs ownership stake in our Dairy Group, and to pay certain other obligations. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio (computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness to defined EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (computed as the ratio of defined EBITDA to defined interest expense). In addition, this facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth (as defined by the agreement). The agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt and certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of our credit agreement, including interest rates, principal payment schedules and mandatory prepayment provisions. At December 31, 2002 we had outstanding borrowings of $1.83 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2001) all of which was outstanding under our two term loans. The revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2002, except for $71.8 million of letters of credit that were issued but undrawn. As of December 31, 2002 approximately $728.2 million was available for future borrowings under our credit facility. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $400 million receivables backed credit facility, which had $145 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables backed facility. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2002 included $700 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Old Deans senior notes, $35.7 million of term indebtedness and an $11.9 million line of credit at our Spanish subsidiary, $21 million of industrial development revenue bonds and approximately $29.8 million of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness and lease obligations at December 31, 2002. Please see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail about our lease obligations.

In addition to the letters of credit secured by our senior credit facility, at December 31, 2002 we had approximately $49 million of letters of credit with three other banks that were issued but undrawn. The majority of these were required by various utilities and government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. We recorded noncash expense of $9.1 million and $1.3 million related to pensions in 2002 and 2001, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87. As of December 31, 2002, key assumptions of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans were revised, including decreasing the expected return on plan assets from 9% to 8.5% and decreasing the assumed discount rate in 2002 from 7.25% to 6.75%. In selecting assumed discount rates, we considered fixed income security yield rates for AA rated portfolios as reported by Moodys. In selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets, we considered past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan. Plan asset values have declined $19.7 million and $5.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Reported pension costs for our plans are expected to increase in 2003 by approximately $2.6 million as the result of these changed assumptions. Further, based on the current decreases in the market value of our plan assets, we anticipate an increase in the 2003 funding requirements. Pension cost and cash funding requirements could increase in future years if current market conditions persist. 32 As a result of our plan asset return experience, at December 31, 2002, we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits." The additional liability, which totaled $18.7 million ($11.5 million after tax), was recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income, and did not affect net income for 2002. The charge to Other Comprehensive Income will be reversed in future periods to the extent the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. See Notes 14 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA") in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our plants until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Because this note was delivered in connection with our acquisition of DFAs minority interest in our Dairy Group, we originally recorded the note as part of the purchase consideration and it was reflected on our balance sheet in "other long term liabilities." However, we now believe that payments we make under this note, if any, should be expensed as incurred. Accordingly, the related purchase consideration and the note obligation have been removed from our 2001 balance sheet. Also in connection with our purchase of DFAs minority interest in our Dairy Group, we agreed to pay to DFA liquidated damages in an amount of up to $47 million if we fail to offer them the right, within a specified period of time after completion of the Old Dean acquisition, to supply raw milk to certain of Old Deans plants. The amount of damages to be paid, if any, would be determined on a plant by plant basis for each plants milk supply that is not offered to DFA, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by the plants. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this agreement. At this time, we cannot estimate the amount of damages that we may have to pay, if any. We also have the following contingent obligations, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation and audits: the obligation to pay performance bonuses to White Waves management team in the event that established performance hurdles are met by March 2004 (which bonuses we currently expect to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million); and certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our contingent obligations. PREFERRED SECURITIES On March 24, 1998, we issued $600 million of company obligated 5.5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 5.5% preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.5% of their liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 15.3 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, at a 33 conversion price of $39.13. These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time at specified premiums and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On March 17, 2003, we announced a partial redemption of our trust issued preferred securities ("TIPES"). TIPES with an aggregate liquidation value of $100 million will be redeemed on April 17, 2003 at a redemption price of $51.0315 per security. Holders of TIPES that have been called for redemption have the option to convert their TIPES into shares of our common stock instead of receiving the cash redemption price. Approximately $500 million of TIPES will remain outstanding following completion of this partial redemption. FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS During 2003, we intend to invest a total of approximately $300 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. We intend to spend this amount as follows: OPERATING DIVISION AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Dairy Group........................................ $195 Morningstar/White Wave............................. 75 Specialty Foods.................................... 15 Other.............................................. 15 $300 We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions that are compatible with our core business strategy. We may also repurchase our securities pursuant to open market or privately negotiated transactions. Approximately $171.6 million was available for spending under our stock repurchase program as of March 25, 2003. We base our decisions regarding when to repurchase securities on a variety of factors, including primarily an analysis of the optimal use of available capital, taking into account the market value of our securities, the relative expected return on alternative investments and the limitations imposed by our credit facility. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Any acquisitions or securities repurchases will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our senior credit facility. If necessary, we believe that we have the ability to secure additional financing for our future capital requirements. KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT As a result of the economic downturn in this country, many of our retail customers have experienced economic difficulty over the past year. A number of our customers have been forced to close stores and certain others have sought bankruptcy protection. This trend, if it continues, could have a material adverse affect on us if a material number of our customers, or any one large customer, were to be forced to close a significant number of stores or file for bankruptcy protection. PRICES OF RAW MILK AND CREAM In our Dairy Group and Morningstar/White Wave segments, our raw milk cost changes are based on the federal and certain state governments minimum prices, regional and national milk supply conditions and arrangements with our suppliers. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain 34 producer premiums (or "over order" premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw material cost, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in the commodity environment can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. Bulk cream is also a significant raw material cost to the Dairy Group and Morningstar Foods. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Bulk cream is used in our Class II products such as ice cream, ice cream mix, creams and creamers, sour cream and cottage cheese. In 2002, prices for raw milk and butter were very low. Although we cannot predict future raw material prices with precision, we do expect prices to increase in 2003. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, and in some cases we are contractually or competitively restrained with respect to the means and timing of implementing price changes. Also, at some point price increases do erode our volumes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margins tend to fluctuate with the price of our raw materials. TAX RATE Our 2002 tax rate was approximately 36.4%. However, we believe that our effective tax rate will be approximately 38% for the next several years. Our 2002 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of a contested income tax issue. See " Risk Factors" for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. RISK FACTORS This report contains statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact. Most of these statements are found in this report under the following subheadings: "Part I Item 1. Business," "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our businesses are subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. Our failure to successfully compete against our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our competitors, especially those with nationally branded products that compete with our nationally branded products, have significantly greater resources than we do. Also, in many cases, those nationally branded products have significantly more name recognition and longer histories of success. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is especially important to the growth of our Dairy Group, as demand tends to be relatively flat in the dairy industry. Many of our Dairy Group retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current economic environment and we have recently been subject to a number of intensely competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group. The current competitive environment could result in margin erosion in our 35 Dairy Group, or the loss of certain customers altogether. In 2002, we lost several key local and regional grocery customers as a result of pricing battles with our competitors. Loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have long term contracts with many of our largest customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could be adversely affected if any one or more of our existing customers were to decide to establish captive dairy operations, or be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR BRANDING EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources toward the growth of our branded, value added portfolio of products, particularly at our Morningstar/White Wave segment. We believe that sales of these products could be a significant source of growth for our business. However, the success of our efforts will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our branded products, of which there can be no assurance. If our efforts do not succeed, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk and bulk cream, and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand, and, in some cases, governmental regulation. Weather affects the available supply of raw milk and cream. Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. Our White Wave operating unit is also sensitive to adverse weather due to its reliance on soybeans. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. Although we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs, we do expect raw material prices to increase in 2003. Because our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to customers through its "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of fuel. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. We are also a significant consumer of electricity, so any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources" beginning on page 31. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. 36 Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies. LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF OUR LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Hersheys(R), Borden(R), Pet(R), Folgers(R), Land O Lakes(R) and others. In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. NEGATIVE HEALTH CLAIMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US As a manufacturer of food products, positive or negative publicity or medical research regarding the health effects of the types of foods that we produce affects us. For example, recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE" or "mad cow disease") in other countries have raised public concern about the safety of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal derived products. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted to milk. However, we are still subject to risk as a result of public perception that milk products may be affected by mad cow disease. To date, we have not seen any measurable impact on our milk sales resulting from concerns about mad cow disease. However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease or for any other reason, we could suffer a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial results. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as: product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverages. Although we maintain quality control programs designed to address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could result in: product withdrawals, product recalls, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 37 LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our success depends to a large extent on the skills, experience and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of these persons could hurt our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, directors or other employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business will be adversely affected. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or change of control. Our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors, divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year, permit directors to be removed only for cause, and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of our voting stock. We also have a stockholder rights plan. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events, our stockholders will be able to buy stock from us or our successor at reduced prices. These rights do not extend, however, to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors. Accordingly, this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2002: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS (IN MILLIONS) 6.23%................................................ June 2003 $ 50 4.29% to 4.69%....................................... December 2003 275 4.01% to 6.69%....................................... December 2004 275 5.20% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 400 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75 38 The following table summarizes our various interest rate agreements as of December 31, 2001: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS (IN MILLIONS) 4.90% to 4.93%....................................... December 2002 $275 6.07% to 6.24%....................................... December 2002 325 6.23%................................................ June 2003 50 6.69%................................................ December 2004 100 6.69% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 100 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75 In January 2003, we entered into forward starting swaps that begin in March 2003 with a notional amount of $400 million. These swaps all expire in December 2003 and the fixed interest rates range between 1.47% to 1.48%. These swaps have been designated as hedges against interest rate exposure on loans under our senior credit facility. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges for loans under Leche Celtas term loan. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes these agreements as of December 31, 2002 and 2001: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS 5.54% November 2003 9 million euros (approximately $9.4 million as of December 31, 2002 and $8.0 million as of December 31, 2001) 5.60% November 2004 12 million euros (approximately $12.6 million as of December 31, 2002 and $10.7 million as of December 31, 2001) We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $24 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2002 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. FOREIGN CURRENCY We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro. At this time, we believe that potential losses due to foreign currency fluctuations would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 39 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are the leading processor and distributor of milk and other dairy products in the United States and a leading manufacturer of specialty foods. We have five operating divisions including Dairy Group, Morningstar Foods, White Wave, Specialty Foods and International. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business" beginning on page 1 for a general description of our business. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, we currently have three reportable business segments: Dairy Group, Morningstar/White Wave and Specialty Foods. DEVELOPMENTS SINCE JANUARY 1, 2002 Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2002" for a description of recent developments. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table presents certain information concerning our results of operations, including information presented as a percentage of net sales. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31 2002 2001 2000 DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT DOLLARS PERCENT (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Net sales....................... $8,991,464 100.0% $5,974,555 100.0% $5,499,712 100.0% Cost of sales................... 6,642,773 73.9 4,574,258 76.6 4,150,170 75.5 Gross profit.................... 2,348,691 26.1 1,400,297 23.4 1,349,542 24.5 Operating costs and expenses: Selling and distribution........ 1,321,763 14.7 794,937 13.3 756,445 13.7 General and administrative...... 337,496 3.8 176,642 2.9 174,353 3.2 Amortization of intangibles..... 7,775 0.1 51,361 0.9 49,776 0.9 Plant closing costs............. 19,050 0.2 9,550 0.2 2,747 0.1 Other operating (income) expense.......................

As a result, full year comparisons between 2002 and 2001, and to some degree, between 2001 and 2000 are less meaningful than they would be otherwise. We obtained our Specialty Foods segment as part of our acquisition of Old Dean. Therefore, no prior year comparisons are provided because the Specialty Foods segment was only owned for a few days in 2001. More complete segment data can be found in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, comparisons between 2002 and 2001 are less meaningful than they would be otherwise. Where appropriate, we have provided comparisons eliminating the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in 2001. See Notes 1 and 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding SFAS No. 142. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 Net Sales Net sales increased 51% to $8.99 billion during 2002 from $5.97 billion in 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 40%, or $2.02 billion, in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisition of Old Dean (net of the plants divested as part of the transaction) contributed a net increase in sales of approximately $2.4 billion to the Dairy Group. That increase was partly offset by the effects of decreased raw milk costs compared to the prior year. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our 23 products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I "mover" and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2002 compared to 2001: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31* 2002 2001 % CHANGE Class I raw skim milk mover(3).......................... $7.01(1) $7.93(1) (12)% Class I butterfat mover(3).............................. 1.21(2) 1.89(2) (36) Class II raw skim milk minimum(4)....................... 7.62(1) 8.33(1) (9) Class II butterfat minimum(4)........................... 1.20(2) 1.86(2) (35) * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover prices plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation" beginning on page 13, and " Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk and Cream" beginning on page 34 for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) Prices are per hundredweight. (2) Prices are per pound. (3) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Groups 2002 sales were also negatively affected by certain volume decreases. On a pro forma basis as if Old Dean had been acquired on January 1, 2001 (net of the plants divested as part of the transaction), the Dairy Groups fluid milk volumes during 2002 would have been relatively flat compared to 2001, while ice cream and ice cream novelty volumes were down 4% and 7.4%, respectively. Our ice cream is sold under private labels and local brands, and we lost sales during the year to nationally branded products, which were promoted more aggressively than our products. Net sales for Morningstar/White Wave increased 42%, or $314.8 million, in 2002 compared to the prior year. We estimate that the acquisition of Old Dean added approximately $275 million of sales at our Morningstar/White Wave segment during 2002. Precise measurement of the impact of the acquisition of Old Dean on Morningstar/White Waves sales is not possible because Old Deans National Refrigerated Products segment has been fully integrated into Morningstar and is no longer accounted for separately. The acquisition of White Wave contributed approximately $113.4 million during 2002. These gains were offset by (i) the effects of lower raw milk and bulk cream costs, (ii) an approximately 10% decrease in cultured dairy product sales volumes, and (iii) the planned phase out of the Lactaid, Nestle Nesquik and Nestle Coffeemate co packing businesses. In 2002, we began tracking the sales growth of our strategic brands. Morningstar/White Waves strategic brands include Hersheys flavored milks, International Delight coffee creamers, Silk soy products, Sun Soy soymilk, Folgers Jakada milk and coffee beverage, Land OLakes extended shelf life products, Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips. On a pro forma basis as if Old Dean and White Wave had been acquired on January 1, 2001, our strategic brand sales were approximately $550 million during 2002 and strategic brand sales volumes increased approximately 28% in 2002 from 2001. Our Specialty Foods segment reported net sales of $673.6 million during 2002. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 73.9% in 2002 compared to 76.6% in 2001. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group decreased to 74.3% in 2002 from 77.3% in 2001 due primarily to lower raw milk costs and also to realized merger synergies. See "Part I Item 1. Business Developments Since January 1, 2002" beginning on page 2. The cost of sales ratio for Morningstar/White Wave decreased to 68.1% in 2002 from 69.9% in 2001. This decrease in 2002 was due to lower raw material costs. Specialty Foods cost of sales ratio was 73.9% in 2002. 24 Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 18.8% in 2002 compared to 17% during 2001. Comparability of these ratios is significantly affected by our adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. Excluding $48.4 million of amortization in 2001, our operating expense ratio would have been 16.2% in 2001, compared to 18.8% in 2002. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group was 18.3% in 2002 compared to 16.3% in 2001. Excluding approximately $39.4 million of amortization in 2001, the Dairy Groups operating expense ratio would have been 15.5% in 2001, compared to 18.3% in 2002. The increase in the 2002 operating expense ratio was primarily due to the effect of lower raw material prices in 2002 and to the impact of a gain of $47.5 million in 2001 related to the divestiture of the plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean. Lower raw material prices generally result in lower sales dollars. Therefore, falling raw milk prices will generally increase the Dairy Groups operating expense ratio and rising raw milk prices will generally reduce the Dairy Groups operating expense ratio. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar/White Wave was 21.3% during 2002 compared to 16.1% in 2001. Excluding approximately $7.2 million of amortization in 2001, the operating expense ratio would have been 15.1% in 2001, compared to 21.3% in 2002. This increase was caused primarily by higher distribution, selling and marketing expenses at Morningstar Foods related to the introduction of new products, increased spending on promotions of existing products, higher plant closing costs and the addition of White Wave, which has higher selling, marketing and distribution costs due to its efforts to build brand recognition. The ratio was also affected by significant management bonus accruals in 2002 for White Wave management. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The operating expense ratio for Specialty Foods was 11.4% in 2002. Operating Income Operating income during 2002 was $662.6 million, an increase of $277.5 million from 2001 operating income of $385.1 million. Our operating margin in 2002 was 7.4% compared to 6.4% in 2001. Excluding 2001 amortization that would have been eliminated had SFAS 142 been in effect last year, our operating income would have increased by $229.1 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 and our operating margin would have been 7.4% in 2002 as compared to 7.3% in 2001. The Dairy Groups operating margin, excluding amortization that would have been eliminated had SFAS 142 been in effect last year, increased slightly to 7.4% in 2002 from 7.2% in the same period of 2001. The operating margin for our Morningstar/White Wave segment, again excluding amortization that would have been eliminated had SFAS 142 been in effect last year, declined to 10.6% in 2002 from 15% in 2001. This decrease was primarily due to higher selling, distribution and marketing expenses, higher plant closing costs and the planned phase out of the Lactaid, Nestle Quik and Nestle Coffeemate co packing businesses offset by certain realized merger synergies. Specialty Foods operating margin was 14.7% in 2002. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $83.3 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Interest expense increased to $197.7 million in 2002 from $96.5 million in 2001 as a result of higher debt used to finance the acquisitions of Old Dean and White Wave. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was a net loss of $7.9 million in 2002 compared to a loss of $23.6 million in 2001. We recorded income of $2.1 million in 2002, which was primarily related to our 36% interest in White Wave through May 9, 2002, when we acquired the remaining equity interest in White Wave and began consolidating White Waves results with our financial results. This income was offset by a $10 million loss on our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"). During the fourth quarter of 2002, we agreed to make a $10 million loan to CCC in exchange for the cancellation of our pre existing $10 million guaranty of CCCs indebtedness and additional equity interests in CCC. The additional infusion of cash to CCC required us to record our share of CCCs 2002 losses, up to $10 million. This transaction also resulted in our ownership percentage declining to approximately 40% from 43%. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about this transaction. Our loss from unconsolidated affiliates in 2001 related primarily to our investment in CCC. In the fourth quarter of 2001 we concluded 25 that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary, and as a result we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.4% in 2002 compared to 36.7% in 2001. In 2002 and 2001, contested income tax issues were resolved in our favor. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings decreased significantly to $46 thousand in 2002 from $31.4 million in 2001. For most of 2002, management of EBI Foods, a subsidiary of our Specialty Foods segment, owned a small minority interest in that subsidiary. We sold our interest in EBI Foods in October 2002. In 2001, Dairy Farmers of America owned a 33.8% minority interest in our Dairy Group. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations On December 30, 2002, we sold our operations in Puerto Rico resulting in a loss on sale from discontinued operations of $8.2 million, including tax expense. We also recorded income from discontinued operations of $0.9 million during 2002 versus $3.6 million in 2001. All amounts attributable to our former Puerto Rico operations, for all periods, have been reclassified to "income from discontinued operations." Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change As part of our adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 we wrote down the value of certain trademarks and the goodwill related to our Puerto Rico operations which our analysis indicated were impaired. Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $85 million, net of an income tax benefit of $29 million, as a charge to earnings. During 2001, we recorded a charge of $1.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and a minority interest benefit of $0.7 million related to our adoption of SFAS 133. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 Net Sales Net sales increased 8.6% to $5.97 billion during 2001 from $5.50 billion in 2000. Approximately $103.1 million of this increase was due to the acquisition of Old Dean on December 21, 2001. Net sales for the Dairy Group increased 8.4%, or $392.2 million, in 2001, and net sales for Morningstar Foods increased 8.5%, or $57.9 million in 2001. $74.7 million and $9.7 million of these increases, respectively, are due to the sales of Old Dean being included in our results since the date of acquisition. The remaining portions of these increases were primarily due to an increase in prices charged for our products in response to higher raw milk costs, and occurred despite a small decline in volume. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I "mover" and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2001 compared to 2000: YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31* 2001 2000 % CHANGE Class I raw skim milk mover(3).............................. $7.93(1) $7.72(1) 3% Class I butterfat mover(3).................................. 1.89(2) 1.17(2) 62 Class II raw skim milk minimum(4)........................... 8.33(1) 8.42(1) (1) Class II butterfat minimum(4)............................... 1.86(2) 1.26(2) 48 * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover prices plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see "Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation" beginning on page 13, and " Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk and Cream" beginning on page 34 for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) Prices are per hundredweight. 26 (2) Prices are per pound. (3) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams, ice cream and sour cream. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales ratio was 76.6% in 2001 compared to 75.5% in 2000. The cost of sales ratio for the Dairy Group increased to 77.3% in 2001 from 76.1% in 2000 and the cost of sales ratio for Morningstar Foods increased to 69.9% in 2001 from 68.8% in 2000. These increases were due primarily to higher raw milk costs in 2001. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expense ratio was 17% in 2001 compared to 18% in 2000. Included in 2001 operating costs were the following one time items: A gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of the plants transferred to National Dairy Holdings (as assignee of Dairy Farmers of America) in connection with the acquisition of Old Dean (which gain represented the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the plants), An expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to Dairy Farmers of America as consideration for modifications to our milk supply arrangements, and An expense of $1.7 million resulting from the impairment in value of a water plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Included in 2000 operating expenses were litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. The operating expense ratio at the Dairy Group was 16.3% in 2001 compared to 17.7% in 2000. This decrease was due to the one time gain of $47.5 million included in 2001 operating expenses, the increase in net sales in 2001 and various cost savings initiatives (most of which were temporary) implemented during 2001 in response to a difficult operating environment. These initiatives, which included such things as reduced travel and meeting expenses and reduced advertising and marketing expenses, resulted in lower selling and general and administrative costs during 2001. The operating expense ratio at Morningstar Foods was 16.1% in 2001 versus 16.4% in 2000. Although similar cost savings initiatives were implemented at Morningstar Foods in 2001 as were implemented at the Dairy Group, their overall operating expense ratio remained steady due to higher distribution and selling expenses related to the introduction of new products. Operating Income Operating income in 2001 was $385.1 million, an increase of $26.4 million from 2000 operating income of $358.7 million. Our operating margin in 2001 was 6.4% compared to 6.5% in 2000. The Dairy Groups operating margin increased to 6.4% in 2001 from 6.2% in 2000. This increase was due to the one time gain of $47.5 million included in 2001 operating expenses partially offset by higher raw milk costs during 2001. Morningstar Foods operating margin declined to 14.1% in 2001 from 14.8% in 2000. This decrease was due to higher raw milk and bulk cream costs in 2001. Other (Income) Expense Total other expense increased by $29.6 million in 2001 compared to 2000. Interest expense decreased to $96.5 million in 2001 from $107.1 million in 2000. This decrease was the result of lower average debt balances and lower interest rates in 2001. Financing charges on preferred securities were $33.6 million in both years. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates, related primarily to our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company ("CCC"), was a loss of $23.6 million in 2001 compared to income of $11.5 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 loss was an impairment charge of $21.1 million related to the write off of our investment in CCC. During 2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC consistently reported operating results that were significantly weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of CCCs performance in 2001, CCC became unable to comply with the financial covenants contained in its credit facility. Accordingly, we concluded that our investment in CCC was impaired and that the impairment was not temporary. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we wrote off our remaining investment in CCC. 27 Other income and expense also included $4.4 million of impairment charges related to two other small investments. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 36.7% in 2001 compared to 39% in 2000. This decrease was due primarily to the favorable settlement of a contested state tax issue during 2001. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes, and as tax savings initiatives are adopted. Minority Interest Minority interest in earnings, which was primarily the 33.8% ownership interest of Dairy Farmers of America in our Dairy Group, increased to $31.4 million in 2001 compared to $29.9 million in 2000. On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we purchased the 33.8% stake that was owned by Dairy Farmers of America. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We now own 100% of our Dairy Group. In 2001, we also purchased the 25% minority interest of Leche Celta. We now own 100% of our Spanish operations. Extraordinary Gain (Loss) On December 21, 2001, simultaneously with the acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new credit facility. As a result, we recognized a $4.3 million extraordinary loss, net of an income tax benefit of $3 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs related to the early retirement of our former credit facilities. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2000 we recognized a $5 million extraordinary gain, net of income tax expense of $2.8 million, which included the following items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit facility: A $6.5 million gain, net of income tax expense of $3.6 million, for interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair market value, and A $1.5 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $0.8 million, for the write off of deferred financing costs. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change Effective January 1, 2001 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (as amended). Our adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a $1.4 million charge to earnings, net of an income tax benefit of $1.5 million and minority interest benefit of $0.7 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES "Critical accounting policies" are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds. Revenue is reduced by sales incentives that are recorded by estimating expense based on existing promotional agreements and historical experience. On our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2002, sales were reduced by estimated incentives of $173.6 million. A 1% change in that amount would impact our reported sales by $1.7 million. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses based on historical experience. At December 31, 2002, our 28 allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $34 million, or 0.4% of sales. Each 0.1% change in that ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to sales would impact net income by approximately $5.6 million. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors provided by our external insurance brokers and actuaries. The loss development factors are subject to change based upon actual history and expected trends in costs, among other factors. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $128.5 million and $96.1 million, respectively. Valuation of Long Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill In January 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and as a result, we no longer amortize goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives. In lieu of amortization, we are now required to perform annual impairment tests of goodwill and long lived intangibles. The annual impairment tests require the use of significant judgments and estimates. Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is evaluated and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair value of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. For significant acquisitions, we utilize valuation specialists and appraisers to assist in the determination of the fair value of long lived assets, including identifiable intangibles. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits to our employees including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. One of the important assumptions in the pension expense is the expected rate of return on plan assets. Over the life of our pension plans we expect the plan assets to earn a return of approximately 6.75% to 8.50% depending on the type of assets in the individual plans. A 1% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $1.25 million. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $0.2 million. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement 29 obligation be recognized in the period in which the associated legal obligation for the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and amortized over the useful life of the asset. SFAS No. 143 will become effective for us in 2003. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections," was issued in April 2002 and is applicable to fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. One of the provisions of this technical statement is the rescission of SFAS No. 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt," whereby any gain or loss on the early extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods in accordance with SFAS No. 4, which does not meet the criteria of an extraordinary item as defined by APB Opinion 30, must be reclassified. Adoption of this standard will require us to reclassify extraordinary losses previously reported from the early extinguishment of debt as a component of "other expense." For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $4.3 million, net of an income tax benefit of $3 million in connection with the early extinguishment of debt. In June 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3, "Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)." The statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Our adoption of this standard will change the timing of the recognition of certain charges associated with exit and disposal activities. On December 31, 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure," which amends SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS No. 148, which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method and requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation. At this time, we have elected not to adopt the voluntary expense recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123. In November 2002, FASB issued FASB Interpretation ("FIN") No. 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN No. 45 clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies" relating to the guarantors accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued. FIN No. 45 requires disclosures of guarantees. It also requires liability recognition for the fair value of guarantees made after December 31, 2002. We will adopt the liability recognition requirements of FIN No. 45 effective January 1, 2003, and we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued FIN No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN No. 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements," to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or in which equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks. The interpretation applies to variable interest entities ("VIEs") created after January 31, 2003 and to VIEs in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the fiscal or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before February 1, 2003. We currently utilize special purpose limited liability entities to facilitate our receivables backed loan and our trust issued preferred securities. Since their formations, these entities have been consolidated in our financial statements for financial reporting purposes. Therefore, FIN No. 46 will have no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOW During 2002, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $642.6 million for 2002 as contrasted to $305.2 million for 2001, an increase of $337.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: An increase of $172.5 million in net income from continuing operations plus non cash items in 2002 as compared to 2001; and Changes in assets and liabilities which improved by $164.9 million in 2002 compared to the previous year. Net cash used in investing activities for continuing operations was $309.1 million in 2002 compared to $1.27 billion in 2001, a decrease of $965.6 million. We used approximately $242 million for capital expenditures and approximately $222.1 million for acquisitions. We had cash proceeds from the divestiture of Puerto Rico and three other small businesses in 2002 of $148.3 million. We used approximately $87.2 million to repurchase our stock and received approximately $75 million primarily as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. We used a net amount of $355.3 million to repay indebtedness. CURRENT DEBT OBLIGATIONS Effective December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we replaced our former credit facilities with a new $2.7 billion senior credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders. This facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to $800 million and two term loans in the amounts of $900 million and $1 billion, respectively. Both term loans have been fully funded since completion of the Old Dean acquisition. The proceeds of the term loans were used to retire our former credit facilities and Old Deans former credit facility, to purchase DFAs ownership stake in our Dairy Group, and to pay certain other obligations. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio (computed as the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness to defined EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (computed as the ratio of defined EBITDA to defined interest expense). In addition, this facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth (as defined by the agreement). The agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the agreement, default on certain of our other debt and certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our debt rating. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the terms of our credit agreement, including interest rates, principal payment schedules and mandatory prepayment provisions. At December 31, 2002 we had outstanding borrowings of $1.83 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $1.9 billion at December 31, 2001) all of which was outstanding under our two term loans. The revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2002, except for $71.8 million of letters of credit that were issued but undrawn. As of December 31, 2002 approximately $728.2 million was available for future borrowings under our credit facility. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $400 million receivables backed credit facility, which had $145 million outstanding at December 31, 2002. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables backed facility. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2002 included $700 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Old Deans senior notes, $35.7 million of term indebtedness and an $11.9 million line of credit at our Spanish subsidiary, $21 million of industrial development revenue bonds and approximately $29.8 million of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness and lease obligations at December 31, 2002. Please see Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail about our lease obligations.

In addition to the letters of credit secured by our senior credit facility, at December 31, 2002 we had approximately $49 million of letters of credit with three other banks that were issued but undrawn. The majority of these were required by various utilities and government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. We recorded noncash expense of $9.1 million and $1.3 million related to pensions in 2002 and 2001, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87. As of December 31, 2002, key assumptions of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans were revised, including decreasing the expected return on plan assets from 9% to 8.5% and decreasing the assumed discount rate in 2002 from 7.25% to 6.75%. In selecting assumed discount rates, we considered fixed income security yield rates for AA rated portfolios as reported by Moodys. In selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets, we considered past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan. Plan asset values have declined $19.7 million and $5.2 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Reported pension costs for our plans are expected to increase in 2003 by approximately $2.6 million as the result of these changed assumptions. Further, based on the current decreases in the market value of our plan assets, we anticipate an increase in the 2003 funding requirements. Pension cost and cash funding requirements could increase in future years if current market conditions persist. 32 As a result of our plan asset return experience, at December 31, 2002, we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," and SFAS No. 132, "Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits." The additional liability, which totaled $18.7 million ($11.5 million after tax), was recorded as a reduction to shareholders equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income, and did not affect net income for 2002. The charge to Other Comprehensive Income will be reversed in future periods to the extent the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. See Notes 14 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Old Dean, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America ("DFA") in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our plants until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Because this note was delivered in connection with our acquisition of DFAs minority interest in our Dairy Group, we originally recorded the note as part of the purchase consideration and it was reflected on our balance sheet in "other long term liabilities." However, we now believe that payments we make under this note, if any, should be expensed as incurred. Accordingly, the related purchase consideration and the note obligation have been removed from our 2001 balance sheet. Also in connection with our purchase of DFAs minority interest in our Dairy Group, we agreed to pay to DFA liquidated damages in an amount of up to $47 million if we fail to offer them the right, within a specified period of time after completion of the Old Dean acquisition, to supply raw milk to certain of Old Deans plants. The amount of damages to be paid, if any, would be determined on a plant by plant basis for each plants milk supply that is not offered to DFA, based generally on the amount of raw milk used by the plants. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this agreement. At this time, we cannot estimate the amount of damages that we may have to pay, if any. We also have the following contingent obligations, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation and audits: the obligation to pay performance bonuses to White Waves management team in the event that established performance hurdles are met by March 2004 (which bonuses we currently expect to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million); and certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our contingent obligations. PREFERRED SECURITIES On March 24, 1998, we issued $600 million of company obligated 5.5% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to "qualified institutional buyers" under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The 5.5% preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, mature 30 years from the date of issue. Holders of these securities are entitled to receive preferential cumulative cash distributions at an annual rate of 5.5% of their liquidation preference of $50 each. These distributions are payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year. These trust issued preferred securities are convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 15.3 million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, at a 33 conversion price of $39.13. These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at any time at specified premiums and are mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. On March 17, 2003, we announced a partial redemption of our trust issued preferred securities ("TIPES"). TIPES with an aggregate liquidation value of $100 million will be redeemed on April 17, 2003 at a redemption price of $51.0315 per security. Holders of TIPES that have been called for redemption have the option to convert their TIPES into shares of our common stock instead of receiving the cash redemption price. Approximately $500 million of TIPES will remain outstanding following completion of this partial redemption. FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS During 2003, we intend to invest a total of approximately $300 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. We intend to spend this amount as follows: OPERATING DIVISION AMOUNT (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Dairy Group........................................ $195 Morningstar/White Wave............................. 75 Specialty Foods.................................... 15 Other.............................................. 15 $300 We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. In the future, we may pursue additional acquisitions that are compatible with our core business strategy. We may also repurchase our securities pursuant to open market or privately negotiated transactions. Approximately $171.6 million was available for spending under our stock repurchase program as of March 25, 2003. We base our decisions regarding when to repurchase securities on a variety of factors, including primarily an analysis of the optimal use of available capital, taking into account the market value of our securities, the relative expected return on alternative investments and the limitations imposed by our credit facility. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Any acquisitions or securities repurchases will be funded through cash flows from operations or borrowings under our senior credit facility. If necessary, we believe that we have the ability to secure additional financing for our future capital requirements. KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT As a result of the economic downturn in this country, many of our retail customers have experienced economic difficulty over the past year. A number of our customers have been forced to close stores and certain others have sought bankruptcy protection. This trend, if it continues, could have a material adverse affect on us if a material number of our customers, or any one large customer, were to be forced to close a significant number of stores or file for bankruptcy protection. PRICES OF RAW MILK AND CREAM In our Dairy Group and Morningstar/White Wave segments, our raw milk cost changes are based on the federal and certain state governments minimum prices, regional and national milk supply conditions and arrangements with our suppliers. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain 34 producer premiums (or "over order" premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw material cost, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in the commodity environment can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. Bulk cream is also a significant raw material cost to the Dairy Group and Morningstar Foods. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Bulk cream is used in our Class II products such as ice cream, ice cream mix, creams and creamers, sour cream and cottage cheese. In 2002, prices for raw milk and butter were very low. Although we cannot predict future raw material prices with precision, we do expect prices to increase in 2003. In general, we change the prices that we charge our customers for our products on a monthly basis, as the costs of our raw materials fluctuate. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, and in some cases we are contractually or competitively restrained with respect to the means and timing of implementing price changes. Also, at some point price increases do erode our volumes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margins tend to fluctuate with the price of our raw materials. TAX RATE Our 2002 tax rate was approximately 36.4%. However, we believe that our effective tax rate will be approximately 38% for the next several years. Our 2002 tax rate was favorably impacted by the settlement of a contested income tax issue. See " Risk Factors" for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. RISK FACTORS This report contains statements about our future that are not statements of historical fact. Most of these statements are found in this report under the following subheadings: "Part I Item 1. Business," "Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our businesses are subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. Our failure to successfully compete against our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our competitors, especially those with nationally branded products that compete with our nationally branded products, have significantly greater resources than we do. Also, in many cases, those nationally branded products have significantly more name recognition and longer histories of success. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is especially important to the growth of our Dairy Group, as demand tends to be relatively flat in the dairy industry. Many of our Dairy Group retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current economic environment and we have recently been subject to a number of intensely competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group. The current competitive environment could result in margin erosion in our 35 Dairy Group, or the loss of certain customers altogether. In 2002, we lost several key local and regional grocery customers as a result of pricing battles with our competitors. Loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have long term contracts with many of our largest customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could be adversely affected if any one or more of our existing customers were to decide to establish captive dairy operations, or be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR BRANDING EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources toward the growth of our branded, value added portfolio of products, particularly at our Morningstar/White Wave segment. We believe that sales of these products could be a significant source of growth for our business. However, the success of our efforts will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our branded products, of which there can be no assurance. If our efforts do not succeed, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk and bulk cream, and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand, and, in some cases, governmental regulation. Weather affects the available supply of raw milk and cream. Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. Our White Wave operating unit is also sensitive to adverse weather due to its reliance on soybeans. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. Although we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs, we do expect raw material prices to increase in 2003. Because our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to customers through its "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of fuel. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. We are also a significant consumer of electricity, so any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources" beginning on page 31. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. 36 Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements), we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies. LOSS OF RIGHTS TO ANY OF OUR LICENSED BRANDS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Hersheys(R), Borden(R), Pet(R), Folgers(R), Land O Lakes(R) and others. In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. NEGATIVE HEALTH CLAIMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US As a manufacturer of food products, positive or negative publicity or medical research regarding the health effects of the types of foods that we produce affects us. For example, recent incidences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("BSE" or "mad cow disease") in other countries have raised public concern about the safety of eating beef and using or ingesting certain other animal derived products. The World Health Organization, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture have all affirmed that BSE is not transmitted to milk. However, we are still subject to risk as a result of public perception that milk products may be affected by mad cow disease. To date, we have not seen any measurable impact on our milk sales resulting from concerns about mad cow disease. However, should public concerns about the safety of milk or milk products escalate as a result of further occurrences of mad cow disease or for any other reason, we could suffer a loss of sales, which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial results. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS We sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as: product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, and other adulteration of food products. Consumption of an adulterated, contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury. We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury, and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or that exceed our insurance coverages. Although we maintain quality control programs designed to address food quality and safety issues, an actual or alleged problem with the quality, safety or integrity of our products at any of our facilities could result in: product withdrawals, product recalls, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 37 LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO ATTRACT KEY PERSONNEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS Our success depends to a large extent on the skills, experience and performance of our key personnel. The loss of one or more of these persons could hurt our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers, directors or other employees. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business will be adversely affected. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BYLAWS AND DELAWARE LAW COULD DETER TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS Some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, prevent or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or change of control. Our stockholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in series with the terms of each series to be fixed by our board of directors, divide our board of directors into three classes so that only approximately one third of the total number of directors is elected each year, permit directors to be removed only for cause, and specify advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, with certain exceptions, the Delaware General Corporation Law restricts mergers and other business combinations between us and any stockholder that acquires 15% or more of our voting stock. We also have a stockholder rights plan. Under this plan, after the occurrence of specified events, our stockholders will be able to buy stock from us or our successor at reduced prices. These rights do not extend, however, to persons participating in takeover attempts without the consent of our board of directors. Accordingly, this plan could delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a change of control. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2002: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS (IN MILLIONS) 6.23%................................................ June 2003 $ 50 4.29% to 4.69%....................................... December 2003 275 4.01% to 6.69%....................................... December 2004 275 5.20% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 400 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75 38 The following table summarizes our various interest rate agreements as of December 31, 2001: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS (IN MILLIONS) 4.90% to 4.93%....................................... December 2002 $275 6.07% to 6.24%....................................... December 2002 325 6.23%................................................ June 2003 50 6.69%................................................ December 2004 100 6.69% to 6.74%....................................... December 2005 100 6.78%................................................ December 2006 75 In January 2003, we entered into forward starting swaps that begin in March 2003 with a notional amount of $400 million. These swaps all expire in December 2003 and the fixed interest rates range between 1.47% to 1.48%. These swaps have been designated as hedges against interest rate exposure on loans under our senior credit facility. We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges for loans under Leche Celtas term loan. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes these agreements as of December 31, 2002 and 2001: FIXED INTEREST RATES EXPIRATION DATE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS 5.54% November 2003 9 million euros (approximately $9.4 million as of December 31, 2002 and $8.0 million as of December 31, 2001) 5.60% November 2004 12 million euros (approximately $12.6 million as of December 31, 2002 and $10.7 million as of December 31, 2001) We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $24 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2002 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. FOREIGN CURRENCY We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the euro. At this time, we believe that potential losses due to foreign currency fluctuations would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 39

In some cases, you can identify these statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "could," "expects," "seek to," "anticipates," "plans," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions, and in evaluating those statements, you should carefully consider the risks outlined below. Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROSPECTS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS Our businesses are subject to significant competition based on a number of factors. Our failure to successfully compete against our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our competitors, especially those with nationally branded products that compete with our nationally branded products, have significantly greater resources than we do. Also, in many cases, those nationally branded products have significantly more name recognition and longer histories of success. The consolidation trend is continuing in the retail grocery and foodservice industries. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. As the consolidation continues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or to gain new customers. Winning new customers is especially important to the growth of our Dairy Group, as demand tends to be relatively flat in the dairy industry. Many of our Dairy Group retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current economic environment and we have recently been subject to a number of intensely competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group. The current competitive environment could result in margin erosion in our 35 Dairy Group, or the loss of certain customers altogether. In 2002, we lost several key local and regional grocery customers as a result of pricing battles with our competitors. Loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have long term contracts with many of our largest customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could be adversely affected if any one or more of our existing customers were to decide to establish captive dairy operations, or be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. We could also be adversely affected by any expansion of capacity by our existing competitors or by new entrants in our markets. OUR BRANDING EFFORTS MAY NOT SUCCEED We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources toward the growth of our branded, value added portfolio of products, particularly at our Morningstar/White Wave segment. We believe that sales of these products could be a significant source of growth for our business. However, the success of our efforts will depend on customer and consumer acceptance of our branded products, of which there can be no assurance. If our efforts do not succeed, we may not be able to continue to significantly increase sales or profit margins. CHANGES IN RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER INPUT COSTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT US The most important raw materials that we use in our operations are raw milk and bulk cream, and high density polyethylene resin. The prices of these materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand, and, in some cases, governmental regulation. Weather affects the available supply of raw milk and cream. Our Specialty Foods segment purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers located near our plants. Bad weather in one of the growing areas can damage or destroy the crop in that area. If we are not able to buy cucumbers from one of our local growers due to bad weather, we are forced to purchase cucumbers from non local sources at substantially higher prices, which can have an adverse affect on Specialty Foods results of operations. Our White Wave operating unit is also sensitive to adverse weather due to its reliance on soybeans. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Extremely high raw material costs can also put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. Although we cannot predict future changes in raw material costs, we do expect raw material prices to increase in 2003. Because our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to customers through its "direct store delivery" system, we are a large consumer of fuel. Increases in fuel prices can adversely affect our results of operations. We are also a significant consumer of electricity, so any significant increase in energy prices could adversely affect our financial performance. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEBT AND OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND WE MAY INCUR EVEN MORE DEBT We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See " Liquidity and Capital Resources" beginning on page 31. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. 36 Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our financial results.

Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies.

In some cases, we have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands.
