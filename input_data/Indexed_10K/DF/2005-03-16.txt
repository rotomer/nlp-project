Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 2 Table of Contents and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs. Other raw materials used by the Dairy Group, such as juice concentrates and sweeteners, in addition to packaging supplies, are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of our Dairy Groups raw materials and packaging supplies are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of our raw materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand. The Dairy Group generally increases or decreases the prices of its fluid dairy products on a monthly basis in correlation to fluctuations in the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies. However, in some cases, we are competitively or contractually constrained with respect to the means and or timing of price increases, especially in the event of rapidly increasing raw milk prices. This can have a negative impact on the Dairy Groups profitability. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. Since 1990, the dairy industry has experienced significant consolidation led in part by us. Consolidation has tended to lower costs and raise efficiency. However, per capita consumption of traditional fluid dairy products has continued to decline. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 10% from 1990 to the end of 2003, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic, and due to the significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. For more financial information about our Dairy Groups recent operations, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. WhiteWave Foods Company WhiteWave Foods Companys operations have historically been conducted through three distinct operating units: White Wave, Inc. (White Wave), Horizon Organic and Dean National Brand Group. We are currently in the process of consolidating these three operating units and expect the consolidation to be completed in 2006. WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy products, juices and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; and LAND OLAKES creamers and cultured products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells Sun Soy soymilk; The Organic Cow of Vermont organic dairy products; White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu; Hersheys milks and milkshakes; Maries dips and dressings; and Naturally Yours sour cream. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. Other branded products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company include Mocha Mix non dairy liquid coffee creamer and Second Nature egg substitute. In connection with our planned spin off of our Specialty 3 Table of Contents Foods Group segment in the third quarter of 2005, we intend to transfer the Mocha Mix and Second Nature businesses to our Specialty Foods Group segment, effective as of the time of the spin off. Finally, a small portion (approximately 3% in 2004) of WhiteWave Foods Companys sales is private label soymilk and organic dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Companys sales totaled approximately $1.19 billion in 2004, or approximately 11% of our consolidated sales. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. In 2004, approximately 84% of WhiteWave Foods Companys sales were to retailers and approximately 8% were to foodservice outlets. WhiteWave Foods Companys customer base is diverse, with no single customer representing more than 10% of sales in 2004. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products are sold pursuant to customer purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. In 2004, approximately 64% of the products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company were manufactured by our Dairy Group. An additional 32% were manufactured by third party manufacturers under processing agreements. WhiteWave Foods Company currently owns two manufacturing facilities, one of which produces all of its tofu products and the other, purchased in April 2004, produces a portion of its Silk soymilk. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products are delivered by common carrier to customer warehouses, although some products are distributed through third party distributors or through our Dairy Groups DSD system. The primary raw materials used in our soy based products are organic soybeans and organic soybean concentrate. Organic soybeans are generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these products. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs in 2005. Generally, these agreements provide pricing at fixed levels. The primary raw material used in our organic milk based products is organic raw milk. Organic raw milk supplies are constrained and the growth of our organic dairy business depends on us being able to procure sufficient quantities of organic raw milk in time to meet our needs. We currently purchase organic raw milk from a network of approximately 300 dairy farmers across the United States. We generally enter into supply agreements with dairy farmers, with typical terms of one to two years, which obligate us to purchase certain minimum quantities. We also produce certain of our own organic raw milk needs in the U.S. at two organic farms that we own and operate. We believe, based on currently projected sales levels, that we have secured a sufficient supply of raw organic milk to meet our needs for the remainder of 2005. The primary raw material used in our LAND OLAKES and other non organic dairy products is raw milk. We purchase raw milk from farmers cooperatives, typically pursuant to requirements contracts (with no minimum purchase obligation). Raw milk is generally readily available. The minimum price of raw milk is regulated in most parts of the country by the federal government. Several states also regulate raw milk pricing through their own programs. Other raw materials used in WhiteWave Foods Companys products, such as flavorings, organic sugar and packaging materials, are generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of these raw materials are purchased under contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of raw materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand. For more information, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many different factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and 4 Table of Contents organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. For more information about our WhiteWave Foods Company, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Specialty Foods Group Our Specialty Foods Group is the nations leading private label pickle processor, and the largest manufacturer and seller of private label non dairy powdered creamer in the United States. The Specialty Foods Group also manufactures and sells a variety of other foods, such as aseptic sauces and puddings. In January 2005, we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group to our shareholders. See Developments Since January 1, 2004 Tax Free Spin Off of Specialty Foods Group. The Specialty Foods Groups sales totaled $676.8 million in 2004, or approximately 6% of our consolidated sales. The following charts graphically depict the Specialty Foods Groups 2004 sales by product category and channel, and indicate the percentage of private label sales versus company branded sales in 2004. (1) Approximately 75% of the Specialty Foods Groups pickle, relish and pepper products are sold under private labels, with the remaining 25% sold under our proprietary brands including Farmans, Nalleys, Peter Piper and Steinfeld. Branded pickle products are sold to retailers. Private label products are sold to retailers, foodservice customers and in bulk to other food processors. (2) Non dairy powdered creamer is used as a coffee creamer and as an ingredient in baking, beverage mixes, gravies and sauces. In 2004, Specialty Foods Group sold 14% of its non dairy powdered creamer under our Cremora brand, while the rest of the Specialty Foods Groups creamer products were sold under private labels to retailers, distributors and in bulk to other food companies for use as ingredients in their products. (3) Aseptic products are sterilized, which allows storage for prolonged periods without refrigeration. Our Specialty Foods Group manufactures aseptic cheese sauces and puddings. Our cheese sauces and puddings are sold primarily under private labels to distributors. In 2004, our Specialty Foods Group also sold aseptic nutritional beverages in the meal supplement, weight loss/gain and sports categories, all of which were sold under customer brands to retailers and distributors. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we exited the nutritional beverage business due largely to significant declines in volume. (4) Includes shrimp, seafood, tartar, horseradish, chili, sweet and sour sauces and syrups sold to retail grocers in the eastern, midwestern and southern United States. These products are sold under the Bennetts, Hoffman House and RoddenberryNorthwoods brand names. 5 Table of Contents (5) Includes mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores and grocery stores. The Specialty Foods Groups largest customer is Wal Mart (including its subsidiaries, such as Sams Club) which accounted for 10.1% of the Specialty Foods Groups 2004 sales. The Specialty Foods Groups products are delivered to customers stores and warehouses primarily by common carrier. The Specialty Foods Group sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the Specialty Foods Groups customers purchase products from the Specialty Foods Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. Our Specialty Foods Group uses a wide variety of raw materials. The main raw material used by the Specialty Foods Group is cucumbers. The Specialty Foods Group purchases cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers. We supply seeds and advise growers regarding planting techniques. We also monitor and arrange proper agricultural practices. Other raw materials used by the Specialty Foods Group, such as corn syrup, soy bean oil and casein, in addition to packaging materials, are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of the Specialty Foods Groups raw materials and packaging supplies are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of the Specialty Foods Groups raw materials increase or decrease based on supply and demand. The Specialty Foods Group produces its products in 10 facilities located across the United States. For more information about the Specialty Foods Groups manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. The Specialty Foods Group has several competitors in each of its product markets. In sales of private label products, the principal competitive factors are price relative to other private label suppliers, product quality and quality of service. For the Specialty Foods Groups branded products, competition to obtain shelf space with retailers is based on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. In certain cases, the Specialty Foods Group pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular company branded product. Competition for consumer sales is based on brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. International Group Our International Group manufactures, markets and sells private label and branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. The International Groups sales totaled $310.7 million in 2004, or approximately 3% of our consolidated sales. The following charts graphically depict the International Groups 2004 sales by product category and channel, and indicate the percentage of private label sales versus company branded sales in 2004. (1) All of our International Groups fluid dairy products are pasteurized at ultra high temperatures (UHT). 6 Table of Contents (2) Our International Groups largest customers in 2004 were Carrefour, S.A., Lidl Supermercados S.A., and Eroski Sociedad Cooperativa, which accounted for approximately 25.2%, 11.2% and 10.8% of the International Groups 2004 sales, respectively. (3) Including our proprietary Celta, Campobueno, Milsani and La Vaquera brands. Our International Group manufactures its products in five facilities in Spain and Portugal. For more information about our International Group facilities, see Item 2. Properties. In the fourth quarter of 2004 we completed construction of a new facility, located in Alpiarca, Portugal, which commenced production in December 2004. Our International Group operates its business primarily from its headquarters located in Pontedeume, Galicia, Spain. The long shelf life of our International Groups UHT fluid milk products allows delivery by common carrier. Most of the International Groups customers purchase our products either by purchase order or by contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. Our International Groups sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be lower in the third quarter. The primary raw material used by our International Group is raw milk. We purchase our raw milk from farmers cooperatives and other intermediaries pursuant to formal and informal contractual arrangements. Raw milk production volume is regulated by European Union quotas, which sometimes limit the availability of raw milk to processors. The price of raw milk is defined solely by supply and demand and can fluctuate widely. Our International Group purchases its packaging materials from two leading suppliers. Packaging materials represent a significant portion of our International Groups raw material costs and are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The Iberian fluid dairy market, which includes Spain and Portugal, is characterized by relatively high per capita consumption and the UHT brick pack format dominates the industry. The combination of these factors makes the Iberian region one of the largest UHT markets in the world. The Iberian fluid dairy market has been characterized over the past 20 years by slow growth in the core products and faster growth for value added products such as nutritionally enriched milks. The Iberian fluid dairy industry is highly competitive, with leading companies investing heavily in innovation and branding. The industry has undergone significant consolidation in the past 5 to 10 years leading to the emergence of several national brands, including our Celta brand. Our International Group competes with all the leading fluid dairy processors operating in the Iberian region. Competition between dairy processors for private label business has intensified recently as a result of retailer consolidation, and is based primarily on price, service and quality. Competition for branded sales to consumers is based on a number of factors, including brand recognition, price and quality. Effective January 1, 2005, our Rachels Organic Dairy business, which has historically been a part of Horizon Organics operations, was transferred to the International Group. Rachels Organic Dairy, which markets and sells organic dairy products across the United Kingdom, has one facility located in Aberystwth, Wales. The preceding discussion excludes Rachels Organic Dairy. Current Business Strategy Maximize Dairy Group Performance As the largest dairy processor in the United States, our Dairy Group is in a unique position to provide unmatched service, convenience and value to our customers. We are intently focused on maintaining and extending our Dairy Groups leadership position by focusing on our customers needs. In 2004, our Dairy Group was successful in maintaining its sales volume despite extremely volatile raw milk prices and declining overall demand for dairy products in the United States, which we believe indicates that we are gaining market share. However, Dairy Group profitability suffered in 2004 due to an extremely competitive retail environment and a difficult raw material environment, as well as unusually high fuel and energy costs. We closed eight Dairy Group facilities in 2004 in an effort to reduce our cost structure. In 2005, we are focused on maintaining and growing our Dairy Groups sales volume by continuing to provide our customers with the highest level of service, quality and value, while at the same time further reducing our cost 7 Table of Contents structure through rationalization of manufacturing and distribution networks and more efficient utilization of technology and other efficiency initiatives. Consolidate and Reorganize WhiteWave Foods Company In the third quarter of 2004, we announced our intention to consolidate the three businesses included within our WhiteWave Foods Company segment (formerly the Branded Products Group segment) into a single operating unit. We believe this consolidation will allow us to interact with customers more efficiently and effectively as a single sales and marketing organization, and will enable us to create a simplified and more efficient supply chain for our branded business. We have completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization for the three companies, and in the third quarter of 2005, the employees of the new company will move to a new headquarters located in Broomfield, Colorado. The full integration of these businesses will be a lengthy process involving all aspects of the three companies operations, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and administration, and will include the selection and implementation of a new information technology platform. As part of our overall reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company into a unified branded consumer packaged goods company, we also intend to bring in house certain manufacturing activities that are currently being done by third parties. We expect the consolidation to be completed within the next 12 to 18 months. One of our primary strategic objectives in 2005 is the successful continuation of the consolidation and reorganization process. In addition, effective March 11, 2005, Mr. Steve Demos, President of WhiteWave Foods Company resigned his position. We have retained a leading executive recruiting firm to assist in the search for a new president. Mr. Gregg Engles, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, has assumed direct leadership of WhiteWave Foods Company on an interim basis. Invest in the Growth and Profitability of our Brands In 2005, we intend to continue to invest in aggressively marketing our WhiteWave Foods Company brands, with an emphasis on our largest and most successful brands: Silk, Horizon Organic, International Delight and LAND OLAKES. Further, we will continue to make capital expenditures allowing us to increase internal manufacturing, which we believe will allow us to better manage our working capital and increase profitability. Developments Since January 1, 2004 Reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company In the third quarter of 2004, we announced our intent to consolidate the three businesses included within WhiteWave Foods Company. See Current Business Strategy above. Tax Free Spin Off of Specialty Foods Group On January 27, 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group. The spin off will create a publicly traded food manufacturing company serving the retail grocery and foodservice markets with approximately 1,800 employees and estimated 2005 net sales of over $700 million. Also effective January 27, 2005, we hired a new management team, headed by Sam Reed, former CEO of Keebler Foods Company, to lead the new company. In conjunction with their employment, the management team made a cash investment of $10 million in the Specialty Foods Group, representing 1.7% ownership of the new business. As part of the spin off, we intend to transfer our Mocha Mix non dairy creamer, Second Nature egg substitute and foodservice salad dressings businesses to the Specialty Foods Group from WhiteWave Foods Company and our Dairy Group. The spin off is intended to take the form of a tax free distribution to our shareholders of a new publicly traded stock, which we expect to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We expect the spin off to be completed in the third quarter of 2005, subject to confirmation by the Internal Revenue Service of the tax free nature of the transaction, registration of the new security with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other customary closing conditions. 8 Table of Contents Acquisitions Milk Products of Alabama On October 15, 2004 our Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama, a dairy manufacturer based in Decatur, Alabama. Milk Products of Alabama had net sales of approximately $34 million in 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we have expanded our production capabilities in the southeastern United States, allowing us to better serve our customers. Milk Products of Alabamas results of operations are now included in the Morningstar division of our Dairy Group. We paid approximately $23.2 million for the purchase of Milk Products of Alabama, including costs of acquisition, and funded the purchase price with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Tiger Foods On May 31, 2004, Leche Celta, our Spanish subsidiary, acquired Tiger Foods, a dairy processing business with one facility located in Avila, Spain. Tiger Foods, which had net sales of approximately $29 million in 2003, manufactures and distributes branded and private label UHT milk and dairy based drinks throughout Spain, with an emphasis in the southern and central regions. Tiger Foods operations complement our Spanish operations and we expect this acquisition to allow us to reduce our transportation costs for raw milk and finished products due to the new facilitys geographic proximity to our raw milk suppliers and certain customers. We paid approximately $21.9 million for the purchase of the company, all of which was funded with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Soy Processing Facility On April 5, 2004, WhiteWave Foods Company acquired a soy processing and packaging facility located in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Prior to the acquisition, the previous owner of the facility co packed Silk products for us at the facility. As a result of the acquisition, we have increased our in house processing and packaging capabilities for our soy products, resulting in cost reductions. We paid approximately $25.7 million for the purchase of the facility, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility. LAND OLAKES East In 2002, we purchased a perpetual license to use the LAND OLAKES brand on certain dairy products nationally, excluding cheese and butter. This perpetual license was subject, however, to a pre existing sublicense entitling a competitor to manufacture and sell cream, sour cream and whipping cream in certain channels in the eastern United States. Effective March 31, 2004, we acquired that sublicense and certain customer relationships of the sublicensee (LAND OLAKES East) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17 million, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility. We now have the exclusive right to use the LAND OLAKES brand on certain dairy products (other than cheese and butter) throughout the entire United States. Ross Swiss Dairies On January 26, 2004, our Dairy Group acquired Ross Swiss Dairies, a dairy distributor based in Los Angeles, California, which had net sales of approximately $120 million in 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we have increased the distribution capability of our Dairy Group in southern California, allowing us to better serve our customers. Ross Swiss Dairies historically purchased a significant portion of its products from other processors. Now the majority of products distributed by Ross Swiss Dairies are manufactured in our southern California facilities. We paid approximately $21.8 million, including transaction costs, for the purchase of Ross Swiss Dairies and funded the purchase price with borrowings under our receivables backed facility. Horizon Organic On January 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 87% of Horizon Organic Holding Corporation (Horizon Organic) that we did not already own. Horizon Organic had sales of over $200 million during 9 Table of Contents 2003. We already owned approximately 13% of the outstanding common stock of Horizon Organic as a result of investments made in 1998. Third party co packers, including us, have historically done all of Horizon Organics manufacturing. During 2003, we produced approximately 27% of Horizon Organics fluid dairy products. We also distributed Horizon Organics products in several parts of the country. Horizon Organic is a leading branded organic foods company in the United States. Because organic foods are gaining popularity with consumers and because Horizon Organics products offer consumers an alternative to our Dairy Groups traditional dairy products, we believe Horizon Organic is an important addition to our portfolio of brands. The aggregate purchase price for the 87% of Horizon Organic that we did not already own was approximately $287 million, including approximately $217 million of cash paid to Horizon Organics stockholders, the repayment of approximately $40 million of borrowings under Horizon Organics former credit facility, and transaction expenses of approximately $9 million, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility and our receivables backed facility. In addition, each of the options to purchase Horizon Organics common stock outstanding on January 2, 2004 was converted into an option to purchase .7301 shares of our stock, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $21 million. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, Horizon Organics financial results are reported as part of our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our acquisitions. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities As part of our continued reorganization and cost reduction efforts in our Dairy Group, we closed eight Dairy Group facilities in 2004. The closed facilities were located in Lansing, Michigan; Wilkesboro, North Carolina; Madison, Wisconsin; Sulphur Springs, Texas; San Leandro and South Gate, California; Westwego, Louisiana and Pocatello, Idaho. On September 7, 2004, we announced our plan to exit the nutritional beverages business operated by our Specialty Foods Group segment, including the closure of a manufacturing facility in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In 2004, we experienced significant declines in volume on this product line and we believed those volumes could not be replaced without a significant investment in capital and research and development. We ceased nutritional beverages production in December 2004. We recorded a total of approximately $34.7 million in facility closing and reorganization costs during 2004. We expect to incur additional charges related to these restructuring plans of approximately $7.1 million, primarily in 2005. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities, including termination of certain contractual agreements; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our facility closing and reorganization activities. 10 Table of Contents Construction of New Facilities During 2004, our Dairy Group completed construction of a new dairy manufacturing and distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. This facility commenced operations in the third quarter of 2004 and allows us to better serve the southern Nevada, Arizona, and southern Colorado markets. In addition, Leche Celta finished construction of our first dairy manufacturing facility in Portugal in the fourth quarter of 2004. The new facility is located in Alpiarca, Portugal and commenced production in December 2004. The new facility allows us to expand our Iberian operations. Stock Buyback During 2004, we spent approximately $297 million, including commissions and fees, to repurchase 9.3 million shares of our common stock for an average purchase price of $31.90 per share. At March 11, 2005, approximately $118 million remained available under our current authorization. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part II Item 5. Market for Our Common Stock and Related Matters. Amendment to Credit Facility In August 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to (1) increase the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, (2) increase the size of our term loan A from $850 million to $1.5 billion, (3) eliminate term loans B and C and (4) modify the interest rate and payment terms. When we amended our credit facility, we were required to write off approximately $32.6 million of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with our credit facility prior to the amendment. These costs were being amortized over the previous terms of the revolving credit facility and term loans. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Employees As of December 31, 2004 we had the following employees: No. of % of Employees Total Dairy Group 25,730 89.9 % WhiteWave Foods Company 570 2.0 Specialty Foods Group 1,700 5.9 International Group 450 1.6 Corporate 160 0.6 Total 28,610 100.0 % Approximately 38% of the Dairy Groups employees and approximately 54% of the Specialty Foods Groups employees participate in collective bargaining agreements. Government Regulation Public Health As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations, 11 Table of Contents specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorize regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe that our facilities and manufacturing practices comply with all material government regulations. Employee Safety Regulations We are subject to certain safety regulations including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations. Environmental Regulations We are subject to various environmental regulations. Ammonia, a refrigerant used extensively in our operations, is considered an extremely hazardous substance pursuant to U.S. federal environmental laws due to its toxicity. Also, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels permitted under local regulations. Because of this, certain of our subsidiaries are required to pay wastewater surcharges or to construct wastewater pretreatment facilities. To date, such wastewater surcharges have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain above ground or underground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. These tanks are periodically inspected to determine compliance with applicable regulations. We are required to make expenditures from time to time in order to maintain compliance of these tanks. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not expect environmental compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. Milk Industry Regulation The federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in federally regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk contains primarily raw skim milk, in addition to a small percentage of butterfat. The federal government establishes separate minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested to determine the percentage of butterfat, and we pay our suppliers separate prices for the raw skim milk and butterfat based on the results of these tests. The federal governments minimum prices are calculated by economic formula based on supply and demand and vary depending on the processors geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured using the raw product. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for butterfat and raw skim milk that is processed into milk) and Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw skim milk that is processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams, creamers, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government by the 23rd day of the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices for each month are announced on or before the fifth day after the end of that month. 12 Table of Contents Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. A few states also have retail pricing requirements. In Spain, the government has established a quota system regulating the amount of milk that can be sold by individual farmers and farm cooperatives, which affects the prices we pay for raw milk. Brief History We commenced operations in 1988 through a predecessor entity. Our original operations consisted solely of a packaged ice business. Since then the following activity has occurred: December 1993 Acquired Suiza Dairy Corporation, a regional dairy processor located in Puerto Rico. We then began acquiring other local and regional U.S. dairy processors, growing our dairy business rapidly primarily through acquisitions. April 1996 Completed our initial public offering under our former name Suiza Foods Corporation and began trading on Nasdaq National Market. January 1997 Completed a secondary offering. March 1997 Began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. August 1997 Acquired Franklin Plastics, Inc., a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling plastic containers. After the acquisition, we began acquiring other companies in the plastic packaging industry. November 1997 Acquired Morningstar Foods Inc., whose business was the predecessor to our WhiteWave Foods Company. This was our first acquisition of a company with national brands.

(2) Net sales have been restated to reflect the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01 09 Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer. The net effect was to decrease net sales by $33.7 million and $29.9 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. There was no impact on our net income as a result of the adoption of this issue. (3) On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires, among other things, that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized and that recognized intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective useful lives. As required by SFAS No. 142, our results for periods prior to 2002 have not been restated. (4) Results for 2004 include a gain of $5.9 million primarily related to the settlement of litigation. Results for 2003 include a gain of $66.2 million on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations and a gain of $2.5 million related to the divestiture of 11 facilities in 2001. Results for 2001 include a gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of 11 facilities offset by an expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to a supplier as consideration for modifications to an agreement and an impairment charge of $1.7 million on a water plant. Results in 2000 include litigation settlement costs of $7.5 million. (5) Results for 2004 include a charge of $32.6 million to write off deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility. Results for 2001 and 2000 have been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections. Gains and losses that were previously recorded as extraordinary items related to the early extinguishment of debt, which were a $7.3 million loss in 2001 and a $7.7 million gain in 2000, have been reclassified to interest expense. There was no effect on net income. (6) In December 2001, in connection with our acquisition of the former Dean Foods Company (Legacy Dean), we purchased Dairy Farmers of Americas 33.8% interest in our Dairy Group. (7) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, earnings represents income before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest on all debt, amortization of deferred financing costs and the portion of rental expense that we believe is representative of the interest component of rent expense. (8) Includes amounts outstanding under subsidiary lines of credit and the current portion of long term debt. 22 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview We are a leading food and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the United States. The Dairy Group manufactures and sells its products under a variety of local and regional brand names and under customer private labels. Our WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, markets and sells a variety of well known soy, dairy and dairy related nationally branded products including, for example: Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy products, juices and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; Maries refrigerated dips and dressings; and LAND O LAKES fluid dairy and cultured products. Our Specialty Foods Group is the leading private label pickle processor in the United States and a maker of a variety of other food products. In January 2005, we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. See Developments Since January 1, 2004 Tax Free Spin Off of Specialty Foods Group. We also own the fourth largest dairy processor in Spain. Dairy Group Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment, with approximately 80% of our consolidated sales in 2004. Our Dairy Group manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream, cultured dairy products and juices to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across the United States. The Dairy Group also manufactures a portion of the products marketed and sold by WhiteWave Foods Company. Due to the perishable nature of the Dairy Groups products, our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to its customers stores in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a direct store delivery or DSD system and we believe we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by the Dairy Groups corporate sales department. Most of the Dairy Groups customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The Dairy Groups sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be higher in the third and fourth quarters. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. Since 1990, the dairy industry has experienced significant consolidation led in part by us. Consolidation has tended to lower costs and raise efficiency. However, consumption of traditional fluid dairy products has continued to decline. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 10% from 1990 to the end of 2003, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume sales growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic, in addition to the significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation, and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. WhiteWave Foods Company The WhiteWave Foods Companys operations have historically been conducted through three distinct operating units: White Wave, Inc. (White Wave), Horizon Organic and Dean National Brand Group. We are currently in the process of consolidating these three operating units and 23 Table of Contents expect the consolidation to be completed in 2006. WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, develops, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy products, juices and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; and LAND OLAKES creamers and cultured products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells Sun Soy soymilk; The Organic Cow of Vermont organic dairy products; White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu; Hersheys milks and milkshakes; Maries dips and dressings; and Naturally Yours sour cream. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. In 2004, approximately 84% of WhiteWave Foods Companys sales were to retailers and approximately 8% were to foodservice outlets. WhiteWave Foods Companys customer base is diverse, with no single customer representing more than 10% of sales in 2004. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products are sold pursuant to customer purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many different factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Specialty Foods Group Our Specialty Foods Group is the nations leading private label pickle processor, and one of the largest manufacturers and sellers of non dairy powdered creamer in the United States. The Specialty Foods Group also manufactures and sells a variety of other foods, such as aseptic sauces and puddings. In January 2005 we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment. See Developments since January 1, 2004. The Specialty Foods Groups products are delivered to customers stores and warehouses primarily by common carrier. The Specialty Foods Group sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the Specialty Foods Groups customers purchase products from the Specialty Foods Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The Specialty Foods Group has several competitors in each of its product markets. In sales of private label products, the principal competitive factors are price relative to other private label suppliers, product quality and quality of service. For the Specialty Foods Groups branded products, competition to obtain shelf space with retailers is based on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. In certain cases, the Specialty Foods Group pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular company branded product. Competition for consumer sales is based on brand recognition, price, taste preferences, and quality. International Group Our International Group, which does not qualify as a reportable segment, manufactures, markets and sells private label and branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. Also, effective January 1, 2005, our Rachels Organic Dairy business, which has historically been part of Horizon Organics operations, was transferred to the International Group. 24 Table of Contents Developments Since January 1, 2004 Reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company In the third quarter of 2004, we announced our intention to consolidate the three businesses included within our WhiteWave Foods Company segment (formerly the Branded Products Group segment) into a single operating unit. We believe this consolidation will allow us to interact with customers more efficiently and effectively as a single sales and marketing organization, and will enable us to create a simplified and more efficient supply chain for our branded business. We have completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization for the three companies, and in the third quarter of 2005, the employees of the new company will move to a new headquarters located in Broomfield, Colorado. The full integration of these businesses will be a lengthy process involving all aspects of the three companies operations, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and administration, and will include the selection and implementation of a new information technology platform. As part of our overall reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company into a unified branded consumer packaged goods company, we also intend to bring in house certain manufacturing activities that are currently being done by third parties. In addition, effective March 11, 2005, Mr. Steve Demos, President of WhiteWave Foods Company resigned his position. We have retained a leading executive recruiting firm to assist in the search for a new president. Mr. Gregg Engles, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, has assumed direct leadership of WhiteWave Foods Company on an interim basis. Tax Free Spin Off of Specialty Foods Group On January 27, 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group. The spin off will create a publicly traded food manufacturing company serving the retail grocery and foodservice markets with approximately 1,800 employees and estimated 2005 net sales of over $700 million. Also effective January 27, 2005, we hired a management team, headed by Sam Reed, former CEO of Keebler Foods Company, to lead the new company. In conjunction with their employment, the management team made a cash investment of $10 million in the Specialty Foods Group, representing 1.7% ownership of the new business. As part of the spin off, we intend to transfer our Mocha Mix non dairy creamer, Second Nature egg substitute and foodservice salad dressings businesses to the Specialty Foods Group from WhiteWave Foods Company and our Dairy Group. The spin off is intended to take the form of a tax free distribution to our shareholders of a new publicly traded stock, which we expect to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We expect the spin off to be completed in the third quarter of 2005, subject to confirmation by the Internal Revenue Service of the tax free nature of the transaction, registration of the new security with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other customary closing conditions. Acquisitions Milk Products of Alabama On October 15, 2004, our Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama, a dairy manufacturer based in Decatur, Alabama. Milk Products of Alabama had net sales of approximately $34 million in 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we have expanded our production capabilities in the southeastern United States, allowing us to better serve our customers. Milk Products of Alabamas results of operations are now included in the Morningstar division of our Dairy Group. We paid approximately $23.2 million for the purchase of Milk Products of Alabama, including costs of acquisition, and funded the purchase price with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Tiger Foods On May 31, 2004, Leche Celta, our Spanish subsidiary, acquired Tiger Foods, a dairy processing business with one facility located in Avila, Spain. Tiger Foods, which had net sales of approximately $29 million in 25 Table of Contents 2003, manufactures and distributes branded and private label UHT milk and dairy based drinks throughout Spain, with an emphasis in the southern and central regions. Tiger Foods operations complement our Spanish operations and we expect this acquisition to allow us to reduce our transportation costs for raw milk and finished products due to the new facilitys geographic proximity to our raw milk suppliers and certain customers. We paid approximately $21.9 million for the purchase of the company, all of which was funded with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Soy Processing Facility On April 5, 2004, our WhiteWave Foods Company acquired a soy processing and packaging facility located in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Prior to the acquisition, the previous owner of the facility co packed Silk products for us at the facility. As a result of the acquisition, we have increased our in house processing and packaging capabilities for our soy products, resulting in cost reductions. We paid approximately $25.7 million for the purchase of the facility, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility. LAND OLAKES East In 2002, we purchased a perpetual license to use the LAND OLAKES brand on certain dairy products nationally, excluding cheese and butter. This perpetual license was subject, however, to a pre existing sublicense entitling a competitor to manufacture and sell cream, sour cream and whipping cream in certain channels in the eastern United States. Effective March 31, 2004, we acquired that sublicense and certain customer relationships of the sublicensee (LAND OLAKES East) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17 million, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility. We now have the exclusive right to use the LAND OLAKES brand on certain dairy products (other than cheese and butter) throughout the entire United States. Ross Swiss Dairies On January 26, 2004, our Dairy Group acquired Ross Swiss Dairies, a dairy distributor based in Los Angeles, California, which had net sales of approximately $120 million in 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we have increased the distribution capability of our Dairy Group in southern California, allowing us to better serve our customers. Ross Swiss Dairies has historically purchased a significant portion of its products from other processors. Now the majority of products distributed by Ross Swiss Dairies are manufactured in our southern California facilities. We paid approximately $21.8 million, including transaction costs, for the purchase of Ross Swiss Dairies and funded the purchase price with borrowings under our receivables backed facility. Horizon Organic On January 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 87% of Horizon Organic Holding Corporation (Horizon Organic) that we did not already own. Horizon Organic had sales of over $200 million during 2003. We already owned approximately 13% of the outstanding common stock of Horizon Organic as a result of investments made in 1998. Third party co packers, including us, have historically done all of Horizon Organics manufacturing. During 2003, we produced approximately 27% of Horizon Organics fluid dairy products. We also distributed Horizon Organics products in several parts of the country. Horizon Organic is a leading branded organic foods company in the United States. Because organic foods are gaining popularity with consumers and because Horizon Organics products offer consumers an alternative to our Dairy Groups traditional dairy products, we believe Horizon Organic is an important addition to our portfolio of brands. The aggregate purchase price for the 87% of Horizon Organic that we did not already own was approximately $287 million, including approximately $217 million of cash paid to Horizon Organics stockholders, the repayment of approximately $40 million of borrowings under Horizon Organics former credit facility, and transaction expenses of approximately $9 million, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility and our receivables backed facility. In addition, each of the options to purchase Horizon Organics common stock outstanding on January 2, 2004 was converted into an option to purchase 26 Table of Contents ..7301 shares of our stock, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $21 million. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, Horizon Organics financial results are reported in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our acquisitions. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities As part of our continued reorganization and cost reduction efforts in our Dairy Group, we closed eight Dairy Group facilities in 2004. The closed facilities were located in Lansing, Michigan; Wilkesboro, North Carolina; Madison, Wisconsin; Sulphur Springs, Texas; San Leandro and South Gate, California; Westwego, Louisiana and Pocatello, Idaho. On September 7, 2004, we announced our plan to exit the nutritional beverages business operated by our Specialty Foods Group segment, including the closure of a manufacturing facility in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In 2004, we experienced significant declines in volume on this product line and we believed those volumes could not be replaced without a significant investment in capital and research and development. We ceased nutritional beverages production in December 2004. We recorded a total of approximately $34.7 million in facility closing and reorganization costs during 2004. We expect to incur additional charges related to these restructuring plans of approximately $7.1 million, primarily in 2005. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities, including termination of certain contractual agreements; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our facility closing and reorganization activities. Construction of New Facilities During 2004, our Dairy Group completed construction of a new dairy manufacturing and distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. This facility commenced operations in the third quarter of 2004 and allows us to better serve the southern Nevada, Arizona and southern Colorado markets. In addition, Leche Celta finished construction of our first dairy manufacturing facility in Portugal in the fourth quarter of 2004. The new facility is located in Alpiarca, Portugal and commenced production in December 2004. The new facility allows us to expand our Iberian operations. Stock Buyback During 2004, we spent approximately $297 million, including commissions and fees, to repurchase 9.3 million shares of our common stock for an average purchase price of $31.90 per share. At March 11, 2005, approximately $118 million remained available under our current authorization. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Table of Contents Amendment to Credit Facility In August 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to (1) increase the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, (2) increase the size of our term loan A from $850 million to $1.5 billion, (3) eliminate term loans B and C and (4) modify the interest rate and payment terms. When we amended our credit facility, we were required to write off approximately $32.6 million of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with our credit facility prior to the amendment. These costs were being amortized over the previous terms of the revolving credit facility and term loans. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table presents certain information concerning our financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales.

Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales $ Increase/ % Increase/ 2004 2003 (Decrease) (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 8,646.4 $ 7,542.1 $ 1,104.3 14.6 % WhiteWave Foods Company 1,188.4 713.4 475.0 66.6 Specialty Foods Group 676.8 684.2 (7.4 ) (1.1 ) Corporate/ Other 310.7 244.9 65.8 26.9 Total $ 10,822.3 $ 9,184.6 $ 1,637.7 17.8 % 28 Table of Contents The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2004 vs. 2003 Pricing, Volume Total Foreign and Product Increase/ Acquisitions Divestitures Exchange Mix Changes (Decrease) (In millions) Dairy Group $ 386.2 $ (26.2 ) $ $ 744.3 $ 1,104.3 WhiteWave Foods Company 282.8 (4.0 ) 196.2 475.0 Specialty Foods Group 6.7 (14.1 ) (7.4 ) Corporate/ Other 18.0 28.1 19.7 65.8 Total $ 693.7 $ (30.2 ) $ 28.1 $ 946.1 $ 1,637.7 Net sales increased approximately $1.64 billion during 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher selling prices resulting from the pass through of increased raw milk costs and due to acquisitions. We acquired Kohler Mix Specialties, Melody Farms and Ross Swiss Dairies in our Dairy Group segment; Horizon Organic and LAND OLAKES East in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment; Cremora in our Specialty Foods Group segment; and Tiger Foods in our Corporate/ Other segment. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers; and costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Our cost of sales ratio increased to 76.3% in 2004 compared to 74.1% in 2003 due almost entirely to increased raw material costs that affected all of our segments in 2004. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $287.2 million, or approximately 17.8%, during 2004 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Acquisitions, which we estimate represented approximately $118 million of the increase. A $62.8 million decline in other operating income compared to last year primarily due to a $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business that reduced operating expenses in 2003. Higher fuel costs across all segments and increased volumes at the WhiteWave Foods Company, which we estimate added a combined total of approximately $29 million to distribution costs for 2004 as compared to last year. Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $22.9 million higher than 2003. Corporate expenses that were approximately $10 million higher than last year, including higher professional fees and legal fees primarily related to the reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company, increased transactional activity and higher regulatory compliance fees. Our operating expense ratio was consistent at 17.5% for 2004 as compared to 17.6% for 2003. Operating Income Operating income during 2004 was $666.9 million, a decrease of $99.1 million from 2003 operating income of $766 million. This decrease was primarily due to the $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business in 2003. Our operating margin in 2004 was 6.2% compared to 8.3% in 2003. Our operating margin decreased primarily as a result of higher raw material costs and the effect of increased sales. Other (Income) Expense Total other (income) expense increased by $12.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest expense increased to $204.8 million in 2004 from $181.1 million in 2003, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amended in August 2004. This charge was partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower interest rates 29 Table of Contents during 2004. There were no financing charges on preferred securities in 2004 as compared to $14.2 million in 2003. Our convertible preferred securities were converted into common stock in the second quarter of 2003. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.3% in 2004 compared to 38.0% in 2003. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Results by Segment As noted above, we had three reportable segments in 2004: the Dairy Group, WhiteWave Foods Company and the Specialty Foods Group. The key performance indicators of our segments are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Dairy Group Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,646.4 100.0 % $ 7,542.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,655.3 77.0 5,619.4 74.5 Gross profit 1,991.1 23.0 1,922.7 25.5 Operating costs and expenses 1,396.6 16.1 1,281.7 17.0 Total operating income $ 594.5 6.9 % $ 641.0 8.5 % The Dairy Groups net sales increased by approximately $1.10 billion, or 14.6%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 7,542.1 Acquisitions 386.2 5.1 % Divestitures (26.2 ) (0.4 ) Volume 6.3 0.1 Pricing and product mix 738.0 9.8 2004 Net sales $ 8,646.4 14.6 % The increase in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily results from increased pricing due to the pass through of higher raw milk costs in 2004. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not reflect the entire increase in raw material costs that we experienced. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2004 compared to 2003: Year Ended December 31* 2004 2003 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1) $ 8.44 (2) $ 7.47 (2) 13 % Class I butterfat mover(1) 1.95 (3) 1.19 (3) 64 Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 6.90 (2) 6.74 (2) 2 Class II butterfat minimum(4) 2.06 (3) 1.22 (3) 69 30 Table of Contents * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The other primary cause of the increase in the Dairy Groups net sales was acquisitions. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, Ross Swiss Dairies in January 2004, Kohler Mix Specialties in October 2003 and Melody Farms in June 2003, which we estimate contributed a combined total of $386.2 million in sales during 2004. These increases in sales were slightly offset by the divestiture in July 2003 of the frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. Volume change for all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was an increase of 0.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Volume sales of milk and cream, which were approximately 76% of the Dairy Groups 2004 sales, were up approximately 0.9% for the year compared to USDA data showing a 0.8% decline in total consumption of milk and cream in the U.S. during the year. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio was substantially higher in 2004 at 77% compared to 74.5% for 2003 primarily due to the increase in raw milk costs compared to the prior year. The average minimum price of Class I raw skim milk (as indicated by the Class I mover, described above) was 13% higher and the average Class I butterfat mover increased 64% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Our costs were also impacted by resin prices as they continued to rise to unprecedented levels. Higher resin prices impacted the costs of plastic bottles used in our production process by approximately $17 million. Due to a very competitive retail environment in 2004, we were unable to pass along the entire increase in raw material costs to our customers. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $114.9 million during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to (1) acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $61 million in operating costs; (2) higher fuel costs of which approximately $14 million was related to an increase in fuel prices and (3) an increase in insurance expense due to our claims experience. The increase in sales volumes also contributed to our higher operating expenses. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, primarily due to more favorable than expected resolution of previously accrued bad debt reserves. These bad debt reserves were recorded for certain customers that had experienced economic difficulty and a few large customers that sought bankruptcy protection over the past several years. The Dairy Groups operating expense ratio decreased to 16.1% in 2004 from 17.0% in 2003 due to the effect of increased sales. WhiteWave Foods Company Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,188.4 100.0 % $ 713.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 792.0 66.6 468.4 65.7 Gross profit 396.4 33.4 245.0 34.3 Operating costs and expenses 278.0 23.4 211.4 29.6 Total operating income $ 118.4 10.0 % $ 33.6 4.7 % 31 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by $475 million, or 66.6%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 713.4 Acquisitions 282.8 39.6 % Divestitures (4.0 ) (0.5 ) Volume 94.3 13.2 Pricing and product mix 101.9 14.3 2004 Net sales $ 1,188.4 66.6 % The most significant cause of the increase in WhiteWave Foods Companys sales was the acquisition of Horizon Organic effective January 1, 2004, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of LAND OLAKES East effective March 31, 2004. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales, as we shift our focus toward consumer oriented advertising and marketing, which is recorded as operating expense. Another significant cause of the increase in sales was increased volumes. Volume sales for the WhiteWave Foods Company, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased approximately 13.2% in 2004 due to the success of our brands, particularly Silk and International Delight. Silk volumes increased 25% and International Delight volumes increased 22% compared to 2003. We believe increased Silk volumes were due primarily to: (1) increased consumer acceptance of soy products, resulting in increased penetration of soymilk in the club, mass merchandiser and grocery channels; (2) the positive effects of our consumer advertising; and (3) the introduction of new Silk products with nutritional enhancements, new flavors and larger size offerings. We believe the increase in International Delight volumes is due primarily to consumer acceptance of new packaging introduced in 2003 and new low carb flavors introduced in 2004. These increases were offset slightly by the divestiture in July 2003 of the branded frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. The cost of sales ratio for the WhiteWave Foods Company increased to 66.6% in 2004 from 65.7% in 2003 primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly Class II butterfat and organic soybeans, and the addition of Horizon Organic, which has a higher cost of sales ratio. The average minimum price of Class II butterfat was 69% higher in 2004 than in 2003. Our average cost of organic soybeans was approximately 40% higher in 2004 than in 2003 primarily due to an increase in domestic organic soybean prices and the utilization of foreign grown organic soybeans, which have a higher price than domestic beans. Operating expenses increased approximately $66.6 million in 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $56 million in costs, and increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $11.5 million to distribution expenses. Marketing spending increased approximately 6% in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases were somewhat offset by a decline of approximately $16.1 million related to the expiration of the White Wave management incentive plan in March 2004. The operating expense ratio decreased to 23.4% during 2004 from 29.6% during the prior year primarily due to the relatively smaller increase in operating expense dollars compared to the increase in sales dollars. 32 Table of Contents Specialty Foods Group Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 676.8 100.0 % $ 684.2 100.0 % Cost of sales 536.7 79.3 514.9 75.3 Gross profit 140.1 20.7 169.3 24.7 Operating costs and expenses 71.7 10.6 68.0 9.9 Total operating income $ 68.4 10.1 % $ 101.3 14.8 % The Specialty Foods Groups net sales decreased by $7.4 million, or 1.1%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percentage (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 684.2 Acquisitions 6.7 1.0 % Volume (13.3 ) (2.0 ) Pricing and product mix (0.8 ) (0.1 ) 2004 Net sales $ 676.8 (1.1 )% The net decrease in sales was due primarily to an overall decline in volumes in the nutritional beverages and pickle categories. Pickle volumes declined 2% largely due to a decline in sales attributable to the bankruptcy of a large customer in 2003 and the loss of a large retail chain customer in 2004. Private label nutritional beverages sales, which include drinks in the weight loss/gain, meal supplement and sports categories, declined approximately $17 million, or 44%. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we exited the manufacturing of nutritional beverage products as a result of these significant volume declines during the year because we believed those volumes could not be replaced without a significant investment in capital and research and development. These decreases in sales were partly offset by an increase in non dairy powdered creamer sales due to increased sales to existing customers and higher pricing. Sales also increased slightly due to the acquisition of Cremora in December 2003. The Specialty Foods Groups cost of sales ratio increased to 79.3% in 2004 from 75.3% in 2003, primarily due to substantially higher commodity costs, particularly casein, soybean oil and cheese which increased by a combined total of approximately $19 million, as well as significant increases in glass and other packaging costs which increased approximately $3 million. Operating expenses for the Specialty Foods Group increased approximately $3.7 million primarily related to increased distribution expenses as a result of higher fuel costs. The Specialty Foods Groups operating expense ratio increased to 10.6% in 2004 compared to 9.9% during the prior year. 33 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 2% to $9.18 billion during 2003 from $8.99 billion in 2002. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales $ Increase/ % Increase/ 2003 2002 (Decrease) (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 7,542.1 $ 7,601.0 $ (58.9 ) (0.8 )% WhiteWave Foods Company 713.4 517.3 196.1 37.9 Specialty Foods Group 684.2 673.6 10.6 1.6 Corporate/ Other 244.9 199.6 45.3 22.7 Total $ 9,184.6 $ 8,991.5 $ 193.1 2.1 % The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2003 vs. 2002 Pricing, Volume Total Foreign and Product Increase/ Acquisitions Divestitures Exchange Mix Changes (Decrease) (In millions) Dairy Group $ 127.3 $ (110.7 ) $ $ (75.5 ) $ (58.9 ) WhiteWave Foods Company 68.8 (3.8 ) 131.1 196.1 Specialty Foods Group (13.7 ) 24.3 10.6 Corporate/ Other 40.3 5.0 45.3 Total $ 196.1 $ (128.2 ) $ 40.3 $ 84.9 $ 193.1 Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers; and costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Our cost of sales ratio was 74.1% in 2003 compared to 73.9% in 2002. Increased raw material costs affected all of our segments in 2003. Also, the WhiteWave Foods Company segment incurred higher costs due to certain manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new products and new technologies, and the realignment of certain manufacturing operations. Operating Costs and Expenses Operating expenses decreased approximately $75.7 million, or 4.5%, in 2003 compared to the prior year. This decrease was mostly due to (1) a gain of $66.2 million on the sale of frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations in the third quarter of 2003, (2) a gain of $2.5 million related to the divestiture of 11 facilities in 2001, which was recorded at corporate as a result of certain contingencies being favorably resolved during 2003, and (3) lower facility closing and other reorganization costs of $11.8 million in 2003 compared to $19.1 million in 2002, primarily due to differences in the nature of the restructuring activities and to the timing of recognition of certain charges as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, in January 2003. Our operating expense ratio decreased to 17.6% in 2003 as compared to 18.7% in 2002. Operating Income Operating income during 2003 was $766 million, an increase of $103.4 million, from 2002 operating income of $662.6 million. Our operating margin in 2003 was 8.3% compared to 7.4% in 2002. The operating margin increase was the result of the decline in the operating expense ratio primarily due to the other operating income reported in 2003. Other (Income) Expense Total other (income) expense decreased by $49.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest expense decreased to $181.1 million in 2003 from $197.7 million in 2002. This decrease was 34 Table of Contents the result of lower interest rates and lower average debt balances in 2003. Financing charges on preferred securities were $14.2 million in 2003 versus $33.6 million in 2002 due to the conversion of these securities to common stock during the second quarter of 2003. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was $244,000 in 2003 compared to a loss of $7.9 million in 2002. Income in 2003 was related to our approximately 13% interest in Horizon Organic Holding Corporation. In 2002, we recorded income of $2.1 million, which was primarily related to our 36% interest in White Wave through May 9, 2002, when we acquired the remaining equity interest in White Wave and began consolidating White Waves results with our financial results. This income was offset in 2002 by a $10 million loss on our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.0% in 2003 compared to 36.4% in 2002. In 2002 we recorded the favorable settlement of a contested tax issue. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Results by Segment As noted above, we had three reportable segments in 2004: the Dairy Group, the WhiteWave Foods Company and the Specialty Foods Group. Prior periods have been restated to reflect the new segment reporting structure. The key performance indicators of our segments are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Dairy Group Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 7,542.1 100.0 % $ 7,601.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 5,619.4 74.5 5,670.2 74.6 Gross profit 1,922.7 25.5 1,930.8 25.4 Operating costs and expenses 1,281.7 17.0 1,338.3 17.6 Total operating income $ 641.0 8.5 % $ 592.5 7.8 % The Dairy Groups net sales decreased approximately $58.9 million, or 0.8%, in 2003 versus 2002. The change in net sales from 2002 to 2003 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2002 Net sales $ 7,601.0 Acquisitions 127.3 1.7 % Divestitures (110.7 ) (1.5 ) Volume (159.6 ) (2.1 ) Pricing and product mix 84.1 1.1 2003 Net sales $ 7,542.1 (0.8 )% The Dairy Group acquired Kohler Mix Specialties in October 2003 and Melody Farms in June 2003. The Dairy Groups sales declined primarily due to lower sales volumes. Volume change for all products, excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, was a decline of 2.1% in 2003 compared to 2002. That volume change was driven primarily by the fluid dairy and ice cream categories. Equivalent gallons of fluid dairy products sold (including milk and cream) decreased by approximately 1.1% in 2003. We believe the decrease was due primarily to continued declining consumption of traditional fluid dairy products in some 35 Table of Contents parts of the country. Ice cream and ice cream novelty volumes declined by approximately 7% in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily because we sell our ice cream under private labels and local brands, and we believe we lost sales during the year to nationally branded products which were promoted more aggressively than our products. In addition, certain private label products historically sold by the Dairy Group, including sour cream, whipping cream and coffee creamers, were converted to sales of LAND O LAKES products, which are reported in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. Net sales also declined by approximately $110.7 million related to divestitures. We sold our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations in July 2003. In addition, beginning in January 2002, we began exiting from the Lactaid, Nestl Nesquik and Nestl Coffeemate co packing businesses due to the termination of the co packing agreements. Our transition out of the Lactaid co packing business was completed in February 2002 and our transition out of the Nestle co packing business was completed in February 2003. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in pricing. The increase in sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily results from higher raw milk costs in 2003 than in 2002, offset somewhat by price concessions that were granted in some markets due to competitive pressures. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2003 compared to 2002: Year Ended December 31* 2003 2002 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1) $ 7.47 (2) $ 7.01 (2) 7 % Class I butterfat mover(1) 1.19 (3) 1.21 (3) (2 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 6.74 (2) 7.62 (2) (12 ) Class II butterfat minimum(4) 1.22 (3) 1.20 (3) 2 * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover prices plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation, and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio remained consistent at 74.5% in 2003 compared to 74.6% in 2002. The Dairy Groups operating expenses decreased approximately $56.6 million to $1.28 billion in 2003 from $1.34 billion in 2002. The decrease in the Dairy Groups operating expenses was primarily due to lower insurance, advertising, bad debt and bonus expenses in 2003. Insurance costs (including the costs of self insurance) declined in 2003 as a result of better claims experience. Advertising expenses decreased in 2003 partially because we reduced planned advertising spending in 2003 in anticipation of the difficult raw milk environment and also because advertising expense in 2002 was higher than normal as we incurred unusual advertising costs in order to (1) promote our brands in certain parts of the country following our acquisition of Legacy Dean, and (2) promote two local Dairy Group brands affected by product recalls in 2002. Bad debt expense declined in 2003 compared to 2002. In 2002, some of our customers experienced economic difficulty and a few large customers sought bankruptcy protection. Bonus expenses were lower in 2003 than in 2002 as a result of our actual performance compared to bonus targets. 36 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Company Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 713.4 100.0 % $ 517.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 468.4 65.7 299.6 57.9 Gross profit 245.0 34.3 217.7 42.1 Operating costs and expenses 211.4 29.6 158.5 30.7 Total operating income $ 33.6 4.7 % $ 59.2 11.4 % WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by $196.1 million, or 37.9%, in 2003 compared to 2002. The change in net sales from 2002 to 2003 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2002 Net sales $ 517.3 Acquisitions 68.8 13.3 % Divestitures (3.8 ) (0.7 ) Volume 106.2 20.5 Pricing and product mix 24.9 4.8 2003 Net sales $ 713.4 37.9 % We acquired the 64% of White Wave that we did not already own in May 2002. Therefore, 2003 includes 12 months of White Wave sales compared to only 8 months in 2002. Unit volumes for WhiteWave Foods Company, excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, increased 20.5% overall in 2003 due to the success of our nationally branded products, particularly Silk. Sales increased due to pricing, product mix and other changes, including price increases for several of our products, such as Hersheys, Maries and LAND OLAKES. These price increases were partly offset by price reductions for International Delight in order to clear shelf space for new plastic packaging that was introduced in the first half of 2003. The cost of sales ratio for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to 65.7% in 2003 compared to 57.9% in 2002 primarily due to the impact of (1) short term manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new products and new technologies, (2) short term manufacturing inefficiencies due to certain manufacturing realignments related to the shifting of certain manufacturing operations to our Dairy Group Segment, and (3) an additional $15 million of packaging costs due to the introduction of International Delight in plastic packaging. Operating expenses were $211.4 million during 2003 compared to $158.5 million during 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing expenses in 2003 related to the introduction of new products and higher promotional spending on nationally branded products. Operating expenses were also significantly impacted by the addition of White Wave in May 2002, including the accrual of almost $10 million more in 2003 than in 2002 for bonuses paid in March 2004 under the White Wave Performance Bonus Plan that was established when we acquired White Wave. 37 Table of Contents Specialty Foods Group Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 684.2 100.0 % $ 673.6 100.0 % Cost of sales 514.9 75.3 498.1 73.9 Gross profit 169.3 24.7 175.5 26.1 Operating costs and expenses 68.0 9.9 76.6 11.4 Total operating income $ 101.3 14.8 % $ 98.9 14.7 % The Specialty Foods Groups net sales increased by $10.6 million, or 1.6%, in 2003 versus 2002. The change in net sales from 2002 to 2003 was due to the following: Dollars Percentage (Dollars in millions) 2002 Net sales $ 673.6 Divestitures (13.7 ) (2.0 )% Volume 15.9 2.4 Pricing and product mix 8.4 1.2 2003 Net sales $ 684.2 1.6 % The Specialty Foods Group sold EBI Foods, Ltd. in October 2002. Excluding the effects of this divestiture, the Specialty Foods Groups pickle volumes declined 1.6% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the bankruptcy of a large customer, and to the overall effects of economic difficulties in the foodservice sector as a whole. Approximately 28% of the Specialty Foods Groups sales were to foodservice customers in 2003. This decrease was more than offset by a 12.8% increase in unit volumes of non dairy powdered creamer as a result of new business and a 15.2% increase in unit volumes of nutritional beverages due to increased demand. Pricing was up in all categories primarily due to increased raw material costs that were passed on to customers in the form of higher selling prices. Also, promotional spending that is recorded as a reduction of net sales was down by $15.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The Specialty Foods Groups cost of sales ratio increased to 75.3% in 2003 from 73.9% in 2002 as a result of higher raw material prices, especially glass, and increases in natural gas prices. The Specialty Foods Group uses a significant amount of natural gas in its operations. Operating expenses for the Specialty Foods Group declined to $68 million in 2003 compared to $76.6 million in 2002 primarily due to the sale of EBI Foods, Ltd. in October 2002, which had higher operating expenses, and to lower bonus expense. Bonus expenses were $1.3 million less in 2003 as a result of our actual performance compared to bonus targets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow During 2004, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $527.7 million for 2004 as contrasted to $522.3 million for 2003, an increase of $5.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: An increase of $79.6 million in net income plus non cash items in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations in 2003 offset by; 38 Table of Contents An increase in our operating working capital of $183.9 in 2004 as compared to $175.6 million in 2003 due primarily to increased raw material costs in 2004; A decrease of $10 million in income taxes payable in 2004 compared to an increase of $27.9 million in 2003 as our 2004 estimated tax payments more closely approximated our tax obligation resulting in a lower tax liability at December 31, 2004; A decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $436,000 in 2004 compared to a decrease of $20.7 million in 2003 primarily due to higher dispositions of net assets held for sale in 2003; and Lower tax savings on equity compensation of $7.9 million due to fewer stock option exercises in 2004 compared to the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities was $746.6 million in 2004 compared to $436.2 million in 2003, an increase of $310.4 million. We used approximately $401.1 million for acquisitions and $356.1 million for capital expenditures in 2004 compared to $246.6 million and $291.7 million in 2003, respectively. We had cash proceeds from the sale of the frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations and one other small business of $90 million in 2003. We used approximately $297 million to repurchase our stock during 2004. Set forth in the chart below is a summary of the stock we repurchased in 2004: No. of Shares of Aggregate Average Common Stock Purchase Purchase Price Period Repurchased Price(1) Per Share (Dollars in millions except per share data) January 2004 150,000 $ 5.2 $ 34.42 August 2004 2,170,000 78.6 36.24 September 2004 5,655,000 173.5 30.69 October 2004 1,335,000 39.7 29.72 9,310,000 $ 297.0 31.90 (1) Includes commissions and fees. We received approximately $67.9 million in 2004 as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. We increased our net borrowings by $438.2 million in 2004 compared to a net borrowing of $27 million in 2003. Current Debt Obligations Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. Both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from 0 to 62.5 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 75 to 187.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 3.72% at December 31, 2004. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged $775 million of our borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 4.96%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. 39 Table of Contents Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows: $56.25 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008; $262.5 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2008 through June 30, 2009; and A final payment of $262.5 million on the maturity date of August 13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility until maturity on August 13, 2009. The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or recovery events. In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving credit facility that ranges from 25 to 37.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage and interest coverage ratio. We are currently, and have always been, in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval: (1) the acquired company is involved in the manufacture, processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any other line of business in which we are currently engaged, (2) the net cash purchase price is not greater than $500 million, (3) we acquire at least 51% of the acquired entity, (4) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target and (5) after giving effect to such acquisition on a pro forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of Legacy Deans subsidiaries, and the real property owned by Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries). The credit agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, and certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The credit agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our credit rating. In August 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to (1) increase the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, (2) increase the size of our term loan A from $850 million to $1.5 billion, (3) eliminate term loans B and C and (4) modify the interest rate and payment terms. When we amended our credit facility, we were required to write off approximately $32.6 million of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with our credit facility prior to the amendment. These costs were being amortized over the previous terms of the revolving credit facility and term loans. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding borrowings of $2.03 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $1.78 billion at December 31, 2003), including $1.5 billion in term loan borrowings and $531.1 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2004, there were $129.3 million of letters of credit under the revolving line that were issued but undrawn. As of March 11, 2005, approximately $1.80 billion was outstanding under our senior credit facility. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $500 million receivables backed credit facility, which had $500 million outstanding at December 31, 2004 (compared to $302.5 million at December 31, 2003). At December 31, 2004, there was no remaining availability under this facility. The average interest rate on this facility at December 31, 2004 was 2.83%. In January 2005, we amended our receivables backed loan to increase the facility to $600 million. Approximately $546 million was outstanding under this facility at 40 Table of Contents March 11, 2005. See Notes 9 and 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables backed facility. Our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility and receivables backed credit facility increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily to fund our acquisitions and share repurchases. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2004 included $700 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Legacy Deans senior notes, a $30.8 million line of credit at our Spanish subsidiary and approximately $30.9 million face value of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness, purchase and lease obligations at December 31, 2004. Please see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail about our lease and purchase obligations.

(2) Primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes, including organic soybeans, organic raw milk and cucumbers. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process. (3) Only includes our fixed rate interest obligations, which consist of our senior notes and our interest rate swap agreements. Other Long Term Liabilities We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As 41 Table of Contents such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. In 2004, we recorded non cash expense of $11 million, of which $9.1 million was attributable to periodic expense and $1.9 million was attributable to settlements compared to a total of $15.3 million in 2003, of which $2.5 million was attributable to settlements. These amounts were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We decreased the assumed discount rate from a range of 6.0% to 6.5% at December 31, 2003 to 5.75% at December 31, 2004. In selecting assumed rate of return on plan assets, we considered past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan, as well as our investment allocation policy. Plan asset returns were $14.8 million in 2004, a $10.2 million decrease from plan asset returns of $25 million in 2003. Net periodic pension expense for our plans is expected to decrease in 2005 to approximately $10.6 million due primarily to the increase in assets from $151.6 million as of December 31, 2003 to $181 million as of December 31, 2004. Based on current projections, 2005 funding requirements will be approximately $33.7 million as compared to $43.8 million for 2004. Additionally, based on current projections, 2005 funding requirements for our other postretirement benefit obligations will be approximately $1.8 million as compared to $2.8 million in 2004. As a result of lower discount rates at December 31, 2004, we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. The accumulated other comprehensive income component of the additional minimum liability, which totaled $23.3 million ($14.5 million net of tax), was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income, and did not affect net income for 2004. The charge to Other Comprehensive Income will be reversed in future periods to the extent the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. See Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Other Commitments and Contingencies On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments we make under this note, if any, will be expensed as incurred. We also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation, investigations and audits: certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested; certain lease obligations, which require us to guarantee the minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease; and selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations. 42 Table of Contents Future Capital Requirements During 2005, we intend to invest a total of approximately $300 million to $325 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. We intend to spend this amount as follows: Operating Division Amount (In millions) Dairy Group $ 175 to 180 WhiteWave Foods Company 105 to 110 Specialty Foods Group 5 to 10 Other 15 to 25 Total $ 300 to 325 In 2005, we expect cash interest to be approximately $170 million based on current debt levels and cash taxes to be approximately $85 million to $95 million. We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. As of March 11, 2005, approximately $1.08 billion was available for future borrowings under our senior credit facility. Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs Dairy Group The primary raw material used in our Dairy Group is raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat). The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw milk, and those prices change on a monthly basis. The regulated minimum prices differ based on how the raw milk is utilized. Raw milk processed into fluid milk is priced at the Class I price, and raw milk processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream is priced at the Class II price. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain producer premiums (or over order premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw milk costs, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in our raw milk costs can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices that it charges for Class I dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw milk and other materials fluctuate. Prices for some Class II products are not changed on a monthly basis, but are changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. There can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, especially in the case of Class II butterfat because Class II butterfat prices for each month are not announced by the government until after the end of that month. Also, in some cases we are competitively or contractually constrained with the means and timing of implementing price changes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margin fluctuate with the price of our raw materials and other inputs. In 2004, our Dairy Group was adversely affected by extreme volatility in the prices of raw skim milk and butterfat. In 2005, we expect prices to be somewhat less volatile and lower than the average price in 2004. Of course raw milk prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. If raw milk prices do remain at or near current levels throughout 2005, we would expect our sales for 2005 to be less than in 2004 because, in general, we change the prices of our products to reflect changes in raw material prices. Because our Class II products typically have a higher fat content than that contained in raw milk, we also purchase bulk cream for use in some of our Class II products. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a 43 Table of Contents multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The prices of AA butter started rising by moderate amounts in late 2003, and then increased significantly in 2004. They remained high throughout 2004 and we expect the average price to be somewhat lower in 2005 than the average price in 2004. Of course, like raw milk prices, bulk cream prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. We try to change our prices based on changes in the price of bulk cream, but sometimes we are competitively or contractually constrained. Therefore, increases in bulk cream prices can have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Prices for resin, which is used in plastic milk bottles, are also extremely high and are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Finally, the Dairy Group uses a great deal of diesel fuel in its direct store delivery system, and diesel fuel prices are currently very high and expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. High or volatile fuel and resin costs can adversely affect the Dairy Groups profitability. WhiteWave Foods Company A significant raw material used to manufacture products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company is organic soybeans. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs for 2005. Generally, these agreements provide for pricing at fixed levels. However, should our need for organic soybeans exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we would be required to pay would likely be significantly higher. The increase in soymilk consumption combined with the increased demand for organic cattle feed has put pressure on the supply of organic soybeans and there is significant upward pressure on organic soybean prices. We believe prices for organic soybeans will continue to increase as the pressure on supply continues. Another significant raw material used in our organic products is organic raw milk. Organic raw milk is not readily available and the growth of our organic dairy business depends on us being able to procure sufficient quantities of organic raw milk in time to meet our needs. We obtain our supply of organic raw milk by entering into one to two year agreements with farmers pursuant to which the farmers agree to sell us specified quantities of organic raw milk for fixed prices for the duration of the agreement We believe, based on currently projected sales levels, that we have secured a sufficient supply of raw organic milk to meet our raw organic milk needs for the remainder of 2005. However, should our need for organic raw milk exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we would be required to pay, if we could obtain supply at all, would likely be significantly higher. Also, as our contracts with farmers expire, we are generally required to agree to higher prices to renew as a result of increased competition for organic raw milk supply. For competitive reasons, WhiteWave Foods Company is not able to pass along price increases to customers as quickly as the Dairy Group. Specialty Foods Group Many of the raw materials used by our Specialty Foods Group also rose to unusually high levels during 2004, including soybean oil, casein, cheese and packaging materials. High fuel costs have also had a negative impact on the Specialty Foods Groups results. Prices for many of these raw materials and packaging materials used by the Specialty Foods Group are expected to remain high and in some cases increase in 2005. For competitive reasons, the Specialty Foods Group is not able to pass along increases in raw material and other input costs as quickly as the Dairy Group. Therefore, the current raw material environment is expected to continue to adversely affect the Specialty Foods Groups financial results in 2005. Competitive Environment There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery industry in recent years, and this trend is continuing. As our customer base consolidates, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or gain new customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. 44 Table of Contents Many of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current intensely competitive environment. Over the past few years, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group and Specialty Foods Group segments, which reduced our profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend to continue. In bidding situations we are subject to the risk of losing certain customers altogether. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have contracts with many of our largest customers, and most of the contracts that we do have are generally terminable at will by the customer. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail level have caused competition to become increasingly intense at the processor level. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Tax Rate Our 2004 tax rate was 38.3%. We estimate the effective tax for 2005 to be slightly less than 38%. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as recent and proposed changes to federal and state tax codes may cause the rate to change from historical rates. See Risk Factors for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Accounts Receivable We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. As these factors change, our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $24.2 million, or approximately 3% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004. The allowance for doubtful accounts, expressed as a percent of accounts receivable, was approximately 4% at December 31, 2003. Each 0.10% change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately $880,000. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $4.14 billion as of December 31, 2004 resulting primarily from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. We believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support. Perpetual trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual trademark is impaired if its book value 45 Table of Contents exceeds fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A reporting unit can be a segment or an operating division. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual trademarks or goodwill during 2004. Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period, which could have an impact on our earnings. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our valuation allowance increased $1.2 million in 2004 due to the increased likelihood that state net operating losses will expire before they are used. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $146.1 million and $136.3 million, respectively, including both current and long term liabilities. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits to our employees including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual 46 Table of Contents basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. In 2004, we consolidated substantially all of our qualified pension plans into one master trust. We retained investment consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to help our Investment Committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust. Our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at 65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. At December 31, 2004, our master trust was invested as follows: equity securities and limited partnerships 74%; fixed income securities 25%; and cash and cash equivalents 1%. We determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plans investments based on target allocations of the pension plans investments. Additionally, we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plans investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other investments. The resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.5%. While a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature, including assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and mortality rates, generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions. As such, our discount rate likely will change more frequently. In 2004 we reduced the discount rate utilized to determine our estimated future benefit obligations from a range of 6.0% to 6.5% at December 31, 2003 to 5.75% at December 31, 2004. A 0.25% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $412,000 and $489,000, respectively. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $184,000. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits in an attempt to improve financial statement disclosures regarding defined benefit plans. This standard requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and other relevant information. In addition to expanded annual disclosures, we are required to report the various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003) is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and for quarters beginning after December 15, 2003. The expanded disclosure requirements are included in this report. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In April 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 106 2 to address the accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Act. The FSP is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after September 15, 2004. Substantially all of our postretirement benefits terminate at age 65. Therefore, the FSP will have no material affect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in December 2004. It will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant date fair values. That cost will be recognized over the vesting period. SFAS No. 123(R) will become effective for us in the third quarter 2005. We are still evaluating the impact of 47 Table of Contents SFAS No. 123(R) on our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not yet determined the transition method we will apply when we adopt the statement. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Based Compensation for illustrations of the pro forma impact of expensing our stock options in the historical periods. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151, which is effective for inventory costs incurred during years beginning after June 15, 2005, clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the rule in APB No. 29 which excluded from fair value measurement exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead, SFAS No. 153 excludes from fair value measurement exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. Reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company Segment Could Temporarily Adversely Affect the Performance of the Segment In the third quarter of 2004, we began the process of consolidating the operations of the three operating units that comprise our WhiteWave Foods Company segment into a single business. We have completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization for the three companies, and in the third quarter of 2005, the employees of the new company will move to a new headquarters located in Broomfield, Colorado. The full integration of these businesses will be a lengthy process involving all aspects of the three companys operations, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and administration, and will include the selection and implementation of a new information technology platform. As part of our overall reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company into a unified branded consumer packaged goods company, we also intend to bring in house certain manufacturing activities that are currently being done by third parties. We expect the consolidation to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. This process presents a number of challenges and requires a significant amount of managements attention. Our failure to successfully manage this process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, effective March 11, 2005, Mr. Steve Demos, President of WhiteWave Foods Company resigned his position. We have retained a leading executive recruiting firm to assist in the search for a new president. Mr. Gregg Engles, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, has assumed direct leadership of WhiteWave Foods Company on an interim basis. This transition could be disruptive to us in the short term. 48 Table of Contents Spin Off of our Specialty Foods Group In January 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. Separating the Specialty Foods Group segment from our business, and completing the successful spin off will require a number of operational, legal and regulatory steps be successfully completed. Completing these steps presents a number of challenges and will require a significant amount of managements attention. Our failure to successfully manage the process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales. In addition, the spin off is dependent upon the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on the tax free nature of the transaction. If we fail to receive a favorable letter ruling, the spin off will not occur. Recent Financial Difficulty at Specialty Foods Group Segment Could Continue Longer Than We Expect Our Specialty Foods Group segment experienced financial difficulty during 2004 due primarily to rising input costs and to a decline in demand for Specialty Foods Groups line of nutritional beverages. We exited the nutritional beverages business at the end of 2004. Also, the former President of the Specialty Foods Group segment returned to run the business in late October. With these changes and certain other changes we are implementing at the Specialty Foods Group, it is our goal to return the Specialty Foods Group segment to its historical levels of profitability in 2005. However, there can be no assurance as to how long it will take to return the Specialty Foods Group to its historical levels of profitability, if ever. Many factors are beyond our control, such as the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies and competitive pressures that limit our ability to raise prices in reaction to increased input costs. Recent Successes of Our Products Could Attract Increased Competitive Activity, Which Could Impede Our Growth Rate and Cost Us Sales and, in the Case of Organic Products, Put Pressure on the Availability of Raw Materials Our Silk soymilk and Horizon Organic organic food and beverage products have leading market shares in their categories and have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories. As soy and organic products continue to gain in popularity with consumers, we expect our products in these categories to continue to attract competitors. Many large food and beverage companies have substantially more resources than we do and they may be able to market their soy and organic products more successfully than us, which could cause our growth rate in these categories to be slower than our forecast and could cause us to lose sales. The increase in popularity of soy and organic milks is also attracting private label competitors who sell their products at a lower price. The success of private label brands could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Finally, there is a limited supply of organic raw materials in the United States, especially organic soybeans and organic raw milk. New entrants into our markets can reduce available supply and drive up costs. Even without new entrants, our own rapid growth can put pressure on the availability and price of organic raw materials. Our International Delight coffee creamer competes intensely with Nestl CoffeeMate business, and our Hersheys milks and milkshakes compete intensely with Nestl Nesquik. Nestle has significantly greater resources than we do, which allows them to promote their products more aggressively. Our failure to successfully compete with Nestle could have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of our International Delight and or our Hersheys businesses. Loss of Rights to Any of Our Licensed Brands Could Adversely Affect Our Sales and Profits We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Borden, Hersheys, LAND OLAKES, Pet and others. In some cases, we have invested significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents We Have Substantial Debt and Other Financial Obligations and We May Incur Even More Debt We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. The interest rate on our debt is based on our debt rating, as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. We have no ability to control the ratings issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. A downgrade in our debt rating could cause our interest rate to increase, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our targeted profitability level, as well as our cash flow. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our net income. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities, we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations. We intend to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group. Our Specialty Foods Group generates positive cash flow from operations. The loss of income from the Specialty Foods Group will cause compliance with our debt covenant ratios to become more difficult. We intend to pay down some of our debt in 2005 to offset the effect of the Specialty Foods Group spin off on our ratios; however, there can be no assurance that we will successfully pay down our debt. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2004: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 $ 400 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 375 The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2003: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 1.48% to 6.69% December 2004 $ 650 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 400 6.78% December 2006 75 50 Table of Contents We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $20.7 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2004 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. During 2004, we recognized losses of $2.5 million, net of tax, related to our butterfat hedging activities. 51 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview We are a leading food and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the United States. The Dairy Group manufactures and sells its products under a variety of local and regional brand names and under customer private labels. Our WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, markets and sells a variety of well known soy, dairy and dairy related nationally branded products including, for example: Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy products, juices and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; Maries refrigerated dips and dressings; and LAND O LAKES fluid dairy and cultured products. Our Specialty Foods Group is the leading private label pickle processor in the United States and a maker of a variety of other food products. In January 2005, we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. See Developments Since January 1, 2004 Tax Free Spin Off of Specialty Foods Group. We also own the fourth largest dairy processor in Spain. Dairy Group Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment, with approximately 80% of our consolidated sales in 2004. Our Dairy Group manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream, cultured dairy products and juices to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across the United States. The Dairy Group also manufactures a portion of the products marketed and sold by WhiteWave Foods Company. Due to the perishable nature of the Dairy Groups products, our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to its customers stores in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a direct store delivery or DSD system and we believe we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by the Dairy Groups corporate sales department. Most of the Dairy Groups customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The Dairy Groups sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be higher in the third and fourth quarters. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. Since 1990, the dairy industry has experienced significant consolidation led in part by us. Consolidation has tended to lower costs and raise efficiency. However, consumption of traditional fluid dairy products has continued to decline. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 10% from 1990 to the end of 2003, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume sales growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic, in addition to the significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation, and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. WhiteWave Foods Company The WhiteWave Foods Companys operations have historically been conducted through three distinct operating units: White Wave, Inc. (White Wave), Horizon Organic and Dean National Brand Group. We are currently in the process of consolidating these three operating units and 23 Table of Contents expect the consolidation to be completed in 2006. WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, develops, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy products, juices and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; and LAND OLAKES creamers and cultured products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells Sun Soy soymilk; The Organic Cow of Vermont organic dairy products; White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu; Hersheys milks and milkshakes; Maries dips and dressings; and Naturally Yours sour cream. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. In 2004, approximately 84% of WhiteWave Foods Companys sales were to retailers and approximately 8% were to foodservice outlets. WhiteWave Foods Companys customer base is diverse, with no single customer representing more than 10% of sales in 2004. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products are sold pursuant to customer purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many different factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Specialty Foods Group Our Specialty Foods Group is the nations leading private label pickle processor, and one of the largest manufacturers and sellers of non dairy powdered creamer in the United States. The Specialty Foods Group also manufactures and sells a variety of other foods, such as aseptic sauces and puddings. In January 2005 we announced our intention to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment. See Developments since January 1, 2004. The Specialty Foods Groups products are delivered to customers stores and warehouses primarily by common carrier. The Specialty Foods Group sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the Specialty Foods Groups customers purchase products from the Specialty Foods Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The Specialty Foods Group has several competitors in each of its product markets. In sales of private label products, the principal competitive factors are price relative to other private label suppliers, product quality and quality of service. For the Specialty Foods Groups branded products, competition to obtain shelf space with retailers is based on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. In certain cases, the Specialty Foods Group pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular company branded product. Competition for consumer sales is based on brand recognition, price, taste preferences, and quality. International Group Our International Group, which does not qualify as a reportable segment, manufactures, markets and sells private label and branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. Also, effective January 1, 2005, our Rachels Organic Dairy business, which has historically been part of Horizon Organics operations, was transferred to the International Group. 24 Table of Contents Developments Since January 1, 2004 Reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company In the third quarter of 2004, we announced our intention to consolidate the three businesses included within our WhiteWave Foods Company segment (formerly the Branded Products Group segment) into a single operating unit. We believe this consolidation will allow us to interact with customers more efficiently and effectively as a single sales and marketing organization, and will enable us to create a simplified and more efficient supply chain for our branded business. We have completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization for the three companies, and in the third quarter of 2005, the employees of the new company will move to a new headquarters located in Broomfield, Colorado. The full integration of these businesses will be a lengthy process involving all aspects of the three companies operations, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and administration, and will include the selection and implementation of a new information technology platform. As part of our overall reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company into a unified branded consumer packaged goods company, we also intend to bring in house certain manufacturing activities that are currently being done by third parties. In addition, effective March 11, 2005, Mr. Steve Demos, President of WhiteWave Foods Company resigned his position. We have retained a leading executive recruiting firm to assist in the search for a new president. Mr. Gregg Engles, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, has assumed direct leadership of WhiteWave Foods Company on an interim basis. Tax Free Spin Off of Specialty Foods Group On January 27, 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group. The spin off will create a publicly traded food manufacturing company serving the retail grocery and foodservice markets with approximately 1,800 employees and estimated 2005 net sales of over $700 million. Also effective January 27, 2005, we hired a management team, headed by Sam Reed, former CEO of Keebler Foods Company, to lead the new company. In conjunction with their employment, the management team made a cash investment of $10 million in the Specialty Foods Group, representing 1.7% ownership of the new business. As part of the spin off, we intend to transfer our Mocha Mix non dairy creamer, Second Nature egg substitute and foodservice salad dressings businesses to the Specialty Foods Group from WhiteWave Foods Company and our Dairy Group. The spin off is intended to take the form of a tax free distribution to our shareholders of a new publicly traded stock, which we expect to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We expect the spin off to be completed in the third quarter of 2005, subject to confirmation by the Internal Revenue Service of the tax free nature of the transaction, registration of the new security with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other customary closing conditions. Acquisitions Milk Products of Alabama On October 15, 2004, our Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama, a dairy manufacturer based in Decatur, Alabama. Milk Products of Alabama had net sales of approximately $34 million in 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we have expanded our production capabilities in the southeastern United States, allowing us to better serve our customers. Milk Products of Alabamas results of operations are now included in the Morningstar division of our Dairy Group. We paid approximately $23.2 million for the purchase of Milk Products of Alabama, including costs of acquisition, and funded the purchase price with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Tiger Foods On May 31, 2004, Leche Celta, our Spanish subsidiary, acquired Tiger Foods, a dairy processing business with one facility located in Avila, Spain. Tiger Foods, which had net sales of approximately $29 million in 25 Table of Contents 2003, manufactures and distributes branded and private label UHT milk and dairy based drinks throughout Spain, with an emphasis in the southern and central regions. Tiger Foods operations complement our Spanish operations and we expect this acquisition to allow us to reduce our transportation costs for raw milk and finished products due to the new facilitys geographic proximity to our raw milk suppliers and certain customers. We paid approximately $21.9 million for the purchase of the company, all of which was funded with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Soy Processing Facility On April 5, 2004, our WhiteWave Foods Company acquired a soy processing and packaging facility located in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Prior to the acquisition, the previous owner of the facility co packed Silk products for us at the facility. As a result of the acquisition, we have increased our in house processing and packaging capabilities for our soy products, resulting in cost reductions. We paid approximately $25.7 million for the purchase of the facility, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility. LAND OLAKES East In 2002, we purchased a perpetual license to use the LAND OLAKES brand on certain dairy products nationally, excluding cheese and butter. This perpetual license was subject, however, to a pre existing sublicense entitling a competitor to manufacture and sell cream, sour cream and whipping cream in certain channels in the eastern United States. Effective March 31, 2004, we acquired that sublicense and certain customer relationships of the sublicensee (LAND OLAKES East) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17 million, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility. We now have the exclusive right to use the LAND OLAKES brand on certain dairy products (other than cheese and butter) throughout the entire United States. Ross Swiss Dairies On January 26, 2004, our Dairy Group acquired Ross Swiss Dairies, a dairy distributor based in Los Angeles, California, which had net sales of approximately $120 million in 2003. As a result of this acquisition, we have increased the distribution capability of our Dairy Group in southern California, allowing us to better serve our customers. Ross Swiss Dairies has historically purchased a significant portion of its products from other processors. Now the majority of products distributed by Ross Swiss Dairies are manufactured in our southern California facilities. We paid approximately $21.8 million, including transaction costs, for the purchase of Ross Swiss Dairies and funded the purchase price with borrowings under our receivables backed facility. Horizon Organic On January 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of the 87% of Horizon Organic Holding Corporation (Horizon Organic) that we did not already own. Horizon Organic had sales of over $200 million during 2003. We already owned approximately 13% of the outstanding common stock of Horizon Organic as a result of investments made in 1998. Third party co packers, including us, have historically done all of Horizon Organics manufacturing. During 2003, we produced approximately 27% of Horizon Organics fluid dairy products. We also distributed Horizon Organics products in several parts of the country. Horizon Organic is a leading branded organic foods company in the United States. Because organic foods are gaining popularity with consumers and because Horizon Organics products offer consumers an alternative to our Dairy Groups traditional dairy products, we believe Horizon Organic is an important addition to our portfolio of brands. The aggregate purchase price for the 87% of Horizon Organic that we did not already own was approximately $287 million, including approximately $217 million of cash paid to Horizon Organics stockholders, the repayment of approximately $40 million of borrowings under Horizon Organics former credit facility, and transaction expenses of approximately $9 million, all of which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit facility and our receivables backed facility. In addition, each of the options to purchase Horizon Organics common stock outstanding on January 2, 2004 was converted into an option to purchase 26 Table of Contents ..7301 shares of our stock, with an aggregate fair value of approximately $21 million. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004, Horizon Organics financial results are reported in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our acquisitions. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities As part of our continued reorganization and cost reduction efforts in our Dairy Group, we closed eight Dairy Group facilities in 2004. The closed facilities were located in Lansing, Michigan; Wilkesboro, North Carolina; Madison, Wisconsin; Sulphur Springs, Texas; San Leandro and South Gate, California; Westwego, Louisiana and Pocatello, Idaho. On September 7, 2004, we announced our plan to exit the nutritional beverages business operated by our Specialty Foods Group segment, including the closure of a manufacturing facility in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In 2004, we experienced significant declines in volume on this product line and we believed those volumes could not be replaced without a significant investment in capital and research and development. We ceased nutritional beverages production in December 2004. We recorded a total of approximately $34.7 million in facility closing and reorganization costs during 2004. We expect to incur additional charges related to these restructuring plans of approximately $7.1 million, primarily in 2005. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities, including termination of certain contractual agreements; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our facility closing and reorganization activities. Construction of New Facilities During 2004, our Dairy Group completed construction of a new dairy manufacturing and distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. This facility commenced operations in the third quarter of 2004 and allows us to better serve the southern Nevada, Arizona and southern Colorado markets. In addition, Leche Celta finished construction of our first dairy manufacturing facility in Portugal in the fourth quarter of 2004. The new facility is located in Alpiarca, Portugal and commenced production in December 2004. The new facility allows us to expand our Iberian operations. Stock Buyback During 2004, we spent approximately $297 million, including commissions and fees, to repurchase 9.3 million shares of our common stock for an average purchase price of $31.90 per share. At March 11, 2005, approximately $118 million remained available under our current authorization. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Table of Contents Amendment to Credit Facility In August 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to (1) increase the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, (2) increase the size of our term loan A from $850 million to $1.5 billion, (3) eliminate term loans B and C and (4) modify the interest rate and payment terms. When we amended our credit facility, we were required to write off approximately $32.6 million of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with our credit facility prior to the amendment. These costs were being amortized over the previous terms of the revolving credit facility and term loans. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations The following table presents certain information concerning our financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 10,822.3 100.0 % $ 9,184.6 100.0 % $ 8,991.5 100.0 % Cost of sales 8,257.8 76.3 6,808.2 74.1 6,642.8 73.9 Gross profit 2,564.5 23.7 2,376.4 25.9 2,348.7 26.1 Operating costs and expenses: Selling and distribution 1,512.5 14.0 1,345.1 14.6 1,321.8 14.7 General and administrative 349.7 3.2 317.3 3.5 337.5 3.7 Amortization of intangibles 6.6 0.1 4.9 0.1 7.8 0.1 Facility closing and reorganization costs 34.7 0.3 11.8 0.1 19.0 0.2 Other operating income (5.9 ) (0.1 ) (68.7 ) (0.7 ) Total operating costs and expenses 1,897.6 17.5 1,610.4 17.6 1,686.1 18.7 Total operating income $ 666.9 6.2 % $ 766.0 8.3 % $ 662.6 7.4 % Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 17.8% to $10.82 billion during 2004 from $9.18 billion in 2003. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales $ Increase/ % Increase/ 2004 2003 (Decrease) (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 8,646.4 $ 7,542.1 $ 1,104.3 14.6 % WhiteWave Foods Company 1,188.4 713.4 475.0 66.6 Specialty Foods Group 676.8 684.2 (7.4 ) (1.1 ) Corporate/ Other 310.7 244.9 65.8 26.9 Total $ 10,822.3 $ 9,184.6 $ 1,637.7 17.8 % 28 Table of Contents The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2004 vs. 2003 Pricing, Volume Total Foreign and Product Increase/ Acquisitions Divestitures Exchange Mix Changes (Decrease) (In millions) Dairy Group $ 386.2 $ (26.2 ) $ $ 744.3 $ 1,104.3 WhiteWave Foods Company 282.8 (4.0 ) 196.2 475.0 Specialty Foods Group 6.7 (14.1 ) (7.4 ) Corporate/ Other 18.0 28.1 19.7 65.8 Total $ 693.7 $ (30.2 ) $ 28.1 $ 946.1 $ 1,637.7 Net sales increased approximately $1.64 billion during 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher selling prices resulting from the pass through of increased raw milk costs and due to acquisitions. We acquired Kohler Mix Specialties, Melody Farms and Ross Swiss Dairies in our Dairy Group segment; Horizon Organic and LAND OLAKES East in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment; Cremora in our Specialty Foods Group segment; and Tiger Foods in our Corporate/ Other segment. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers; and costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Our cost of sales ratio increased to 76.3% in 2004 compared to 74.1% in 2003 due almost entirely to increased raw material costs that affected all of our segments in 2004. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $287.2 million, or approximately 17.8%, during 2004 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Acquisitions, which we estimate represented approximately $118 million of the increase. A $62.8 million decline in other operating income compared to last year primarily due to a $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business that reduced operating expenses in 2003. Higher fuel costs across all segments and increased volumes at the WhiteWave Foods Company, which we estimate added a combined total of approximately $29 million to distribution costs for 2004 as compared to last year. Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $22.9 million higher than 2003. Corporate expenses that were approximately $10 million higher than last year, including higher professional fees and legal fees primarily related to the reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company, increased transactional activity and higher regulatory compliance fees. Our operating expense ratio was consistent at 17.5% for 2004 as compared to 17.6% for 2003. Operating Income Operating income during 2004 was $666.9 million, a decrease of $99.1 million from 2003 operating income of $766 million. This decrease was primarily due to the $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business in 2003. Our operating margin in 2004 was 6.2% compared to 8.3% in 2003. Our operating margin decreased primarily as a result of higher raw material costs and the effect of increased sales. Other (Income) Expense Total other (income) expense increased by $12.1 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest expense increased to $204.8 million in 2004 from $181.1 million in 2003, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amended in August 2004. This charge was partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower interest rates 29 Table of Contents during 2004. There were no financing charges on preferred securities in 2004 as compared to $14.2 million in 2003. Our convertible preferred securities were converted into common stock in the second quarter of 2003. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.3% in 2004 compared to 38.0% in 2003. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Results by Segment As noted above, we had three reportable segments in 2004: the Dairy Group, WhiteWave Foods Company and the Specialty Foods Group. The key performance indicators of our segments are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Dairy Group Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,646.4 100.0 % $ 7,542.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,655.3 77.0 5,619.4 74.5 Gross profit 1,991.1 23.0 1,922.7 25.5 Operating costs and expenses 1,396.6 16.1 1,281.7 17.0 Total operating income $ 594.5 6.9 % $ 641.0 8.5 % The Dairy Groups net sales increased by approximately $1.10 billion, or 14.6%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 7,542.1 Acquisitions 386.2 5.1 % Divestitures (26.2 ) (0.4 ) Volume 6.3 0.1 Pricing and product mix 738.0 9.8 2004 Net sales $ 8,646.4 14.6 % The increase in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily results from increased pricing due to the pass through of higher raw milk costs in 2004. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not reflect the entire increase in raw material costs that we experienced. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2004 compared to 2003: Year Ended December 31* 2004 2003 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1) $ 8.44 (2) $ 7.47 (2) 13 % Class I butterfat mover(1) 1.95 (3) 1.19 (3) 64 Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 6.90 (2) 6.74 (2) 2 Class II butterfat minimum(4) 2.06 (3) 1.22 (3) 69 30 Table of Contents * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The other primary cause of the increase in the Dairy Groups net sales was acquisitions. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, Ross Swiss Dairies in January 2004, Kohler Mix Specialties in October 2003 and Melody Farms in June 2003, which we estimate contributed a combined total of $386.2 million in sales during 2004. These increases in sales were slightly offset by the divestiture in July 2003 of the frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. Volume change for all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, was an increase of 0.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Volume sales of milk and cream, which were approximately 76% of the Dairy Groups 2004 sales, were up approximately 0.9% for the year compared to USDA data showing a 0.8% decline in total consumption of milk and cream in the U.S. during the year. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio was substantially higher in 2004 at 77% compared to 74.5% for 2003 primarily due to the increase in raw milk costs compared to the prior year. The average minimum price of Class I raw skim milk (as indicated by the Class I mover, described above) was 13% higher and the average Class I butterfat mover increased 64% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Our costs were also impacted by resin prices as they continued to rise to unprecedented levels. Higher resin prices impacted the costs of plastic bottles used in our production process by approximately $17 million. Due to a very competitive retail environment in 2004, we were unable to pass along the entire increase in raw material costs to our customers. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $114.9 million during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to (1) acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $61 million in operating costs; (2) higher fuel costs of which approximately $14 million was related to an increase in fuel prices and (3) an increase in insurance expense due to our claims experience. The increase in sales volumes also contributed to our higher operating expenses. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, primarily due to more favorable than expected resolution of previously accrued bad debt reserves. These bad debt reserves were recorded for certain customers that had experienced economic difficulty and a few large customers that sought bankruptcy protection over the past several years. The Dairy Groups operating expense ratio decreased to 16.1% in 2004 from 17.0% in 2003 due to the effect of increased sales. WhiteWave Foods Company Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,188.4 100.0 % $ 713.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 792.0 66.6 468.4 65.7 Gross profit 396.4 33.4 245.0 34.3 Operating costs and expenses 278.0 23.4 211.4 29.6 Total operating income $ 118.4 10.0 % $ 33.6 4.7 % 31 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by $475 million, or 66.6%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 713.4 Acquisitions 282.8 39.6 % Divestitures (4.0 ) (0.5 ) Volume 94.3 13.2 Pricing and product mix 101.9 14.3 2004 Net sales $ 1,188.4 66.6 % The most significant cause of the increase in WhiteWave Foods Companys sales was the acquisition of Horizon Organic effective January 1, 2004, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of LAND OLAKES East effective March 31, 2004. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales, as we shift our focus toward consumer oriented advertising and marketing, which is recorded as operating expense. Another significant cause of the increase in sales was increased volumes. Volume sales for the WhiteWave Foods Company, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, increased approximately 13.2% in 2004 due to the success of our brands, particularly Silk and International Delight. Silk volumes increased 25% and International Delight volumes increased 22% compared to 2003. We believe increased Silk volumes were due primarily to: (1) increased consumer acceptance of soy products, resulting in increased penetration of soymilk in the club, mass merchandiser and grocery channels; (2) the positive effects of our consumer advertising; and (3) the introduction of new Silk products with nutritional enhancements, new flavors and larger size offerings. We believe the increase in International Delight volumes is due primarily to consumer acceptance of new packaging introduced in 2003 and new low carb flavors introduced in 2004. These increases were offset slightly by the divestiture in July 2003 of the branded frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. The cost of sales ratio for the WhiteWave Foods Company increased to 66.6% in 2004 from 65.7% in 2003 primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly Class II butterfat and organic soybeans, and the addition of Horizon Organic, which has a higher cost of sales ratio. The average minimum price of Class II butterfat was 69% higher in 2004 than in 2003. Our average cost of organic soybeans was approximately 40% higher in 2004 than in 2003 primarily due to an increase in domestic organic soybean prices and the utilization of foreign grown organic soybeans, which have a higher price than domestic beans. Operating expenses increased approximately $66.6 million in 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $56 million in costs, and increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $11.5 million to distribution expenses. Marketing spending increased approximately 6% in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases were somewhat offset by a decline of approximately $16.1 million related to the expiration of the White Wave management incentive plan in March 2004. The operating expense ratio decreased to 23.4% during 2004 from 29.6% during the prior year primarily due to the relatively smaller increase in operating expense dollars compared to the increase in sales dollars. 32 Table of Contents Specialty Foods Group Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 676.8 100.0 % $ 684.2 100.0 % Cost of sales 536.7 79.3 514.9 75.3 Gross profit 140.1 20.7 169.3 24.7 Operating costs and expenses 71.7 10.6 68.0 9.9 Total operating income $ 68.4 10.1 % $ 101.3 14.8 % The Specialty Foods Groups net sales decreased by $7.4 million, or 1.1%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percentage (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 684.2 Acquisitions 6.7 1.0 % Volume (13.3 ) (2.0 ) Pricing and product mix (0.8 ) (0.1 ) 2004 Net sales $ 676.8 (1.1 )% The net decrease in sales was due primarily to an overall decline in volumes in the nutritional beverages and pickle categories. Pickle volumes declined 2% largely due to a decline in sales attributable to the bankruptcy of a large customer in 2003 and the loss of a large retail chain customer in 2004. Private label nutritional beverages sales, which include drinks in the weight loss/gain, meal supplement and sports categories, declined approximately $17 million, or 44%. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we exited the manufacturing of nutritional beverage products as a result of these significant volume declines during the year because we believed those volumes could not be replaced without a significant investment in capital and research and development. These decreases in sales were partly offset by an increase in non dairy powdered creamer sales due to increased sales to existing customers and higher pricing. Sales also increased slightly due to the acquisition of Cremora in December 2003. The Specialty Foods Groups cost of sales ratio increased to 79.3% in 2004 from 75.3% in 2003, primarily due to substantially higher commodity costs, particularly casein, soybean oil and cheese which increased by a combined total of approximately $19 million, as well as significant increases in glass and other packaging costs which increased approximately $3 million. Operating expenses for the Specialty Foods Group increased approximately $3.7 million primarily related to increased distribution expenses as a result of higher fuel costs. The Specialty Foods Groups operating expense ratio increased to 10.6% in 2004 compared to 9.9% during the prior year. 33 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 2% to $9.18 billion during 2003 from $8.99 billion in 2002. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales $ Increase/ % Increase/ 2003 2002 (Decrease) (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 7,542.1 $ 7,601.0 $ (58.9 ) (0.8 )% WhiteWave Foods Company 713.4 517.3 196.1 37.9 Specialty Foods Group 684.2 673.6 10.6 1.6 Corporate/ Other 244.9 199.6 45.3 22.7 Total $ 9,184.6 $ 8,991.5 $ 193.1 2.1 % The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2003 vs. 2002 Pricing, Volume Total Foreign and Product Increase/ Acquisitions Divestitures Exchange Mix Changes (Decrease) (In millions) Dairy Group $ 127.3 $ (110.7 ) $ $ (75.5 ) $ (58.9 ) WhiteWave Foods Company 68.8 (3.8 ) 131.1 196.1 Specialty Foods Group (13.7 ) 24.3 10.6 Corporate/ Other 40.3 5.0 45.3 Total $ 196.1 $ (128.2 ) $ 40.3 $ 84.9 $ 193.1 Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers; and costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Our cost of sales ratio was 74.1% in 2003 compared to 73.9% in 2002. Increased raw material costs affected all of our segments in 2003. Also, the WhiteWave Foods Company segment incurred higher costs due to certain manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new products and new technologies, and the realignment of certain manufacturing operations. Operating Costs and Expenses Operating expenses decreased approximately $75.7 million, or 4.5%, in 2003 compared to the prior year. This decrease was mostly due to (1) a gain of $66.2 million on the sale of frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations in the third quarter of 2003, (2) a gain of $2.5 million related to the divestiture of 11 facilities in 2001, which was recorded at corporate as a result of certain contingencies being favorably resolved during 2003, and (3) lower facility closing and other reorganization costs of $11.8 million in 2003 compared to $19.1 million in 2002, primarily due to differences in the nature of the restructuring activities and to the timing of recognition of certain charges as a result of our adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, in January 2003. Our operating expense ratio decreased to 17.6% in 2003 as compared to 18.7% in 2002. Operating Income Operating income during 2003 was $766 million, an increase of $103.4 million, from 2002 operating income of $662.6 million. Our operating margin in 2003 was 8.3% compared to 7.4% in 2002. The operating margin increase was the result of the decline in the operating expense ratio primarily due to the other operating income reported in 2003. Other (Income) Expense Total other (income) expense decreased by $49.4 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest expense decreased to $181.1 million in 2003 from $197.7 million in 2002. This decrease was 34 Table of Contents the result of lower interest rates and lower average debt balances in 2003. Financing charges on preferred securities were $14.2 million in 2003 versus $33.6 million in 2002 due to the conversion of these securities to common stock during the second quarter of 2003. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates was $244,000 in 2003 compared to a loss of $7.9 million in 2002. Income in 2003 was related to our approximately 13% interest in Horizon Organic Holding Corporation. In 2002, we recorded income of $2.1 million, which was primarily related to our 36% interest in White Wave through May 9, 2002, when we acquired the remaining equity interest in White Wave and began consolidating White Waves results with our financial results. This income was offset in 2002 by a $10 million loss on our minority interest in Consolidated Container Company. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.0% in 2003 compared to 36.4% in 2002. In 2002 we recorded the favorable settlement of a contested tax issue. Our tax rate varies as the mix of earnings contributed by our various business units changes. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002 Results by Segment As noted above, we had three reportable segments in 2004: the Dairy Group, the WhiteWave Foods Company and the Specialty Foods Group. Prior periods have been restated to reflect the new segment reporting structure. The key performance indicators of our segments are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Dairy Group Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 7,542.1 100.0 % $ 7,601.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 5,619.4 74.5 5,670.2 74.6 Gross profit 1,922.7 25.5 1,930.8 25.4 Operating costs and expenses 1,281.7 17.0 1,338.3 17.6 Total operating income $ 641.0 8.5 % $ 592.5 7.8 % The Dairy Groups net sales decreased approximately $58.9 million, or 0.8%, in 2003 versus 2002. The change in net sales from 2002 to 2003 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2002 Net sales $ 7,601.0 Acquisitions 127.3 1.7 % Divestitures (110.7 ) (1.5 ) Volume (159.6 ) (2.1 ) Pricing and product mix 84.1 1.1 2003 Net sales $ 7,542.1 (0.8 )% The Dairy Group acquired Kohler Mix Specialties in October 2003 and Melody Farms in June 2003. The Dairy Groups sales declined primarily due to lower sales volumes. Volume change for all products, excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, was a decline of 2.1% in 2003 compared to 2002. That volume change was driven primarily by the fluid dairy and ice cream categories. Equivalent gallons of fluid dairy products sold (including milk and cream) decreased by approximately 1.1% in 2003. We believe the decrease was due primarily to continued declining consumption of traditional fluid dairy products in some 35 Table of Contents parts of the country. Ice cream and ice cream novelty volumes declined by approximately 7% in 2003 compared to 2002, primarily because we sell our ice cream under private labels and local brands, and we believe we lost sales during the year to nationally branded products which were promoted more aggressively than our products. In addition, certain private label products historically sold by the Dairy Group, including sour cream, whipping cream and coffee creamers, were converted to sales of LAND O LAKES products, which are reported in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. Net sales also declined by approximately $110.7 million related to divestitures. We sold our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations in July 2003. In addition, beginning in January 2002, we began exiting from the Lactaid, Nestl Nesquik and Nestl Coffeemate co packing businesses due to the termination of the co packing agreements. Our transition out of the Lactaid co packing business was completed in February 2002 and our transition out of the Nestle co packing business was completed in February 2003. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in pricing. The increase in sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily results from higher raw milk costs in 2003 than in 2002, offset somewhat by price concessions that were granted in some markets due to competitive pressures. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials fluctuate. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2003 compared to 2002: Year Ended December 31* 2003 2002 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1) $ 7.47 (2) $ 7.01 (2) 7 % Class I butterfat mover(1) 1.19 (3) 1.21 (3) (2 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 6.74 (2) 7.62 (2) (12 ) Class II butterfat minimum(4) 1.22 (3) 1.20 (3) 2 * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover prices plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation, and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio remained consistent at 74.5% in 2003 compared to 74.6% in 2002. The Dairy Groups operating expenses decreased approximately $56.6 million to $1.28 billion in 2003 from $1.34 billion in 2002. The decrease in the Dairy Groups operating expenses was primarily due to lower insurance, advertising, bad debt and bonus expenses in 2003. Insurance costs (including the costs of self insurance) declined in 2003 as a result of better claims experience. Advertising expenses decreased in 2003 partially because we reduced planned advertising spending in 2003 in anticipation of the difficult raw milk environment and also because advertising expense in 2002 was higher than normal as we incurred unusual advertising costs in order to (1) promote our brands in certain parts of the country following our acquisition of Legacy Dean, and (2) promote two local Dairy Group brands affected by product recalls in 2002. Bad debt expense declined in 2003 compared to 2002. In 2002, some of our customers experienced economic difficulty and a few large customers sought bankruptcy protection. Bonus expenses were lower in 2003 than in 2002 as a result of our actual performance compared to bonus targets. 36 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Company Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 713.4 100.0 % $ 517.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 468.4 65.7 299.6 57.9 Gross profit 245.0 34.3 217.7 42.1 Operating costs and expenses 211.4 29.6 158.5 30.7 Total operating income $ 33.6 4.7 % $ 59.2 11.4 % WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by $196.1 million, or 37.9%, in 2003 compared to 2002. The change in net sales from 2002 to 2003 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2002 Net sales $ 517.3 Acquisitions 68.8 13.3 % Divestitures (3.8 ) (0.7 ) Volume 106.2 20.5 Pricing and product mix 24.9 4.8 2003 Net sales $ 713.4 37.9 % We acquired the 64% of White Wave that we did not already own in May 2002. Therefore, 2003 includes 12 months of White Wave sales compared to only 8 months in 2002. Unit volumes for WhiteWave Foods Company, excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, increased 20.5% overall in 2003 due to the success of our nationally branded products, particularly Silk. Sales increased due to pricing, product mix and other changes, including price increases for several of our products, such as Hersheys, Maries and LAND OLAKES. These price increases were partly offset by price reductions for International Delight in order to clear shelf space for new plastic packaging that was introduced in the first half of 2003. The cost of sales ratio for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to 65.7% in 2003 compared to 57.9% in 2002 primarily due to the impact of (1) short term manufacturing inefficiencies related to the introduction of new products and new technologies, (2) short term manufacturing inefficiencies due to certain manufacturing realignments related to the shifting of certain manufacturing operations to our Dairy Group Segment, and (3) an additional $15 million of packaging costs due to the introduction of International Delight in plastic packaging. Operating expenses were $211.4 million during 2003 compared to $158.5 million during 2002. This increase was primarily due to higher marketing expenses in 2003 related to the introduction of new products and higher promotional spending on nationally branded products. Operating expenses were also significantly impacted by the addition of White Wave in May 2002, including the accrual of almost $10 million more in 2003 than in 2002 for bonuses paid in March 2004 under the White Wave Performance Bonus Plan that was established when we acquired White Wave. 37 Table of Contents Specialty Foods Group Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 684.2 100.0 % $ 673.6 100.0 % Cost of sales 514.9 75.3 498.1 73.9 Gross profit 169.3 24.7 175.5 26.1 Operating costs and expenses 68.0 9.9 76.6 11.4 Total operating income $ 101.3 14.8 % $ 98.9 14.7 % The Specialty Foods Groups net sales increased by $10.6 million, or 1.6%, in 2003 versus 2002. The change in net sales from 2002 to 2003 was due to the following: Dollars Percentage (Dollars in millions) 2002 Net sales $ 673.6 Divestitures (13.7 ) (2.0 )% Volume 15.9 2.4 Pricing and product mix 8.4 1.2 2003 Net sales $ 684.2 1.6 % The Specialty Foods Group sold EBI Foods, Ltd. in October 2002. Excluding the effects of this divestiture, the Specialty Foods Groups pickle volumes declined 1.6% in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the bankruptcy of a large customer, and to the overall effects of economic difficulties in the foodservice sector as a whole. Approximately 28% of the Specialty Foods Groups sales were to foodservice customers in 2003. This decrease was more than offset by a 12.8% increase in unit volumes of non dairy powdered creamer as a result of new business and a 15.2% increase in unit volumes of nutritional beverages due to increased demand. Pricing was up in all categories primarily due to increased raw material costs that were passed on to customers in the form of higher selling prices. Also, promotional spending that is recorded as a reduction of net sales was down by $15.3 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The Specialty Foods Groups cost of sales ratio increased to 75.3% in 2003 from 73.9% in 2002 as a result of higher raw material prices, especially glass, and increases in natural gas prices. The Specialty Foods Group uses a significant amount of natural gas in its operations. Operating expenses for the Specialty Foods Group declined to $68 million in 2003 compared to $76.6 million in 2002 primarily due to the sale of EBI Foods, Ltd. in October 2002, which had higher operating expenses, and to lower bonus expense. Bonus expenses were $1.3 million less in 2003 as a result of our actual performance compared to bonus targets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow During 2004, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities was $527.7 million for 2004 as contrasted to $522.3 million for 2003, an increase of $5.4 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by: An increase of $79.6 million in net income plus non cash items in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations in 2003 offset by; 38 Table of Contents An increase in our operating working capital of $183.9 in 2004 as compared to $175.6 million in 2003 due primarily to increased raw material costs in 2004; A decrease of $10 million in income taxes payable in 2004 compared to an increase of $27.9 million in 2003 as our 2004 estimated tax payments more closely approximated our tax obligation resulting in a lower tax liability at December 31, 2004; A decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $436,000 in 2004 compared to a decrease of $20.7 million in 2003 primarily due to higher dispositions of net assets held for sale in 2003; and Lower tax savings on equity compensation of $7.9 million due to fewer stock option exercises in 2004 compared to the prior year. Net cash used in investing activities was $746.6 million in 2004 compared to $436.2 million in 2003, an increase of $310.4 million. We used approximately $401.1 million for acquisitions and $356.1 million for capital expenditures in 2004 compared to $246.6 million and $291.7 million in 2003, respectively. We had cash proceeds from the sale of the frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations and one other small business of $90 million in 2003. We used approximately $297 million to repurchase our stock during 2004. Set forth in the chart below is a summary of the stock we repurchased in 2004: No. of Shares of Aggregate Average Common Stock Purchase Purchase Price Period Repurchased Price(1) Per Share (Dollars in millions except per share data) January 2004 150,000 $ 5.2 $ 34.42 August 2004 2,170,000 78.6 36.24 September 2004 5,655,000 173.5 30.69 October 2004 1,335,000 39.7 29.72 9,310,000 $ 297.0 31.90 (1) Includes commissions and fees. We received approximately $67.9 million in 2004 as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. We increased our net borrowings by $438.2 million in 2004 compared to a net borrowing of $27 million in 2003. Current Debt Obligations Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. Both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from 0 to 62.5 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 75 to 187.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 3.72% at December 31, 2004. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged $775 million of our borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 4.96%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. 39 Table of Contents Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows: $56.25 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008; $262.5 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2008 through June 30, 2009; and A final payment of $262.5 million on the maturity date of August 13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility until maturity on August 13, 2009. The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or recovery events. In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving credit facility that ranges from 25 to 37.5 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage and interest coverage ratio. We are currently, and have always been, in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval: (1) the acquired company is involved in the manufacture, processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any other line of business in which we are currently engaged, (2) the net cash purchase price is not greater than $500 million, (3) we acquire at least 51% of the acquired entity, (4) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target and (5) after giving effect to such acquisition on a pro forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of Legacy Deans subsidiaries, and the real property owned by Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries). The credit agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, and certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The credit agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our credit rating. In August 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to (1) increase the size of our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, (2) increase the size of our term loan A from $850 million to $1.5 billion, (3) eliminate term loans B and C and (4) modify the interest rate and payment terms. When we amended our credit facility, we were required to write off approximately $32.6 million of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with our credit facility prior to the amendment. These costs were being amortized over the previous terms of the revolving credit facility and term loans. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding borrowings of $2.03 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $1.78 billion at December 31, 2003), including $1.5 billion in term loan borrowings and $531.1 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2004, there were $129.3 million of letters of credit under the revolving line that were issued but undrawn. As of March 11, 2005, approximately $1.80 billion was outstanding under our senior credit facility. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $500 million receivables backed credit facility, which had $500 million outstanding at December 31, 2004 (compared to $302.5 million at December 31, 2003). At December 31, 2004, there was no remaining availability under this facility. The average interest rate on this facility at December 31, 2004 was 2.83%. In January 2005, we amended our receivables backed loan to increase the facility to $600 million. Approximately $546 million was outstanding under this facility at 40 Table of Contents March 11, 2005. See Notes 9 and 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables backed facility. Our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility and receivables backed credit facility increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily to fund our acquisitions and share repurchases. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2004 included $700 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Legacy Deans senior notes, a $30.8 million line of credit at our Spanish subsidiary and approximately $30.9 million face value of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness, purchase and lease obligations at December 31, 2004.

(2) Primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes, including organic soybeans, organic raw milk and cucumbers. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process. (3) Only includes our fixed rate interest obligations, which consist of our senior notes and our interest rate swap agreements. Other Long Term Liabilities We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As 41 Table of Contents such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. In 2004, we recorded non cash expense of $11 million, of which $9.1 million was attributable to periodic expense and $1.9 million was attributable to settlements compared to a total of $15.3 million in 2003, of which $2.5 million was attributable to settlements. These amounts were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. We decreased the assumed discount rate from a range of 6.0% to 6.5% at December 31, 2003 to 5.75% at December 31, 2004. In selecting assumed rate of return on plan assets, we considered past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan, as well as our investment allocation policy. Plan asset returns were $14.8 million in 2004, a $10.2 million decrease from plan asset returns of $25 million in 2003. Net periodic pension expense for our plans is expected to decrease in 2005 to approximately $10.6 million due primarily to the increase in assets from $151.6 million as of December 31, 2003 to $181 million as of December 31, 2004. Based on current projections, 2005 funding requirements will be approximately $33.7 million as compared to $43.8 million for 2004. Additionally, based on current projections, 2005 funding requirements for our other postretirement benefit obligations will be approximately $1.8 million as compared to $2.8 million in 2004. As a result of lower discount rates at December 31, 2004, we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. The accumulated other comprehensive income component of the additional minimum liability, which totaled $23.3 million ($14.5 million net of tax), was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income, and did not affect net income for 2004. The charge to Other Comprehensive Income will be reversed in future periods to the extent the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. See Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Other Commitments and Contingencies On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments we make under this note, if any, will be expensed as incurred. We also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation, investigations and audits: certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested; certain lease obligations, which require us to guarantee the minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease; and selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations. 42 Table of Contents Future Capital Requirements During 2005, we intend to invest a total of approximately $300 million to $325 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. We intend to spend this amount as follows: Operating Division Amount (In millions) Dairy Group $ 175 to 180 WhiteWave Foods Company 105 to 110 Specialty Foods Group 5 to 10 Other 15 to 25 Total $ 300 to 325 In 2005, we expect cash interest to be approximately $170 million based on current debt levels and cash taxes to be approximately $85 million to $95 million. We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. As of March 11, 2005, approximately $1.08 billion was available for future borrowings under our senior credit facility. Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Milk, Cream and Other Inputs Dairy Group The primary raw material used in our Dairy Group is raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat). The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw milk, and those prices change on a monthly basis. The regulated minimum prices differ based on how the raw milk is utilized. Raw milk processed into fluid milk is priced at the Class I price, and raw milk processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream is priced at the Class II price. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain producer premiums (or over order premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw milk costs, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in our raw milk costs can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices that it charges for Class I dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw milk and other materials fluctuate. Prices for some Class II products are not changed on a monthly basis, but are changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. There can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, especially in the case of Class II butterfat because Class II butterfat prices for each month are not announced by the government until after the end of that month. Also, in some cases we are competitively or contractually constrained with the means and timing of implementing price changes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margin fluctuate with the price of our raw materials and other inputs. In 2004, our Dairy Group was adversely affected by extreme volatility in the prices of raw skim milk and butterfat. In 2005, we expect prices to be somewhat less volatile and lower than the average price in 2004. Of course raw milk prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. If raw milk prices do remain at or near current levels throughout 2005, we would expect our sales for 2005 to be less than in 2004 because, in general, we change the prices of our products to reflect changes in raw material prices. Because our Class II products typically have a higher fat content than that contained in raw milk, we also purchase bulk cream for use in some of our Class II products. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a 43 Table of Contents multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The prices of AA butter started rising by moderate amounts in late 2003, and then increased significantly in 2004. They remained high throughout 2004 and we expect the average price to be somewhat lower in 2005 than the average price in 2004. Of course, like raw milk prices, bulk cream prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. We try to change our prices based on changes in the price of bulk cream, but sometimes we are competitively or contractually constrained. Therefore, increases in bulk cream prices can have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Prices for resin, which is used in plastic milk bottles, are also extremely high and are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Finally, the Dairy Group uses a great deal of diesel fuel in its direct store delivery system, and diesel fuel prices are currently very high and expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. High or volatile fuel and resin costs can adversely affect the Dairy Groups profitability. WhiteWave Foods Company A significant raw material used to manufacture products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company is organic soybeans. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs for 2005. Generally, these agreements provide for pricing at fixed levels. However, should our need for organic soybeans exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we would be required to pay would likely be significantly higher. The increase in soymilk consumption combined with the increased demand for organic cattle feed has put pressure on the supply of organic soybeans and there is significant upward pressure on organic soybean prices. We believe prices for organic soybeans will continue to increase as the pressure on supply continues. Another significant raw material used in our organic products is organic raw milk. Organic raw milk is not readily available and the growth of our organic dairy business depends on us being able to procure sufficient quantities of organic raw milk in time to meet our needs. We obtain our supply of organic raw milk by entering into one to two year agreements with farmers pursuant to which the farmers agree to sell us specified quantities of organic raw milk for fixed prices for the duration of the agreement We believe, based on currently projected sales levels, that we have secured a sufficient supply of raw organic milk to meet our raw organic milk needs for the remainder of 2005. However, should our need for organic raw milk exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we would be required to pay, if we could obtain supply at all, would likely be significantly higher. Also, as our contracts with farmers expire, we are generally required to agree to higher prices to renew as a result of increased competition for organic raw milk supply. For competitive reasons, WhiteWave Foods Company is not able to pass along price increases to customers as quickly as the Dairy Group. Specialty Foods Group Many of the raw materials used by our Specialty Foods Group also rose to unusually high levels during 2004, including soybean oil, casein, cheese and packaging materials. High fuel costs have also had a negative impact on the Specialty Foods Groups results. Prices for many of these raw materials and packaging materials used by the Specialty Foods Group are expected to remain high and in some cases increase in 2005. For competitive reasons, the Specialty Foods Group is not able to pass along increases in raw material and other input costs as quickly as the Dairy Group. Therefore, the current raw material environment is expected to continue to adversely affect the Specialty Foods Groups financial results in 2005. Competitive Environment There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery industry in recent years, and this trend is continuing. As our customer base consolidates, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers, or gain new customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. 44 Table of Contents Many of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current intensely competitive environment. Over the past few years, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group and Specialty Foods Group segments, which reduced our profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend to continue. In bidding situations we are subject to the risk of losing certain customers altogether. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have contracts with many of our largest customers, and most of the contracts that we do have are generally terminable at will by the customer. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail level have caused competition to become increasingly intense at the processor level. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Tax Rate Our 2004 tax rate was 38.3%. We estimate the effective tax for 2005 to be slightly less than 38%. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as recent and proposed changes to federal and state tax codes may cause the rate to change from historical rates. See Risk Factors for a description of various other risks and uncertainties concerning our business. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Accounts Receivable We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. As these factors change, our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $24.2 million, or approximately 3% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004. The allowance for doubtful accounts, expressed as a percent of accounts receivable, was approximately 4% at December 31, 2003. Each 0.10% change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately $880,000. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $4.14 billion as of December 31, 2004 resulting primarily from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. We believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support. Perpetual trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual trademark is impaired if its book value 45 Table of Contents exceeds fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value. A reporting unit can be a segment or an operating division. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual trademarks or goodwill during 2004. Purchase Price Allocation We allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. All identifiable assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company, normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements. As final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation. To the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed including quoted market prices, forecast of expected cash flows, net realizable values, estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period, which could have an impact on our earnings. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our valuation allowance increased $1.2 million in 2004 due to the increased likelihood that state net operating losses will expire before they are used. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $146.1 million and $136.3 million, respectively, including both current and long term liabilities. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits to our employees including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual 46 Table of Contents basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. In 2004, we consolidated substantially all of our qualified pension plans into one master trust. We retained investment consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to help our Investment Committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust. Our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at 65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. At December 31, 2004, our master trust was invested as follows: equity securities and limited partnerships 74%; fixed income securities 25%; and cash and cash equivalents 1%. We determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plans investments based on target allocations of the pension plans investments. Additionally, we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plans investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other investments. The resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.5%. While a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature, including assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and mortality rates, generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions. As such, our discount rate likely will change more frequently. In 2004 we reduced the discount rate utilized to determine our estimated future benefit obligations from a range of 6.0% to 6.5% at December 31, 2003 to 5.75% at December 31, 2004. A 0.25% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $412,000 and $489,000, respectively. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $184,000. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits in an attempt to improve financial statement disclosures regarding defined benefit plans. This standard requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and other relevant information. In addition to expanded annual disclosures, we are required to report the various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit costs on a quarterly basis. SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003) is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003, and for quarters beginning after December 15, 2003. The expanded disclosure requirements are included in this report. On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Part D, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In April 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 106 2 to address the accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Act. The FSP is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after September 15, 2004. Substantially all of our postretirement benefits terminate at age 65. Therefore, the FSP will have no material affect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in December 2004. It will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant date fair values. That cost will be recognized over the vesting period. SFAS No. 123(R) will become effective for us in the third quarter 2005. We are still evaluating the impact of 47 Table of Contents SFAS No. 123(R) on our Consolidated Financial Statements and have not yet determined the transition method we will apply when we adopt the statement. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Based Compensation for illustrations of the pro forma impact of expensing our stock options in the historical periods. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151, which is effective for inventory costs incurred during years beginning after June 15, 2005, clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the rule in APB No. 29 which excluded from fair value measurement exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead, SFAS No. 153 excludes from fair value measurement exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. Reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company Segment Could Temporarily Adversely Affect the Performance of the Segment In the third quarter of 2004, we began the process of consolidating the operations of the three operating units that comprise our WhiteWave Foods Company segment into a single business. We have completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization for the three companies, and in the third quarter of 2005, the employees of the new company will move to a new headquarters located in Broomfield, Colorado. The full integration of these businesses will be a lengthy process involving all aspects of the three companys operations, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and administration, and will include the selection and implementation of a new information technology platform. As part of our overall reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company into a unified branded consumer packaged goods company, we also intend to bring in house certain manufacturing activities that are currently being done by third parties. We expect the consolidation to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. This process presents a number of challenges and requires a significant amount of managements attention. Our failure to successfully manage this process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, effective March 11, 2005, Mr. Steve Demos, President of WhiteWave Foods Company resigned his position. We have retained a leading executive recruiting firm to assist in the search for a new president. Mr. Gregg Engles, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, has assumed direct leadership of WhiteWave Foods Company on an interim basis. This transition could be disruptive to us in the short term. 48 Table of Contents Spin Off of our Specialty Foods Group In January 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. Separating the Specialty Foods Group segment from our business, and completing the successful spin off will require a number of operational, legal and regulatory steps be successfully completed. Completing these steps presents a number of challenges and will require a significant amount of managements attention. Our failure to successfully manage the process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales. In addition, the spin off is dependent upon the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on the tax free nature of the transaction. If we fail to receive a favorable letter ruling, the spin off will not occur. Recent Financial Difficulty at Specialty Foods Group Segment Could Continue Longer Than We Expect Our Specialty Foods Group segment experienced financial difficulty during 2004 due primarily to rising input costs and to a decline in demand for Specialty Foods Groups line of nutritional beverages. We exited the nutritional beverages business at the end of 2004. Also, the former President of the Specialty Foods Group segment returned to run the business in late October. With these changes and certain other changes we are implementing at the Specialty Foods Group, it is our goal to return the Specialty Foods Group segment to its historical levels of profitability in 2005. However, there can be no assurance as to how long it will take to return the Specialty Foods Group to its historical levels of profitability, if ever. Many factors are beyond our control, such as the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies and competitive pressures that limit our ability to raise prices in reaction to increased input costs. Recent Successes of Our Products Could Attract Increased Competitive Activity, Which Could Impede Our Growth Rate and Cost Us Sales and, in the Case of Organic Products, Put Pressure on the Availability of Raw Materials Our Silk soymilk and Horizon Organic organic food and beverage products have leading market shares in their categories and have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories. As soy and organic products continue to gain in popularity with consumers, we expect our products in these categories to continue to attract competitors. Many large food and beverage companies have substantially more resources than we do and they may be able to market their soy and organic products more successfully than us, which could cause our growth rate in these categories to be slower than our forecast and could cause us to lose sales. The increase in popularity of soy and organic milks is also attracting private label competitors who sell their products at a lower price. The success of private label brands could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Finally, there is a limited supply of organic raw materials in the United States, especially organic soybeans and organic raw milk. New entrants into our markets can reduce available supply and drive up costs. Even without new entrants, our own rapid growth can put pressure on the availability and price of organic raw materials. Our International Delight coffee creamer competes intensely with Nestl CoffeeMate business, and our Hersheys milks and milkshakes compete intensely with Nestl Nesquik. Nestle has significantly greater resources than we do, which allows them to promote their products more aggressively. Our failure to successfully compete with Nestle could have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of our International Delight and or our Hersheys businesses. Loss of Rights to Any of Our Licensed Brands Could Adversely Affect Our Sales and Profits We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Borden, Hersheys, LAND OLAKES, Pet and others. In some cases, we have invested significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents We Have Substantial Debt and Other Financial Obligations and We May Incur Even More Debt We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. The interest rate on our debt is based on our debt rating, as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. We have no ability to control the ratings issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. A downgrade in our debt rating could cause our interest rate to increase, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our targeted profitability level, as well as our cash flow. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our net income. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities, we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations. We intend to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group. Our Specialty Foods Group generates positive cash flow from operations. The loss of income from the Specialty Foods Group will cause compliance with our debt covenant ratios to become more difficult. We intend to pay down some of our debt in 2005 to offset the effect of the Specialty Foods Group spin off on our ratios; however, there can be no assurance that we will successfully pay down our debt. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2004: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 $ 400 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 375 The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2003: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 1.48% to 6.69% December 2004 $ 650 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 400 6.78% December 2006 75 50 Table of Contents We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $20.7 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2004 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. During 2004, we recognized losses of $2.5 million, net of tax, related to our butterfat hedging activities. 51 Table of Contents

Actual performance or results may differ materially and adversely. Reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company Segment Could Temporarily Adversely Affect the Performance of the Segment In the third quarter of 2004, we began the process of consolidating the operations of the three operating units that comprise our WhiteWave Foods Company segment into a single business. We have completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization for the three companies, and in the third quarter of 2005, the employees of the new company will move to a new headquarters located in Broomfield, Colorado. The full integration of these businesses will be a lengthy process involving all aspects of the three companys operations, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution and administration, and will include the selection and implementation of a new information technology platform. As part of our overall reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company into a unified branded consumer packaged goods company, we also intend to bring in house certain manufacturing activities that are currently being done by third parties. We expect the consolidation to be completed in the next 12 to 18 months. This process presents a number of challenges and requires a significant amount of managements attention. Our failure to successfully manage this process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, effective March 11, 2005, Mr. Steve Demos, President of WhiteWave Foods Company resigned his position. We have retained a leading executive recruiting firm to assist in the search for a new president. Mr. Gregg Engles, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, has assumed direct leadership of WhiteWave Foods Company on an interim basis. This transition could be disruptive to us in the short term. 48 Table of Contents Spin Off of our Specialty Foods Group In January 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. Separating the Specialty Foods Group segment from our business, and completing the successful spin off will require a number of operational, legal and regulatory steps be successfully completed. Completing these steps presents a number of challenges and will require a significant amount of managements attention. Our failure to successfully manage the process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales. In addition, the spin off is dependent upon the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on the tax free nature of the transaction. If we fail to receive a favorable letter ruling, the spin off will not occur. Recent Financial Difficulty at Specialty Foods Group Segment Could Continue Longer Than We Expect Our Specialty Foods Group segment experienced financial difficulty during 2004 due primarily to rising input costs and to a decline in demand for Specialty Foods Groups line of nutritional beverages. We exited the nutritional beverages business at the end of 2004. Also, the former President of the Specialty Foods Group segment returned to run the business in late October. With these changes and certain other changes we are implementing at the Specialty Foods Group, it is our goal to return the Specialty Foods Group segment to its historical levels of profitability in 2005. However, there can be no assurance as to how long it will take to return the Specialty Foods Group to its historical levels of profitability, if ever. Many factors are beyond our control, such as the costs of raw materials and packaging supplies and competitive pressures that limit our ability to raise prices in reaction to increased input costs. Recent Successes of Our Products Could Attract Increased Competitive Activity, Which Could Impede Our Growth Rate and Cost Us Sales and, in the Case of Organic Products, Put Pressure on the Availability of Raw Materials Our Silk soymilk and Horizon Organic organic food and beverage products have leading market shares in their categories and have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories. As soy and organic products continue to gain in popularity with consumers, we expect our products in these categories to continue to attract competitors. Many large food and beverage companies have substantially more resources than we do and they may be able to market their soy and organic products more successfully than us, which could cause our growth rate in these categories to be slower than our forecast and could cause us to lose sales. The increase in popularity of soy and organic milks is also attracting private label competitors who sell their products at a lower price. The success of private label brands could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Finally, there is a limited supply of organic raw materials in the United States, especially organic soybeans and organic raw milk. New entrants into our markets can reduce available supply and drive up costs. Even without new entrants, our own rapid growth can put pressure on the availability and price of organic raw materials. Our International Delight coffee creamer competes intensely with Nestl CoffeeMate business, and our Hersheys milks and milkshakes compete intensely with Nestl Nesquik. Nestle has significantly greater resources than we do, which allows them to promote their products more aggressively. Our failure to successfully compete with Nestle could have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of our International Delight and or our Hersheys businesses. Loss of Rights to Any of Our Licensed Brands Could Adversely Affect Our Sales and Profits We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Borden, Hersheys, LAND OLAKES, Pet and others. In some cases, we have invested significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents We Have Substantial Debt and Other Financial Obligations and We May Incur Even More Debt We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. The interest rate on our debt is based on our debt rating, as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. We have no ability to control the ratings issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. A downgrade in our debt rating could cause our interest rate to increase, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our targeted profitability level, as well as our cash flow. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our net income. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities, we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations. We intend to pursue a tax free spin off of our Specialty Foods Group. Our Specialty Foods Group generates positive cash flow from operations. The loss of income from the Specialty Foods Group will cause compliance with our debt covenant ratios to become more difficult. We intend to pay down some of our debt in 2005 to offset the effect of the Specialty Foods Group spin off on our ratios; however, there can be no assurance that we will successfully pay down our debt. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. These swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2004: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 $ 400 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 375 The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2003: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 1.48% to 6.69% December 2004 $ 650 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 400 6.78% December 2006 75 50 Table of Contents We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $20.7 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2004 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. During 2004, we recognized losses of $2.5 million, net of tax, related to our butterfat hedging activities. 51 Table of Contents
