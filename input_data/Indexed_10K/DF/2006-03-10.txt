Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs. Other raw materials used by the Dairy Group, such as juice concentrates and sweeteners, in addition to packaging supplies, are generally available from numerous suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of our Dairy Groups raw materials and packaging supplies are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of our raw materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand. The Dairy Group generally increases or decreases the prices of its fluid dairy products on a monthly basis in correlation to fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, packaging supplies and delivery costs. However, in some cases, we are competitively or contractually constrained with respect to the means and or timing of price increases. This can have a negative impact on the Dairy Groups profitability. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. From 1990 through 2001, the dairy industry experienced significant consolidation, led by us. Consolidation has resulted in lower operating costs, less excess capacity and greater efficiency. However, per capita consumption of traditional fluid dairy products has continued to decline. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 15% from 1990 to the end of 2004, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic, and due to the significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. For more financial information about our Dairy Groups recent operations, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. WhiteWave Foods Company WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers and LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells The Organic Cow organic dairy products; White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu and Hersheys milks and milkshakes. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Companys sales totaled approximately $1.14 billion in 2005, or approximately 11% of our consolidated sales. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including 3 Table of Contents grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. The following charts graphically depict WhiteWave Foods Companys sales by brand and by channel: (1) Other brands include Hersheys milk and milk shakes, The Organic Cow organic dairy products and White Wave and Tofu Town tofu. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products including sales to its largest customer (Wal Mart including its subsidiaries, such as Sams Club, which accounted for approximately 14.4% of WhiteWave Foods Companys 2005 sales) are sold pursuant to customer purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. In 2005, approximately 70% of the products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company were manufactured in facilities operated by either WhiteWave Foods Company or our Dairy Group. The remaining 30% were manufactured by third party manufacturers under processing agreements. WhiteWave Foods Company currently operates seven manufacturing facilities, including three facilities that were previously operated by our Dairy Group. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products are delivered by common carrier to customer warehouses, although some products are distributed through third party distributors or through our Dairy Groups DSD system. The primary raw materials used in our soy based products are organic soybeans and organic soybean concentrate. Organic soybeans are generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these products. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs in 2006. Generally, these agreements provide pricing at fixed levels. The primary raw material used in our organic milk based products is organic raw milk. We currently purchase organic raw milk from a network of over 325 dairy farmers across the United States. We also produce certain of our own organic raw milk needs in the U.S. at two organic farms that we own and operate. However, the demand for organic raw milk exceeds the supply available. As a result, at times we are forced to limit quantities we ship to our customers. We are currently taking steps to increase the supply of organic raw milk available to us; however, there can be no assurance as to when supply will fully meet demand because the process of converting a farm from conventional production to organic production takes three years. The growth of our organic dairy business will depend on us being able to obtain sufficient quantities of organic raw milk. We expect to continue to limit quantities available to customers of organic milk into the second quarter of 2006. We generally enter into supply agreements with dairy farmers with typical terms of one to two years, which obligate us to purchase certain minimum quantities. The primary raw material used in our LAND OLAKES and other non organic dairy products is raw milk. We purchase raw milk from farmers cooperatives, typically pursuant to requirements contracts (with no minimum purchase obligation). Raw milk is generally readily available. The minimum price of raw milk is regulated in most parts of the country by the federal government. Several states also regulate raw milk pricing through their own programs. Other raw materials used in WhiteWave Foods Companys products, such as flavorings, organic sugar and packaging materials, are generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of these raw materials are purchased under contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of raw materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand. For more information, see Part II Item 7. 4 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Effective January 1, 2006, Rachels Organic was consolidated with our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. For more information about WhiteWave Foods Company, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. International Group Our International Group manufactures, markets and sells private label and branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. We also own Rachels Organic, which markets and sells organic dairy products across the United Kingdom under the brand names Rachels Organic and Divine Rice. The International Groups sales totaled $399.8 million in 2005, or approximately 4% of our consolidated sales. The following charts graphically depict the International Groups 2005 sales by product category and channel, and indicate the percentage of private label sales versus company branded sales in 2005. (1) Our International Groups largest customers in 2005 were Carrefour, S.A., and J. Sainsbury, which accounted for approximately 22.0% and 10.7% of the International Groups 2005 sales, respectively. (2) Including our proprietary Celta, Campobueno, La Vaquera Milsani and Rachels Organic brands. Our International Group manufactures its products in five facilities in Spain and Portugal. Rachels Organic has one manufacturing facility located in Aberystwth, United Kingdom which was moved to the WhiteWave Foods Company segment effective January 1, 2006. For more information about our International Group facilities, see Item 2. Properties. Our International Group operates its business primarily from its headquarters located in Pontedeume, Galicia, Spain. The long shelf life of our International Groups fluid milk products allows delivery by common carrier. Most of the International Groups customers purchase our products either by purchase order or by contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. Our International Groups sales are slightly seasonal, with sales tending to be lower in the third quarter. The primary raw material used by our International Group is raw milk. We purchase our raw milk from farmers cooperatives and other intermediaries pursuant to formal and informal contractual arrangements. 5 Table of Contents Raw milk production volume is regulated by European Union quotas, which sometimes limit the availability of raw milk to processors. The price of raw milk is defined solely by supply and demand and can fluctuate widely. Our International Group purchases its packaging materials from two leading suppliers. Packaging materials represent a significant portion of our International Groups raw material costs and are purchased under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The Iberian fluid dairy market, which includes Spain and Portugal, is characterized by relatively high per capita consumption and long shelf life brick pack products dominate the industry. The combination of these factors makes the Iberian region one of the largest long shelf life markets in the world. The Iberian fluid dairy market has been characterized over the past 20 years by slow growth in the core products and faster growth for value added products such as nutritionally enriched milks. The Iberian fluid dairy industry is highly competitive, with leading companies investing heavily in innovation and branding. The industry has undergone significant consolidation in the past 5 to 10 years leading to the emergence of several national brands, including our Celta brand. Our International Group competes with all the leading fluid dairy processors operating in the Iberian region. Competition between dairy processors for private label business has intensified recently as a result of retailer consolidation, and is based primarily on price, service and quality. Competition for branded sales to consumers is based on a number of factors, including brand recognition, price and quality. Current Business Strategy Maximize Dairy Group Performance As the largest dairy processor in the United States, our Dairy Group is in a unique position to provide unmatched service, convenience and value to our customers. We are intently focused on maintaining and extending our Dairy Groups leadership position by focusing on our customers needs. In 2005, our Dairy Groups fresh milk volumes were up by 2.5% while total U.S. consumption was generally flat, according to data published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We believe this increase in market share is an indication of the success of our strategy. In 2006, we are focused on maintaining and growing our Dairy Groups sales volume by continuing to provide our customers with the highest level of service, quality and value. Also in 2006, we intend to begin a multi year project designed to extend the competitive advantage of our Dairy Group by further reducing our cost structure, primarily through rationalizing our purchasing and administrative functions and by investing in a new, more efficient information technology platform. Maximize the Performance of WhiteWave Foods Company In 2004, we began the process of consolidating the operations of the three operating units that comprise our WhiteWave Foods Company segment into a single business. We are building a vertically integrated branded business with a focused product portfolio, efficient manufacturing processes and an optimal distribution system. During 2005, we appointed a new President of our business, which was a key step in the development of a consolidated leadership team for the organization. We also completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization and the supply chain integration is in process. We consolidated most product manufacturing into five primary facilities, three of which were transferred from our Dairy Group in 2005, and we narrowed our network of co packers. In 2006, we will continue to focus on streamlining our product portfolio, focusing on the most profitable opportunities, and on continuing to maximize our production and distribution processes. We are currently in the initial stages of implementing the SAP platform across WhiteWave Foods Company, which we expect will enable us to more effectively and efficiently manage our supply chain and business processes. Invest in the Growth and Profitability of our Brands In 2006, we intend to continue to invest in aggressively marketing our WhiteWave Foods Company brands, with an emphasis on our largest and most successful brands: Silk, Horizon Organic, International 6 Table of Contents Delight and LAND OLAKES. We will continue to make capital expenditures allowing us to increase internal manufacturing, which we believe will allow us to better manage our working capital and increase profitability. In order to meet the growth in demand for our organic dairy products we will continue to expand our network of dairy farmers, as well as increase our organic farming operations, as necessary. Developments Since January 1, 2005 Discontinued Operations On June 27, 2005, we completed the spin off (Spin off) of our indirect, majority owned subsidiary TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (TreeHouse). Immediately prior to the Spin off, we transferred to TreeHouse (1) the businesses previously conducted by our Specialty Foods Group segment, (2) the Mocha Mix and Second Nature businesses previously conducted by WhiteWave Foods Company, and (3) the foodservice salad dressings businesses previously conducted by the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company. The Spin off was effected by means of a share dividend of the TreeHouse common stock held by us to our stockholders of record on June 20, 2005 (the Record Date). In the distribution, our stockholders received one share of TreeHouse common stock for every five shares of our common stock held by them on the Record Date. On August 22, 2005, we completed the sale of certain tangible and intangible assets related to the production and distribution of Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips. We also licensed the Dean trademark to Ventura Foods for use on certain non dairy dips. The sales price was approximately $194 million. Both the TreeHouse Spin off and the Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips transactions were part of our strategy to focus on our core dairy and branded businesses. Prior periods have been revised to remove the results of our former Specialty Foods Group segment and Mocha Mix, Second Nature and private label dressings businesses and our Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips businesses, which have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Management Changes On August 25, 2005, we announced that we had selected Joseph E. Scalzo to serve as President and CEO of WhiteWave Foods Company. Mr. Scalzo, most recently Group President, Personal Care and Global Value Chain of the Gillette Company, joined WhiteWave Foods Company on October 11, 2005. On September 7, 2005, we announced the succession plan for the President of our Dairy Group. Alan Bernon, the former Chief Operating Officer of the Northeast region of our Dairy Group, succeeded Pete Schenkel effective January 1, 2006. Mr. Schenkel became Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors effective January 1, 2006 and he will assist in the transition of leadership of the Dairy Group through the end of 2007. On October 14, 2005, we announced that Barry Fromberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will resign from his position on April 1, 2006. We are currently conducting a search for Mr. Frombergs successor. Stock Repurchases Between July 1 and December 31, 2005, we spent approximately $699.5 million to repurchase 18.9 million shares of our common stock for an average price of $37.05 per share, excluding commissions and fees. On August 10, 2005, and again on November 2, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized increases in our stock repurchase program in the aggregate amount of $600 million. Between January 1, 2006 and March 6, 2006 we spent approximately $15.3 million to purchase an additional 400,000 shares of our common stock for an average price of $38.37, excluding commissions and fees. At March 6, 2006, approximately $3.2 million remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities In 2005, we recorded a charge of $38.6 million as part of our ongoing costs savings initiative. The Dairy Group recorded a charge of $25.3 million, which included the closing of two facilities in 2005; we are consolidating the production from these facilities into other Dairy Group facilities. Also in 2005, we made 7 Table of Contents significant progress toward the consolidation and optimization of our WhiteWave Foods Company subsidiary. Specifically, we consolidated WhiteWave Foods Companys sales, marketing and research and development functions which resulted in a charge of $10.2 million related to these activities. Also in 2005, we began a project to reorganize our International Group operations in response to a difficult operating environment including eliminating and consolidating certain management, sales and purchasing functions which resulted in a charge of $3.1 million related to these activities. We expect to incur additional charges related to all of these restructuring plans of approximately $7.1 million, primarily in 2006. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities, including termination of certain contractual agreements; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our facility closing and reorganization activities. Amendment to Credit Facility In May 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to lower the interest rate on the revolving credit facility and term loan. With the amendment, both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from zero to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). On November 18, 2005, we again amended our senior credit facility to change the maximum leverage covenant to 4.35 to 1.00 through March 31, 2007, and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter. Debt Securities On December 14, 2005, we filed an immediately effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we registered debt securities that we may issue in the future. If and when the debt securities are issued, they will be unsecured obligations and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. Employees As of December 31, 2005, we had the following employees: No. of % of Employees Total Dairy Group 25,470 94 % WhiteWave Foods Company 935 3 International Group 485 2 Corporate 140 1 Total 27,030 100 % 8 Table of Contents Approximately 37% of the Dairy Groups and 18% of WhiteWave Foods Companys employees participate in collective bargaining agreements. Government Regulation Public Health As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated there under by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued there under, which authorize regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe our facilities and manufacturing practices comply with all material government regulations. Employee Safety Regulations We are subject to certain safety regulations including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations. Environmental Regulations We are subject to various environmental regulations. Ammonia, a refrigerant used extensively in our operations, is considered an extremely hazardous substance pursuant to U.S. federal environmental laws due to its toxicity. Also, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels permitted under local regulations. As a result, certain of our subsidiaries are required to pay wastewater surcharges or to construct wastewater pretreatment facilities. To date, such wastewater surcharges have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain above ground or underground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. These tanks are periodically inspected to determine compliance with applicable regulations. We are required to make expenditures from time to time in order to maintain compliance of these tanks. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, we recognized a liability of $2.8 million as of December 31, 2005, representing the estimated future cost of removing certain underground fuel storage tanks. As we generally have ceased construction of new underground fuel storage tanks, we do not anticipate the impact of this Interpretation to be material in future periods. 9 Table of Contents We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect environmental compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. Milk Industry Regulation The federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in federally regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk contains primarily raw skim milk, in addition to a small percentage of butterfat. The federal government establishes separate minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested to determine the percentage of butterfat, and we pay our suppliers separate prices for the raw skim milk and butterfat based on the results of these tests. The federal governments minimum prices are calculated by economic formula based on supply and demand and vary depending on the processors geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured using the raw product. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for butterfat and raw skim milk that is processed into milk) and Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw skim milk that is processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams, creamers, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government by the 23rd day of the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices for each month are announced on or before the fifth day after the end of that month. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. A few states also have retail pricing requirements. In Spain, the government has established a quota system regulating the amount of milk that can be sold by individual farmers and farm cooperatives, which affects the prices we pay for raw milk. Organic Regulations Our organic products are required to meet the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. These regulations require strict methods of production for organic food products and limit the ability of food processors to use non organic or synthetic materials in the production of organic foods or in the raising of organic livestock. Brief History We commenced operations in 1988 through a predecessor entity. Our original operations consisted solely of a packaged ice business. Since then the following activity has occurred: December 1993 Acquired Suiza Dairy Corporation, a regional dairy processor located in Puerto Rico. We then began acquiring other local and regional U.S. dairy processors, growing our dairy business rapidly primarily through acquisitions. April 1996 Completed our initial public offering under our former name Suiza Foods Corporation and began trading on NASDAQ National Market. January 1997 Completed a secondary offering. March 1997 Began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. August 1997 Acquired Franklin Plastics, Inc., a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling plastic containers. After the acquisition, we began acquiring other companies in the plastic packaging industry. 10 Table of Contents November 1997 Acquired Morningstar Foods Inc., whose business was a predecessor to our WhiteWave Foods Company. This was our first acquisition of a company with national brands. April 1998 Sold our packaged ice operations. May 1998 Acquired Continental Can Company, making us one of the largest plastic packaging companies in the United States. July 1999 Sold all of our U.S. plastic packaging operations to Consolidated Container Company in exchange for cash and a minority interest in the purchaser. January 2000 Acquired Southern Foods Group, L.P., the third largest dairy processor in the United States, making us the largest dairy processor in the country. February 2000 Acquired Leche Celta, one of the largest dairy processors in Spain. March and May 2000 Sold our European packaging operations. December 2001 Acquired Dean Foods Company (Legacy Dean) and changed our name from Suiza Foods Corporation to Dean Foods Company. Legacy Dean changed its name to Dean Holding Company. May 2002 Acquired the portion of White Wave, Inc. that we did not already own. January 2004 Acquired the portion of Horizon Organic that we did not already own. 2005 Consolidated our nationally branded business, including White Wave, Horizon Organic and Dean National Brand Group into a single operating unit called WhiteWave Foods Company. June 2005 Spun off our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. Minority Holdings We own an approximately 25% interest, on a fully diluted basis, in Consolidated Container Company (CCC), one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. We have owned a minority interest in CCC since July 1999 when we sold our U.S. plastic packaging operations to CCC. Vestar Capital Partners controls CCC through a majority ownership interest. Less than 1% of CCC is owned indirectly by Alan Bernon, President of our Dairy Group and a member of our Board of Directors, and his brother Peter Bernon. Pursuant to our agreements with Vestar, we control two of the eight seats on CCCs Management Committee. We also have entered into various supply agreements with CCC pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase certain of our requirements for plastic bottles and bottle components from CCC. In 2005, we spent approximately $324.1 million on products purchased from CCC. Because CCC has issued certain senior notes, CCC files annual, quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about CCC can be found on its website at www.cccllc.com or in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our investment in CCC. Where You Can Get More Information Our fiscal year ends on December 31.

Reorganization of Our WhiteWave Foods Company Segment Could Temporarily Adversely Affect the Performance of the Segment In 2004, we began the process of consolidating the operations of the three operating units that comprise our WhiteWave Foods Company segment into a single business. We are building a vertically integrated branded business with a focused product portfolio, efficient manufacturing processes and an optimal distribution system. During 2005, we appointed a new President of our business, which was a key step in the development of a consolidated leadership team for the organization. We also completed the consolidation of 12 Table of Contents the sales, marketing and research and development organization and the supply chain integration is in process. We consolidated most product manufacturing into five primary facilities, three of which were transferred from our Dairy Group in 2005, and we narrowed our network of co packers. In 2006, we will continue to focus on streamlining our product portfolio, focusing on the most profitable opportunities, and on continuing to maximize our production and distribution processes. We are currently in the initial stages of implementing the SAP platform across the WhiteWave Foods Company, which we expect will enable us to more effectively and efficiently manage our supply chain and business processes. Our failure to successfully manage this process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Recent Successes of Our Products Could Attract Increased Competitive Activity, Which Could Impede Our Growth Rate and Cost Us Sales and, in the Case of Organic Products, Put Pressure on the Availability of Raw Materials Our Silk soymilk and Horizon Organic organic food and beverage products have leading market shares in their categories and have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories. As soy and organic products continue to gain in popularity with consumers, we expect our products in these categories to continue to attract competitors. Many large food and beverage companies have substantially more resources than we do and they may be able to market their soy and organic products more successfully than us, which could cause our growth rate in these categories to be slower than our forecast and could cause us to lose sales. The increase in popularity of soy and organic milks is also attracting private label competitors who sell their products at a lower price. The success of private label brands could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Finally, there is a limited supply of organic raw materials in the United States, especially organic soybeans and organic raw milk. New entrants into our markets can reduce available supply and drive up costs. Even without new entrants, our own growth can put pressure on the availability and price of organic raw materials. Our International Delight coffee creamer competes intensely with Nestl CoffeeMate business, and our Hersheys milks and milkshakes compete intensely with Nestl Nesquik. Nestle has significantly greater resources than we do, which allows them to promote their products more aggressively. Our failure to successfully compete with Nestle could have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of our International Delight and or our Hersheys businesses. Changes in Laws, Regulations and Accounting Standards Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Financial Results We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and numerous related regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in federal, state or local laws, or the interpretations of such laws and regulations may negatively impact our financial results or our ability to market our products. Loss of Rights to Any of Our Licensed Brands Could Adversely Affect Our Sales and Profits We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Borden, Hersheys, LAND OLAKES, Pet, and others. In some cases, we have invested significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We Have Substantial Debt and Other Financial Obligations and We May Incur Even More Debt We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See Part II Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. 13 Table of Contents We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our high debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. The interest rate on our debt is based on our debt rating, as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. We have no ability to control the ratings issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. A downgrade in our debt rating could cause our interest rate to increase, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our targeted profitability level, as well as our cash flow. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our net income. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities, we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations.

The net effect was to decrease net sales by $33.7 million in 2001. There was no impact on our net income as a result of the adoption of this issue. (2) On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires, among other things, that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized and that recognized intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective useful lives. As required by SFAS No. 142, our results for periods prior to 2002 have not been restated. (3) Results for 2004 include a gain of $5.9 million primarily related to the settlement of litigation. Results for 2003 include a gain of $66.2 million on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations and a gain of $2.5 million related to the divestiture of the 11 facilities in 2001 in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean. Results for 2001 include a gain of $47.5 million on the divestiture of 11 facilities offset by an expense of $28.5 million resulting from a payment to a supplier as consideration for modifications to an agreement and an impairment charge of $1.7 million on a water plant. (4) Results for 2004 include a charge of $32.6 million to write off deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility. Results for 2001 and 2000 have been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections. Gains and losses that were previously recorded as extraordinary items related to the early extinguishment of debt, which were a $7.3 million loss in 2001 and a $7.7 million gain in 2000, have been reclassified to interest expense. There was no effect on net income. (5) In December 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean, we purchased Dairy Farmers of Americas 33.8% interest in our Dairy Group. (6) In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. If FIN 47 had always been in effect, we would have expensed this amount for depreciation in periods prior to January 1, 2005. (7) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends, earnings represents income before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest on all debt, amortization of deferred financing costs and the portion of rental expense that we believe is representative of the interest component of rent expense. (8) Includes amounts outstanding under subsidiary lines of credit and the current portion of long term debt. 22 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview We are a leading food and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the United States. The Dairy Group manufactures and sells its products under a variety of local and regional brand names and under private labels. Our WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, markets and sells a variety of well known soy, dairy and dairy related nationally branded products such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers and LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products. Our International Group is one of the largest processors and distributors of fluid milk in Spain and Portugal. Dairy Group Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment, with approximately 85% of our consolidated sales in 2005. Our Dairy Group manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream, cultured dairy products and juices to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across the United States. Due to the perishable nature of the Dairy Groups products, our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to its customers stores in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a direct store delivery or DSD system and we believe we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by the Dairy Groups corporate sales department. Most of the Dairy Groups customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. From 1990 through 2001, the dairy industry experienced significant consolidation, led by us. Consolidation has resulted in lower operating costs, less excess capacity and greater efficiency. However, consumption of traditional fluid dairy products has continued to decline. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 15% from 1990 to the end of 2004, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume sales growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic, in addition to the significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation, and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. WhiteWave Foods WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, develops, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; and LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells The Organic Cow organic dairy products; White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu and Hersheys milks and milkshakes. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. WhiteWave 23 Table of Contents Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the WhiteWave Foods Companys customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. In some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. International Group Our International Group, which consists of Leche Celta and Rachels Organic, does not qualify as a reportable segment. Leche Celta manufactures, markets and sells private label and branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. Rachels Organic markets and sells organic dairy products across the United Kingdom under the Rachels Organic and Divine Rice brand names. Effective January 1, 2006, Rachels Organic was consolidated with our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. Recent Developments Discontinued Operations On June 27, 2005, we completed the spin off (Spin off) of our indirect, majority owned subsidiary TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (TreeHouse). Immediately prior to the Spin off, we transferred to TreeHouse (1) the businesses previously conducted by our Specialty Foods Group segment, (2) the Mocha Mix and Second Nature businesses previously conducted by WhiteWave Foods Company, and (3) the foodservice salad dressings businesses previously conducted by the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company. The Spin off was effected by means of a share dividend of the TreeHouse common stock held by us to our stockholders of record on June 20, 2005 (the Record Date). In the distribution, our stockholders received one share of TreeHouse common stock for every five shares of our common stock held by them on the Record Date. On August 22, 2005, we completed the sale of certain tangible and intangible assets related to the production and distribution of Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips. We also licensed the Dean trademark to Ventura Foods for use on certain non dairy dips. The sales price was approximately $194 million. Both the TreeHouse Spin off and the Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips transactions were part of our strategy to focus on our core dairy and branded businesses. Prior periods have been revised to remove the results of our former Specialty Foods Group segment and Mocha Mix, Second Nature and private label dressings businesses and our Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips businesses, which have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Management Changes On August 25, 2005, we announced that we had selected Joseph E. Scalzo to serve as President and CEO of WhiteWave Foods Company. Mr. Scalzo, most recently Group President, Personal Care and Global Value Chain of the Gillette Company, joined WhiteWave Foods Company on October 11, 2005. On September 7, 2005, we announced the succession plan for the President of our Dairy Group. Alan Bernon, the former Chief Operating Officer of the Northeast region of our Dairy Group, succeeded Pete Schenkel effective January 1, 2006. Mr. Schenkel became Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors effective January 1, 2006, and he will assist in the transition of leadership of the Dairy Group through the end of 2007. 24 Table of Contents On October 14, 2005, we announced that Barry Fromberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will resign from his position on April 1, 2006. We are currently conducting a search for Mr. Frombergs successor. Stock Repurchases Between July 1 and December 31, 2005, we spent approximately $699.5 million to repurchase 18.9 million shares of our common stock for an average price of $37.05 per share, excluding commissions and fees. On August 10, 2005, and again on November 2, 2005 our Board of Directors authorized increases in our stock repurchase program in the aggregate amount of $600 million. Between January 1, 2006 and March 6, 2006 we spent approximately $15.3 million to repurchase an additional 400,000 shares of our common stock for an average price of $38.37, excluding commissions and fees. At March 6, 2006, approximately $3.2 million remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities In 2005, we recorded a charge of $38.6 million as part of our ongoing costs savings initiative. The Dairy Group recorded a charge of $25.3 million which included the closing of two facilities in 2005; we are consolidating production from these facilities into other Dairy Group facilities. Also in 2005, we made significant progress toward the consolidation and optimization of our WhiteWave Foods Company subsidiary. Specifically, we consolidated WhiteWave Foods Companys sales, marketing and research and development functions, which resulted in a charge of $10.2 million related to these activities. Also in 2005, we began a project to reorganize our International Group operations in response to a difficult operating environment, including eliminating and consolidating certain management, sales and purchasing functions, which resulted in a charge of $3.1 million related to these activities. We expect to incur additional charges related to all of these restructuring plans of approximately $7.1 million, primarily in 2006. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown, such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities, including termination of certain contractual agreements; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our facility closing and reorganization activities. Amendment to Credit Facility In May 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to lower the interest rate on the revolving credit facility and term loan. With the amendment, both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from zero to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). On November 18, 2005, we again amended our senior credit facility to change the maximum leverage covenant to 4.35 to 1.00 through March 31, 2007, and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter. 25 Table of Contents Debt Securities On December 14, 2005, we filed an immediately effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we registered debt securities that we may issue in the future. If and when the debt securities are issued, they will be unsecured obligations and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries.

Net sales in Corporate/ Other increased approximately $39.2 million primarily due to sales volume growth at Rachels Organic and Leche Celtas acquisition of Tiger Foods in the second quarter of 2004. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Cost of goods sold increased by approximately 3.6% to $7.92 billion in 2005 from $7.64 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and increased resin and other commodity costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group. Our cost of sales ratio decreased to 75.4% in 2005 compared to 76.1% in 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $171.7 million, or approximately 9.5%, during 2005 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Distribution costs increased approximately $91.2 million due to higher fuel costs and increased volumes at our Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company segments; Corporate expenses were approximately $32.0 million higher than last year, primarily due to: (1) increased employee compensation costs of approximately $17 million including charges related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock units and increased incentive compensation due to improved performance; (2) higher professional fees of approximately $11 million primarily related to the reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company; and (3) $3.1 million of severance expense for the former President of WhiteWave Foods Company. Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $14.0 million higher than 2004. See Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities. Other operating income declined by approximately $5.9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year due to a gain recorded in 2004 related to the settlement of litigation. Our operating expense ratio increased to 18.8% for 2005 as compared to 18.0% for 2004. Operating Income Operating income was $607.1 million in 2005, an increase of $19.7 million from 2004 operating income of $587.4 million. Our operating margin was 5.8% in 2005 compared to 5.9% in 2004. Other (Income) Expense Interest expense decreased to $169 million in 2005 from $198.9 million in 2004, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amended in August 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 37.9% in 2005 compared to 38.5% in 2004. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. In 2005, our income tax rate was positively impacted by the change in expected realization of net operating loss 27 Table of Contents carryforwards and a favorable tax settlement. In 2004, our tax rate was negatively impacted by the write off of deferred financing costs that were incurred in a business unit with a lower relative effective tax rate. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Results by Segment Dairy Group The key performance indicators of our Dairy Group segment are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,961.5 100.0 % $ 8,665.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,843.7 76.4 6,668.7 77.0 Gross profit 2,117.8 23.6 1,996.7 23.0 Operating costs and expenses 1,477.9 16.5 1,400.4 16.1 Total operating income $ 639.9 7.1 % $ 596.3 6.9 % The Dairy Groups net sales increased approximately $296.1 million, or 3.4%, in 2005 versus 2004. The change in net sales from 2004 to 2005 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2004 Net sales $ 8,665.4 Acquisitions 35.4 0.4 % Volume 163.5 1.9 Pricing and product mix 97.2 1.1 2005 Net sales $ 8,961.5 3.4 % The increase in the Dairy Groups sales was driven primarily by increased volumes. Volume sales of all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased 1.9% in 2005 compared to 2004. Volume sales of fresh milk, which were approximately 69% of the Dairy Groups 2005 volumes, were up approximately 2.5% for the year compared to USDA data showing a relatively flat total consumption of milk in the U.S. during the year. The increase in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily resulted from increased pricing due to the pass through of increased fuel and packaging costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in 2005. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials and other variable costs fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not always reflect the entire increase in raw material and other input costs that we may experience. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2005 compared to 2004: Year Ended December 31* 2005 2004 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1) $ 8.54 (2) $ 8.44 (2) 1 % Class I butterfat mover(1) 1.76 (3) 1.95 (3) (10 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 7.74 (2) 6.90 (2) 12 Class II butterfat minimum(4) 1.72 (3) 2.06 (3) (17 ) 28 Table of Contents * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Materials and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, which we estimate contributed an additional $35.4 million in sales during 2005. The Dairy Groups cost of sales increased to $6.84 billion in 2005 compared to $6.67 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and an approximately $43 million increase in resin costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs. Resin prices increased primarily due to significant supply constraints resulting from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Resin is the primary raw material in our plastic bottles. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio decreased to 76.4% in 2005 compared to 77.0% in 2005 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $77.5 million during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to (1) higher distribution costs of $60.7 million, $31 million of which was due to increased fuel prices and the remaining increase was driven by increased volumes; (2) higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $12 million due to improved operating results and (3) higher bad debt expense. Bad debt expense increased approximately $9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the write off of a receivable from a large customer, as well as the relatively higher level of bad debt recoveries recognized in 2004. The Dairy Groups operating expense ratio increased to 16.5% in 2005 from 16.1% in 2004. WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,144.3 100.0 % $ 1,010.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 734.5 64.2 660.3 65.4 Gross profit 409.8 35.8 350.0 34.6 Operating costs and expenses 294.9 25.8 262.6 25.9 Total operating income $ 114.9 10.0 % $ 87.4 8.7 % 29 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by approximately $134 million, or 13.3%, in 2005 versus 2004. The change in net sales from 2004 to 2005 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2004 Net sales $ 1,010.3 Acquisitions 9.2 0.9 % Volume 58.7 5.8 Pricing and product mix 66.1 6.6 2005 Net sales $ 1,144.3 13.3 % Double digit volume growth in our Silk and Horizon Organic brands, combined with somewhat slower growth in International Delight and LAND OLAKES, was partly offset by elimination of certain product offerings. We believe increased Silk and Horizon Organic volumes were due primarily to increased consumer acceptance and increased marketing efforts. We are in the process of eliminating certain products and brands from our portfolio of products, which negatively impacted our sales growth in 2005. If we excluded the discontinued products from 2004 and 2005 results, our sales would have increased approximately 15% in 2005 over the prior year. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs, and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales. We also benefited from the 2004 acquisition of the LAND OLAKES cream, sour cream, and whipping cream business in the Eastern part of the U.S. which we estimate added $9.2 million to our sales growth. Cost of sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $734.5 million in 2005 from $660.3 million in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly organic raw milk and organic soybeans, which increased cost of sales by approximately $26 million. The cost of sales ratio declined to 64.2% in 2005 from 65.4% in 2004 due to the impact of supply chain changes and product rationalization in 2005. Operating expenses increased approximately $32.3 million in 2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $22 million to distribution expenses. Compensation expense also increased as a result of increased staffing levels to support the growth of our organization. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 19.6% to $10.04 billion during 2004 from $8.39 billion in 2003. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below.

We acquired Kohler Mix Specialties, Melody Farms and Ross Swiss Dairies in our Dairy Group segment; Horizon Organic and LAND OLAKES East in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment and Tiger Foods in our Corporate/ Other segment. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Our cost of sales ratio increased to 76.1% in 2004 compared to 74.1% in 2003 due almost entirely to increased raw material costs that affected both of our segments in 2004. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $265.7 million, or approximately 17.2%, during 2004 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Acquisitions, which we estimate represented approximately $118 million of the increase. A $62.8 million decline in other operating income compared to 2003 primarily due to a $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business that reduced operating expenses in 2003. Higher fuel costs in both segments and increased volumes at the WhiteWave Foods Company, which we estimate added a combined total of approximately $25 million to distribution costs for 2004 as compared to 2003. Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $12.8 million higher than in 2003. Corporate expenses that were approximately $10 million higher than the prior year, including higher professional fees and legal fees primarily related to the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company, increased transactional activity and higher regulatory compliance fees. Our operating expense ratio decreased slightly to 18.0% for 2004 compared to 18.3% for 2003. Operating Income Operating income during 2004 was $587.4 million, a decrease of $47 million from 2003 operating income of $634.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to the $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business in 2003. Our operating margin in 2004 was 5.9% compared to 7.6% in 2003. Our operating margin decreased primarily as a result of higher raw material costs and the effect of increased sales. Other (Income) Expense Total other (income) expense increased by $13.2 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest expense increased to $198.9 million in 2004 from $173.9 million in 2003, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amended in August 2004. This charge was partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower interest rates during 2004. There were no financing charges on preferred securities in 2004 as compared to $14.2 million in 31 Table of Contents 2003. Our convertible preferred securities were converted into common stock in the second quarter of 2003. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.5% in 2004 compared to 38.6% in 2003. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Results by Segment Dairy Group The key performance indicators of our Dairy Group segment are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income.

(4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The other primary cause of the increase in the Dairy Groups net sales was acquisitions. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, Ross Swiss Dairies in January 2004, Kohler Mix Specialties in October 2003 and Melody Farms in June 2003, which we estimate contributed a combined total of $386.2 million in sales during 2004. These increases were slightly offset by the divestiture in July 2003 of the frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. Volume sales of all Dairy Group products increased 0.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Volume sales of milk and cream, which were approximately 71% of the Dairy Groups 2004 sales, were up approximately 1.2% for the year compared to USDA data showing a 0.8% decline in total consumption of milk and cream in the U.S. during the year. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio was higher in 2004 at 77% compared to 74.5% for 2003 primarily due to the increase in raw milk costs compared to the prior year. The average minimum price of Class I raw skim milk (as indicated by the Class I mover, described above) was 13% higher and the average Class I butterfat mover increased 64% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Our costs were also impacted by resin prices as they continued to rise. Higher resin prices impacted the cost of our plastic bottles by approximately $17 million. Due to a very competitive retail environment in 2004, we were unable to pass along the entire increase in raw material and other variable input costs to our customers. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $116.3 million during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to (1) acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $61 million in operating costs; (2) higher fuel costs of which approximately $14 million was related to an increase in fuel prices and (3) an increase in insurance expense due to our claims experience. The increase in sales volumes also contributed to our higher operating expenses. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, primarily due to more favorable than expected resolution of previously accrued bad debt reserves. These bad debt reserves were recorded for certain customers that experienced economic difficulty and a few large customers that sought bankruptcy protection over the past several years. The Dairy Groups operating expense ratio decreased to 16.1% in 2004 from 17.0% in 2003 due to the effect of increased sales. WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,010.3 100.0 % $ 598.9 100.0 % Cost of sales 660.3 65.4 386.3 64.5 Gross profit 350.0 34.6 212.6 35.5 Operating costs and expenses 262.6 25.9 209.7 35.0 Total operating income $ 87.4 8.7 % $ 2.9 0.5 % 33 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by $411.4 million, or 68.7%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 598.9 Acquisitions 232.9 38.9 % Divestitures (4.0 ) (0.7 ) Volume 96.3 16.1 Pricing and product mix 86.2 14.4 2004 Net sales $ 1,010.3 68.7 % The most significant cause of the increase in WhiteWave Foods Companys sales was the acquisition of Horizon Organic effective January 1, 2004, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of the LAND OLAKES cream, sour cream and whipping cream business in the Eastern part of the U.S. effective March 31, 2004. Another significant cause of the increase in sales was increased volumes. Volume sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased approximately 16.1% in 2004 due to the success of our brands, particularly Silk and International Delight. We believe increased Silk volumes were due primarily to: (1) increased consumer acceptance of soy products, resulting in increased penetration of soymilk in the club, mass merchandiser and grocery channels; (2) the positive effects of our consumer advertising; and (3) the introduction of new Silk products with nutritional enhancements, new flavors and larger size offerings. We believe the increase in International Delight volumes is due primarily to consumer acceptance of new packaging introduced in 2003 and new low carb flavors introduced in 2004. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales, as we shift our focus toward consumer oriented advertising and marketing, which are recorded as operating expense. These increases were offset slightly by the divestiture in July 2003 of the branded frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. Cost of goods sold for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $660.3 million in 2004 from $386.3 million in 2003 primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly Class II butterfat and organic soybeans, and the addition of Horizon Organic. The average minimum price of Class II butterfat was 69% higher in 2004 than in 2003. Our average cost of organic soybeans was approximately 40% higher in 2004 than in 2003 primarily due to an increase in domestic organic soybean prices and the utilization of foreign grown organic soybeans, which have a higher price than domestic beans. The cost of sales ratio increased slightly to 65.4% in 2004 from 64.5% in 2003 primarily due to the effect of increased sales. Operating expenses increased approximately $52.9 million in 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $47 million in costs, and increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $11.5 million to distribution expenses. Marketing spending increased approximately 6% in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases were somewhat offset by a decline of approximately $16.1 million related to the expiration of the White Wave management incentive plan in March 2004. The operating expense ratio decreased to 25.9% during 2004 from 35.0% during the prior year primarily due to the relatively smaller increase in operating expense dollars compared to the increase in sales dollars. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow During 2005, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $541.0 million for 2005 as compared to $420.7 million for 34 Table of Contents 2004, an increase of $120.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was impacted by a decrease in our working capital of $15 million in 2005 compared to an increase of $211.7 million in 2004 due primarily to lower raw milk costs in 2005. In addition, income taxes payable decreased $37.1 million in 2005 compared to a decrease of $10.0 million in 2004 due to the timing of tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $109.8 million in 2005 compared to $723.2 million in 2004, a decrease of $613.4 million. We used approximately $1.8 million for acquisitions and $306.8 million for capital expenditures in 2005 compared to $400.0 million and $333.8 million in 2004, respectively. We received cash proceeds from the sale of operations of $189.9 million in 2005. We used approximately $699.9 million to repurchase our stock during 2005. Set forth in the chart below is a summary of the stock we repurchased in 2005: No. of Shares of Aggregate Average Common Stock Purchase Purchase Price Period Repurchased Price(1) Per Share (Dollars in millions except per share data) July 2005 1,907,100 $ 68.9 $ 36.11 August 2005 3,927,600 140.6 35.80 September 2005 4,091,300 151.8 37.10 October 2005 1,422,500 54.0 37.95 November 2005 5,995,400 224.6 37.46 December 2005 1,537,400 60.0 39.04 18,881,300 $ 699.9 37.07 (1) Includes commissions and fees. We received approximately $73.1 million in 2005 as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. We increased our net borrowings by $175.7 million in 2005 compared to a net borrowing of $441.9 million in 2004. Current Debt Obligations Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. In May 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to lower the interest rate on the revolving credit facility and term loan. With the amendment, both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from 0 to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 5.16% at December 31, 2005. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged $1.625 billion of our borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 4.5%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows: $56.25 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008; $262.5 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2008 through June 30, 2009; and A final payment of $262.5 million on the maturity date of August 13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility until maturity on August 13, 2009. 35 Table of Contents The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or recovery events. In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving credit facility that ranges from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. On November 18, 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to change the maximum leverage covenant to 4.35 to 1.00 through March 31, 2007 and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval: (1) the acquired company is involved in the manufacture, processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any other line of business in which we are currently engaged, (2) the net cash purchase price is not greater than $500 million, (3) we acquire at least 51% of the acquired entity, (4) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target and (5) after giving effect to such acquisition on a pro forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of Legacy Deans subsidiaries, and the real property owned by Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The credit agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our credit rating. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding borrowings of $2.26 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $2.03 billion at December 31, 2004), including $1.5 billion in term loan borrowings and $758.6 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2005, there were $112.1 million of letters of credit under the revolving line that were issued but undrawn. As of March 6, 2006, approximately $568.1 million was outstanding under our senior credit facility. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $600 million receivables backed credit facility, which had $548.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2005 (compared to $500 million at December 31, 2004). The receivables backed facility was fully funded at December 31, 2005. The average interest rate on this facility at December 31, 2005 was 4.6%. Approximately $516.1 million was outstanding under this facility at March 6, 2006. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables backed facility. Our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility and receivables backed credit facility increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily to fund our share repurchases. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2005 also included $600 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Legacy Deans senior notes, a $40.9 million line of credit at our Spanish subsidiary and approximately $20.5 million face value of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness, purchase and lease obligations at December 31, 2005. Please see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail about our lease and purchase obligations.

(2) Primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes, including organic soybeans and organic raw milk. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process. (3) Includes fixed rate interest obligations as well as interest on our variable rate debt based on the rates and balances in effect at December 31, 2005. Interest that may be due in the future on the variable rate portion of our senior credit facility will vary based on the interest rate in effect at the time and the borrowings outstanding at the time. Other Long Term Liabilities We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan also may impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension and postretirement costs also may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation and annual periodic pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits, changes in obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. In 2005, we recorded non cash pension expense of $11.5 million, of which $8.0 million was attributable to periodic expense and $3.5 million was attributable to settlements compared to a total of $9.8 million in 2004, of which $1.8 million was attributable to settlements. These amounts were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. 37 Table of Contents The assumed discount rate was 5.75% at December 31, 2004 and 2005. In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations and fiscal year end disclosure, an analysis is performed in which the duration of projected cash flows from defined benefit and retiree health care plans are matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available. We use the results of the yield curve analysis to select the discount rate that matches the duration and payment stream of the benefits in each plan. Each rate is rounded to the nearest quarter of a percent. In selecting the assumed rate of return on plan assets, we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan, as well as our investment allocation policy and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We rebalance the investments when the allocation is not within the target range. The results are adjusted for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe these assumptions are appropriate based upon the mix of investments and the long term nature of the plans investments. Plan asset returns were $14.1 million in 2005, a $2.9 million increase from plan asset returns of $11.2 million in 2004. Net periodic pension expense for our plans is expected to decrease in 2006 to approximately $9.5 million due primarily to the increase in assets from $165.3 million as of December 31, 2004 to $190.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Based on current projections, 2006 funding requirements will be approximately $25.8 million as compared to $34.1 million for 2005. The postretirement benefit plans are not funded. Based on current projections, 2006 cash requirements to pay benefits for our other postretirement benefit obligations will remain at approximately $2.6 million, the same as the 2005 cash requirements. We were required to recognize an additional minimum liability for certain pension plans as prescribed by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. The accumulated other comprehensive income component of the additional minimum liability, which totaled $18.5 million ($11.8 million net of tax), was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income, and did not affect net income for 2005. The charge to Other Comprehensive Income will be reversed in future periods to the extent the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. See Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Other Commitments and Contingencies On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments we make under this note, if any, will be expensed as incurred. We also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation, investigations and audits: certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested; certain lease obligations, which require us to guarantee the minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease; and selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. 38 Table of Contents See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations. Future Capital Requirements During 2006, we intend to invest a total of approximately $260 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. The lower amount from the prior year reflects the completion of several major capital projects in 2005. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. We intend to spend this amount as follows: Operating Division Amount (In millions) Dairy Group $ 164 WhiteWave Foods Company 81 Other 15 Total $ 260 In 2006, we expect cash interest to be approximately $195 million based on current debt levels and cash taxes to be approximately $120 million. We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. As of March 6, 2006, approximately $568.1 million was available for future borrowings under our senior credit facility. Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs Dairy Group The primary raw material used in our Dairy Group is raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat). The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw milk, and those prices change on a monthly basis. The regulated minimum prices differ based on how the raw milk is utilized. Raw milk processed into fluid milk is priced at the Class I price, and raw milk processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream is priced at the Class II price. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain producer premiums (or over order premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw milk costs, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in our raw milk costs can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. Because our Class II products typically have a higher fat content than that contained in raw milk, we also purchase bulk cream for use in some of our Class II products. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Another significant raw material used by our Dairy Group is resin, which is used to make plastic bottles. Resin is a petroleum based product and the price of resin generally has increased recently due to increases in crude oil prices. Our Dairy Group purchases approximately four million gallons of diesel fuel per month to operate our extensive direct store delivery system. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices that it charges for Class I dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw milk, packaging, fuel and other materials fluctuate. Prices for some Class II products are also changed monthly while others are changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, especially in the case of Class II butterfat because Class II butterfat prices for each month are not announced by the government until after the end of that month. Also, in some cases we are competitively or contractually constrained with the means and timing of implementing price changes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margin fluctuate with the price of our raw materials and other inputs. 39 Table of Contents In 2004, our Dairy Group was adversely affected by extreme volatility in the prices of raw skim milk, butterfat and cream. In 2005, prices for raw skim milk, butterfat and cream were more stable than in 2004 but remained high. We expect raw milk, butterfat and cream prices to decrease slightly over the first two quarters of 2006. However, raw milk, butterfat and cream prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. Due to the disruption in production caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the prices of resin and fuel have increased dramatically and resin supplies have from time to time been insufficient to meet demand. We are undertaking all reasonable measures in an attempt to secure an adequate resin supply; however, there can be no assurance that we will always be successful in our attempts. We expect prices of both resin and diesel fuel to remain high throughout 2006. WhiteWave Foods Company A significant raw material used to manufacture products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company is organic soybeans. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs for 2006. Generally, these agreements provide for pricing at fixed levels. However, should our need for organic soybeans exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we would be required to pay likely would be significantly higher. The increase in soymilk consumption combined with the increased demand for organic soybeans in cattle feed has put pressure on the supply of organic soybeans and there is a risk of significant upward pressure on organic soybean prices. Another significant raw material used in our organic products is organic raw milk. Organic raw milk is not readily available and the growth of our organic dairy business depends on us being able to procure sufficient quantities of organic raw milk in time to meet our needs. We obtain our supply of organic raw milk by entering into one to two year agreements with farmers pursuant to which the farmers agree to sell us specified quantities of organic raw milk for fixed prices for the duration of the agreement. The industry wide demand for organic raw milk has exceeded supply, resulting in our inability to fully meet customer demand. As a result at times we are forced to limit quantities we ship to our customers. We expect to continue to limit quantities available to customers of organic milk into the second quarter of 2006. Also, as our contracts with farmers expire, we are generally required to agree to higher prices to renew as a result of increased competition for organic raw milk supply. The increase in the demand for organic milk combined with competitive activity and a limited supply has put significant upward pressure on organic raw milk costs. Competitive Environment There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery industry in recent years, and this trend is continuing. As our customer base consolidates, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers or gain new customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. Many of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current intensely competitive environment. Over the past few years, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group segment, which reduced our profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend to continue. In bidding situations we are subject to the risk of losing certain customers altogether. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have contracts with many of our largest customers, and most of the contracts that we do have are generally terminable at will by the customer. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail level have caused competition to become increasingly intense at the processor level. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. 40 Table of Contents Tax Rate In 2005, our tax rate on continuing operations was 37.9%. We estimate the effective tax rate for 2006 will be in the range of 38% to 38.5%. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, adoption of SFAS 123(R) related to expensing of stock options, as well as recent and proposed changes to federal and state tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Accounts Receivable We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. As these factors change, our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $22.1 million, or approximately 2.6% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005. The allowance for doubtful accounts, expressed as a percent of accounts receivable, was approximately 2.9% at December 31, 2004. Each 0.10% change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately $867,000. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Substantially all of our qualified pension plans are consolidated into one master trust. We retained investment consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to help our Investment Committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust. Our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at 65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. At December 31, 2005, our master trust was invested as follows: equity securities and limited partnerships 71%; fixed income securities 27%; and cash and cash equivalents 2%. We determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plans investments based on target allocations of the pension plans investments. Additionally, we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plans investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other investments. The resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.5%. While a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature, including assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and mortality 41 Table of Contents rates, generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption reflect current market conditions. As such, our discount rate likely will change more frequently than in prior years. The discount rate utilized to determine our estimated future benefit obligations remained the same at 5.75% at December 31, 2004 and 2005. A 0.25% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $470,000 and $360,000, respectively. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $161,000. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.61 billion as of December 31, 2005 resulting primarily from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. We believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support. Perpetual trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. A reporting unit can be a segment or an operating division. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual trademarks or goodwill during 2005. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period, which could have an impact on our earnings. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our valuation allowance decreased $481,000 in 2005 in anticipation of the expected realization of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously reserved. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are 42 Table of Contents developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $161.2 million and $143.0 million, respectively, including both current and long term liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations in March 2005. This Interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and also clarifies when an entity should have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2005. We recognized expense of $1.6 million, net of tax, in 2005 as a cumulative change in accounting principle as a result of adopting the standard. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in December 2004. It will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant date fair values. That cost will be recognized over the vesting period. SFAS No. 123(R) became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. As permitted under the Statement we will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) retroactively. The historical pro forma expense we have reported will be the expense applied for our retroactive adoption of the Statement. Refer to the section titled Stock Based Compensation in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an illustration of the pro forma impact of expensing our stock options in the historical periods. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151, which is effective for inventory costs incurred during years beginning after June 15, 2005, clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the rule in APB No. 29 which excluded from fair value measurement exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead SFAS No. 153 excludes from fair value measurement exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2005: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 $ 625 4.81% to 4.84% December 2007 500 4.07% to 4.27% December 2010 500 43 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2004: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 $ 400 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 375 We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $8.5 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2005 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote because the counter parties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to the pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 44 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview We are a leading food and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the United States. The Dairy Group manufactures and sells its products under a variety of local and regional brand names and under private labels. Our WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, markets and sells a variety of well known soy, dairy and dairy related nationally branded products such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers and LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products. Our International Group is one of the largest processors and distributors of fluid milk in Spain and Portugal. Dairy Group Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment, with approximately 85% of our consolidated sales in 2005. Our Dairy Group manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream, cultured dairy products and juices to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across the United States. Due to the perishable nature of the Dairy Groups products, our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to its customers stores in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a direct store delivery or DSD system and we believe we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by the Dairy Groups corporate sales department. Most of the Dairy Groups customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. From 1990 through 2001, the dairy industry experienced significant consolidation, led by us. Consolidation has resulted in lower operating costs, less excess capacity and greater efficiency. However, consumption of traditional fluid dairy products has continued to decline. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 15% from 1990 to the end of 2004, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume sales growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic, in addition to the significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation, and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. WhiteWave Foods WhiteWave Foods Company manufactures, develops, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products; Horizon Organic dairy and other products; International Delight coffee creamers; and LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells The Organic Cow organic dairy products; White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu and Hersheys milks and milkshakes. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. WhiteWave 23 Table of Contents Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the WhiteWave Foods Companys customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. In some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. International Group Our International Group, which consists of Leche Celta and Rachels Organic, does not qualify as a reportable segment. Leche Celta manufactures, markets and sells private label and branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. Rachels Organic markets and sells organic dairy products across the United Kingdom under the Rachels Organic and Divine Rice brand names. Effective January 1, 2006, Rachels Organic was consolidated with our WhiteWave Foods Company segment. Recent Developments Discontinued Operations On June 27, 2005, we completed the spin off (Spin off) of our indirect, majority owned subsidiary TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (TreeHouse). Immediately prior to the Spin off, we transferred to TreeHouse (1) the businesses previously conducted by our Specialty Foods Group segment, (2) the Mocha Mix and Second Nature businesses previously conducted by WhiteWave Foods Company, and (3) the foodservice salad dressings businesses previously conducted by the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company. The Spin off was effected by means of a share dividend of the TreeHouse common stock held by us to our stockholders of record on June 20, 2005 (the Record Date). In the distribution, our stockholders received one share of TreeHouse common stock for every five shares of our common stock held by them on the Record Date. On August 22, 2005, we completed the sale of certain tangible and intangible assets related to the production and distribution of Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips. We also licensed the Dean trademark to Ventura Foods for use on certain non dairy dips. The sales price was approximately $194 million. Both the TreeHouse Spin off and the Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips transactions were part of our strategy to focus on our core dairy and branded businesses. Prior periods have been revised to remove the results of our former Specialty Foods Group segment and Mocha Mix, Second Nature and private label dressings businesses and our Maries dips and dressings and Deans dips businesses, which have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Management Changes On August 25, 2005, we announced that we had selected Joseph E. Scalzo to serve as President and CEO of WhiteWave Foods Company. Mr. Scalzo, most recently Group President, Personal Care and Global Value Chain of the Gillette Company, joined WhiteWave Foods Company on October 11, 2005. On September 7, 2005, we announced the succession plan for the President of our Dairy Group. Alan Bernon, the former Chief Operating Officer of the Northeast region of our Dairy Group, succeeded Pete Schenkel effective January 1, 2006. Mr. Schenkel became Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors effective January 1, 2006, and he will assist in the transition of leadership of the Dairy Group through the end of 2007. 24 Table of Contents On October 14, 2005, we announced that Barry Fromberg, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will resign from his position on April 1, 2006. We are currently conducting a search for Mr. Frombergs successor. Stock Repurchases Between July 1 and December 31, 2005, we spent approximately $699.5 million to repurchase 18.9 million shares of our common stock for an average price of $37.05 per share, excluding commissions and fees. On August 10, 2005, and again on November 2, 2005 our Board of Directors authorized increases in our stock repurchase program in the aggregate amount of $600 million. Between January 1, 2006 and March 6, 2006 we spent approximately $15.3 million to repurchase an additional 400,000 shares of our common stock for an average price of $38.37, excluding commissions and fees. At March 6, 2006, approximately $3.2 million remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities In 2005, we recorded a charge of $38.6 million as part of our ongoing costs savings initiative. The Dairy Group recorded a charge of $25.3 million which included the closing of two facilities in 2005; we are consolidating production from these facilities into other Dairy Group facilities. Also in 2005, we made significant progress toward the consolidation and optimization of our WhiteWave Foods Company subsidiary. Specifically, we consolidated WhiteWave Foods Companys sales, marketing and research and development functions, which resulted in a charge of $10.2 million related to these activities. Also in 2005, we began a project to reorganize our International Group operations in response to a difficult operating environment, including eliminating and consolidating certain management, sales and purchasing functions, which resulted in a charge of $3.1 million related to these activities. We expect to incur additional charges related to all of these restructuring plans of approximately $7.1 million, primarily in 2006. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown, such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities, including termination of certain contractual agreements; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our facility closing and reorganization activities. Amendment to Credit Facility In May 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to lower the interest rate on the revolving credit facility and term loan. With the amendment, both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from zero to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). On November 18, 2005, we again amended our senior credit facility to change the maximum leverage covenant to 4.35 to 1.00 through March 31, 2007, and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter. 25 Table of Contents Debt Securities On December 14, 2005, we filed an immediately effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we registered debt securities that we may issue in the future. If and when the debt securities are issued, they will be unsecured obligations and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries.

Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales 2005 2004 $ Increase % Increase (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 8,961.5 $ 8,665.4 $ 296.1 3.4 % WhiteWave Foods Company 1,144.3 1,010.3 134.0 13.3 Corporate/ Other 399.8 360.6 39.2 10.9 Total $ 10,505.6 $ 10,036.3 $ 469.3 4.7 % 26 Table of Contents The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2005 vs. 2004 Pricing, Volume Foreign and Product Total Acquisitions Exchange Mix Changes Increase (In millions) Dairy Group $ 35.4 $ $ 260.7 $ 296.1 WhiteWave Foods Company 9.2 124.8 134.0 Corporate/Other 14.5 0.1 24.6 39.2 Total $ 59.1 $ 0.1 $ 410.1 $ 469.3 Net sales increased approximately $469.3 million during 2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to strong volume growth and increased pricing in the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company segments. Net sales in Corporate/ Other increased approximately $39.2 million primarily due to sales volume growth at Rachels Organic and Leche Celtas acquisition of Tiger Foods in the second quarter of 2004. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Cost of goods sold increased by approximately 3.6% to $7.92 billion in 2005 from $7.64 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and increased resin and other commodity costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group. Our cost of sales ratio decreased to 75.4% in 2005 compared to 76.1% in 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $171.7 million, or approximately 9.5%, during 2005 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Distribution costs increased approximately $91.2 million due to higher fuel costs and increased volumes at our Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company segments; Corporate expenses were approximately $32.0 million higher than last year, primarily due to: (1) increased employee compensation costs of approximately $17 million including charges related to the accelerated vesting of certain stock units and increased incentive compensation due to improved performance; (2) higher professional fees of approximately $11 million primarily related to the reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company; and (3) $3.1 million of severance expense for the former President of WhiteWave Foods Company. Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $14.0 million higher than 2004. See Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities. Other operating income declined by approximately $5.9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year due to a gain recorded in 2004 related to the settlement of litigation. Our operating expense ratio increased to 18.8% for 2005 as compared to 18.0% for 2004. Operating Income Operating income was $607.1 million in 2005, an increase of $19.7 million from 2004 operating income of $587.4 million. Our operating margin was 5.8% in 2005 compared to 5.9% in 2004. Other (Income) Expense Interest expense decreased to $169 million in 2005 from $198.9 million in 2004, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amended in August 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 37.9% in 2005 compared to 38.5% in 2004. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. In 2005, our income tax rate was positively impacted by the change in expected realization of net operating loss 27 Table of Contents carryforwards and a favorable tax settlement. In 2004, our tax rate was negatively impacted by the write off of deferred financing costs that were incurred in a business unit with a lower relative effective tax rate. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Results by Segment Dairy Group The key performance indicators of our Dairy Group segment are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,961.5 100.0 % $ 8,665.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,843.7 76.4 6,668.7 77.0 Gross profit 2,117.8 23.6 1,996.7 23.0 Operating costs and expenses 1,477.9 16.5 1,400.4 16.1 Total operating income $ 639.9 7.1 % $ 596.3 6.9 % The Dairy Groups net sales increased approximately $296.1 million, or 3.4%, in 2005 versus 2004. The change in net sales from 2004 to 2005 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2004 Net sales $ 8,665.4 Acquisitions 35.4 0.4 % Volume 163.5 1.9 Pricing and product mix 97.2 1.1 2005 Net sales $ 8,961.5 3.4 % The increase in the Dairy Groups sales was driven primarily by increased volumes. Volume sales of all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased 1.9% in 2005 compared to 2004. Volume sales of fresh milk, which were approximately 69% of the Dairy Groups 2005 volumes, were up approximately 2.5% for the year compared to USDA data showing a relatively flat total consumption of milk in the U.S. during the year. The increase in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily resulted from increased pricing due to the pass through of increased fuel and packaging costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in 2005. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials and other variable costs fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not always reflect the entire increase in raw material and other input costs that we may experience. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2005 compared to 2004: Year Ended December 31* 2005 2004 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1) $ 8.54 (2) $ 8.44 (2) 1 % Class I butterfat mover(1) 1.76 (3) 1.95 (3) (10 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 7.74 (2) 6.90 (2) 12 Class II butterfat minimum(4) 1.72 (3) 2.06 (3) (17 ) 28 Table of Contents * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Materials and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, which we estimate contributed an additional $35.4 million in sales during 2005. The Dairy Groups cost of sales increased to $6.84 billion in 2005 compared to $6.67 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and an approximately $43 million increase in resin costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs. Resin prices increased primarily due to significant supply constraints resulting from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Resin is the primary raw material in our plastic bottles. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio decreased to 76.4% in 2005 compared to 77.0% in 2005 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $77.5 million during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to (1) higher distribution costs of $60.7 million, $31 million of which was due to increased fuel prices and the remaining increase was driven by increased volumes; (2) higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $12 million due to improved operating results and (3) higher bad debt expense. Bad debt expense increased approximately $9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the write off of a receivable from a large customer, as well as the relatively higher level of bad debt recoveries recognized in 2004. The Dairy Groups operating expense ratio increased to 16.5% in 2005 from 16.1% in 2004. WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,144.3 100.0 % $ 1,010.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 734.5 64.2 660.3 65.4 Gross profit 409.8 35.8 350.0 34.6 Operating costs and expenses 294.9 25.8 262.6 25.9 Total operating income $ 114.9 10.0 % $ 87.4 8.7 % 29 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by approximately $134 million, or 13.3%, in 2005 versus 2004. The change in net sales from 2004 to 2005 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2004 Net sales $ 1,010.3 Acquisitions 9.2 0.9 % Volume 58.7 5.8 Pricing and product mix 66.1 6.6 2005 Net sales $ 1,144.3 13.3 % Double digit volume growth in our Silk and Horizon Organic brands, combined with somewhat slower growth in International Delight and LAND OLAKES, was partly offset by elimination of certain product offerings. We believe increased Silk and Horizon Organic volumes were due primarily to increased consumer acceptance and increased marketing efforts. We are in the process of eliminating certain products and brands from our portfolio of products, which negatively impacted our sales growth in 2005. If we excluded the discontinued products from 2004 and 2005 results, our sales would have increased approximately 15% in 2005 over the prior year. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs, and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales. We also benefited from the 2004 acquisition of the LAND OLAKES cream, sour cream, and whipping cream business in the Eastern part of the U.S. which we estimate added $9.2 million to our sales growth. Cost of sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $734.5 million in 2005 from $660.3 million in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly organic raw milk and organic soybeans, which increased cost of sales by approximately $26 million. The cost of sales ratio declined to 64.2% in 2005 from 65.4% in 2004 due to the impact of supply chain changes and product rationalization in 2005. Operating expenses increased approximately $32.3 million in 2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $22 million to distribution expenses. Compensation expense also increased as a result of increased staffing levels to support the growth of our organization. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 19.6% to $10.04 billion during 2004 from $8.39 billion in 2003. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales $ Increase/ % Increase/ 2004 2003 (Decrease) (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 8,665.4 $ 7,547.2 $ 1,118.2 14.8 % WhiteWave Foods Company 1,010.3 598.9 411.4 68.7 Corporate/ Other 360.6 244.9 115.7 47.2 Total $ 10,036.3 $ 8,391.0 $ 1,645.3 19.6 30 Table of Contents The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2004 vs. 2003 Pricing, Volume Total Foreign and Product Increase/ Acquisitions Divestitures Exchange Mix Changes (Decrease) (In millions) Dairy Group $ 386.2 $ (26.2 ) $ $ 758.2 $ 1,118.2 WhiteWave Foods Company 232.9 (4.0 ) 182.5 411.4 Corporate/ Other 67.9 28.1 19.7 115.7 Total $ 687.0 $ (30.2 ) $ 28.1 $ 960.4 $ 1,645.3 Net sales increased approximately $1.65 billion during 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher selling prices resulting from the pass through of increased raw milk costs and due to acquisitions. We acquired Kohler Mix Specialties, Melody Farms and Ross Swiss Dairies in our Dairy Group segment; Horizon Organic and LAND OLAKES East in our WhiteWave Foods Company segment and Tiger Foods in our Corporate/ Other segment. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Our cost of sales ratio increased to 76.1% in 2004 compared to 74.1% in 2003 due almost entirely to increased raw material costs that affected both of our segments in 2004. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $265.7 million, or approximately 17.2%, during 2004 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Acquisitions, which we estimate represented approximately $118 million of the increase. A $62.8 million decline in other operating income compared to 2003 primarily due to a $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business that reduced operating expenses in 2003. Higher fuel costs in both segments and increased volumes at the WhiteWave Foods Company, which we estimate added a combined total of approximately $25 million to distribution costs for 2004 as compared to 2003. Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $12.8 million higher than in 2003. Corporate expenses that were approximately $10 million higher than the prior year, including higher professional fees and legal fees primarily related to the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company, increased transactional activity and higher regulatory compliance fees. Our operating expense ratio decreased slightly to 18.0% for 2004 compared to 18.3% for 2003. Operating Income Operating income during 2004 was $587.4 million, a decrease of $47 million from 2003 operating income of $634.4 million. This decrease was primarily due to the $66.2 million gain on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping business in 2003. Our operating margin in 2004 was 5.9% compared to 7.6% in 2003. Our operating margin decreased primarily as a result of higher raw material costs and the effect of increased sales. Other (Income) Expense Total other (income) expense increased by $13.2 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Interest expense increased to $198.9 million in 2004 from $173.9 million in 2003, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amended in August 2004. This charge was partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower interest rates during 2004. There were no financing charges on preferred securities in 2004 as compared to $14.2 million in 31 Table of Contents 2003. Our convertible preferred securities were converted into common stock in the second quarter of 2003. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.5% in 2004 compared to 38.6% in 2003. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Results by Segment Dairy Group The key performance indicators of our Dairy Group segment are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,665.4 100.0 % $ 7,547.2 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,668.7 77.0 5,622.9 74.5 Gross profit 1,996.7 23.0 1,924.3 25.5 Operating costs and expenses 1,400.4 16.1 1,284.1 17.0 Total operating income $ 596.3 6.9 % $ 640.2 8.5 % The Dairy Groups net sales increased by approximately $1.12 billion, or 14.8%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 7,547.2 Acquisitions 386.2 5.1 % Divestitures (26.2 ) (0.3 ) Volume 11.2 0.1 Pricing and product mix 747.0 9.9 2004 Net sales $ 8,665.4 14.8 % The Dairy Groups net sales increased primarily due to pricing and product mix resulting from increased pricing due to the pass through of higher raw milk costs in 2004. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials and other variable input costs fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increase may not reflect the entire increase in raw material or other variable costs that we experience. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2004 compared to 2003: Year Ended December 31* 2004 2003 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(3) $ 8.44 (1) $ 7.47 (1) 13 % Class I butterfat mover(3) 1.95 (2) 1.19 (2) 64 Class II raw skim milk minimum(4) 6.90 (1) 6.74 (1) 2 Class II butterfat minimum(4) 2.06 (2) 1.22 (2) 69 * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The federal order minimum prices at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges 32 Table of Contents that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) Prices are per hundredweight. (2) Prices are per pound. (3) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The other primary cause of the increase in the Dairy Groups net sales was acquisitions. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, Ross Swiss Dairies in January 2004, Kohler Mix Specialties in October 2003 and Melody Farms in June 2003, which we estimate contributed a combined total of $386.2 million in sales during 2004. These increases were slightly offset by the divestiture in July 2003 of the frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. Volume sales of all Dairy Group products increased 0.1% in 2004 compared to 2003. Volume sales of milk and cream, which were approximately 71% of the Dairy Groups 2004 sales, were up approximately 1.2% for the year compared to USDA data showing a 0.8% decline in total consumption of milk and cream in the U.S. during the year. The Dairy Groups cost of sales ratio was higher in 2004 at 77% compared to 74.5% for 2003 primarily due to the increase in raw milk costs compared to the prior year. The average minimum price of Class I raw skim milk (as indicated by the Class I mover, described above) was 13% higher and the average Class I butterfat mover increased 64% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Our costs were also impacted by resin prices as they continued to rise. Higher resin prices impacted the cost of our plastic bottles by approximately $17 million. Due to a very competitive retail environment in 2004, we were unable to pass along the entire increase in raw material and other variable input costs to our customers. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $116.3 million during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to (1) acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $61 million in operating costs; (2) higher fuel costs of which approximately $14 million was related to an increase in fuel prices and (3) an increase in insurance expense due to our claims experience. The increase in sales volumes also contributed to our higher operating expenses. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense, primarily due to more favorable than expected resolution of previously accrued bad debt reserves. These bad debt reserves were recorded for certain customers that experienced economic difficulty and a few large customers that sought bankruptcy protection over the past several years. The Dairy Groups operating expense ratio decreased to 16.1% in 2004 from 17.0% in 2003 due to the effect of increased sales. WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2004 2003 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,010.3 100.0 % $ 598.9 100.0 % Cost of sales 660.3 65.4 386.3 64.5 Gross profit 350.0 34.6 212.6 35.5 Operating costs and expenses 262.6 25.9 209.7 35.0 Total operating income $ 87.4 8.7 % $ 2.9 0.5 % 33 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by $411.4 million, or 68.7%, in 2004 versus 2003. The change in net sales from 2003 to 2004 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2003 Net sales $ 598.9 Acquisitions 232.9 38.9 % Divestitures (4.0 ) (0.7 ) Volume 96.3 16.1 Pricing and product mix 86.2 14.4 2004 Net sales $ 1,010.3 68.7 % The most significant cause of the increase in WhiteWave Foods Companys sales was the acquisition of Horizon Organic effective January 1, 2004, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of the LAND OLAKES cream, sour cream and whipping cream business in the Eastern part of the U.S. effective March 31, 2004. Another significant cause of the increase in sales was increased volumes. Volume sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased approximately 16.1% in 2004 due to the success of our brands, particularly Silk and International Delight. We believe increased Silk volumes were due primarily to: (1) increased consumer acceptance of soy products, resulting in increased penetration of soymilk in the club, mass merchandiser and grocery channels; (2) the positive effects of our consumer advertising; and (3) the introduction of new Silk products with nutritional enhancements, new flavors and larger size offerings. We believe the increase in International Delight volumes is due primarily to consumer acceptance of new packaging introduced in 2003 and new low carb flavors introduced in 2004. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales, as we shift our focus toward consumer oriented advertising and marketing, which are recorded as operating expense. These increases were offset slightly by the divestiture in July 2003 of the branded frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations. Cost of goods sold for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $660.3 million in 2004 from $386.3 million in 2003 primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly Class II butterfat and organic soybeans, and the addition of Horizon Organic. The average minimum price of Class II butterfat was 69% higher in 2004 than in 2003. Our average cost of organic soybeans was approximately 40% higher in 2004 than in 2003 primarily due to an increase in domestic organic soybean prices and the utilization of foreign grown organic soybeans, which have a higher price than domestic beans. The cost of sales ratio increased slightly to 65.4% in 2004 from 64.5% in 2003 primarily due to the effect of increased sales. Operating expenses increased approximately $52.9 million in 2004 compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, which we estimate contributed approximately $47 million in costs, and increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $11.5 million to distribution expenses. Marketing spending increased approximately 6% in 2004 as compared to 2003. These increases were somewhat offset by a decline of approximately $16.1 million related to the expiration of the White Wave management incentive plan in March 2004. The operating expense ratio decreased to 25.9% during 2004 from 35.0% during the prior year primarily due to the relatively smaller increase in operating expense dollars compared to the increase in sales dollars. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow During 2005, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $541.0 million for 2005 as compared to $420.7 million for 34 Table of Contents 2004, an increase of $120.3 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was impacted by a decrease in our working capital of $15 million in 2005 compared to an increase of $211.7 million in 2004 due primarily to lower raw milk costs in 2005. In addition, income taxes payable decreased $37.1 million in 2005 compared to a decrease of $10.0 million in 2004 due to the timing of tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $109.8 million in 2005 compared to $723.2 million in 2004, a decrease of $613.4 million. We used approximately $1.8 million for acquisitions and $306.8 million for capital expenditures in 2005 compared to $400.0 million and $333.8 million in 2004, respectively. We received cash proceeds from the sale of operations of $189.9 million in 2005. We used approximately $699.9 million to repurchase our stock during 2005. Set forth in the chart below is a summary of the stock we repurchased in 2005: No. of Shares of Aggregate Average Common Stock Purchase Purchase Price Period Repurchased Price(1) Per Share (Dollars in millions except per share data) July 2005 1,907,100 $ 68.9 $ 36.11 August 2005 3,927,600 140.6 35.80 September 2005 4,091,300 151.8 37.10 October 2005 1,422,500 54.0 37.95 November 2005 5,995,400 224.6 37.46 December 2005 1,537,400 60.0 39.04 18,881,300 $ 699.9 37.07 (1) Includes commissions and fees. We received approximately $73.1 million in 2005 as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. We increased our net borrowings by $175.7 million in 2005 compared to a net borrowing of $441.9 million in 2004. Current Debt Obligations Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. In May 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to lower the interest rate on the revolving credit facility and term loan. With the amendment, both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from 0 to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 5.16% at December 31, 2005. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged $1.625 billion of our borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 4.5%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows: $56.25 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008; $262.5 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2008 through June 30, 2009; and A final payment of $262.5 million on the maturity date of August 13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility until maturity on August 13, 2009. 35 Table of Contents The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or recovery events. In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving credit facility that ranges from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. On November 18, 2005, we amended our senior credit facility to change the maximum leverage covenant to 4.35 to 1.00 through March 31, 2007 and 4.00 to 1.00 thereafter. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval: (1) the acquired company is involved in the manufacture, processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any other line of business in which we are currently engaged, (2) the net cash purchase price is not greater than $500 million, (3) we acquire at least 51% of the acquired entity, (4) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target and (5) after giving effect to such acquisition on a pro forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of Legacy Deans subsidiaries, and the real property owned by Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The credit agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our credit rating. At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding borrowings of $2.26 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $2.03 billion at December 31, 2004), including $1.5 billion in term loan borrowings and $758.6 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2005, there were $112.1 million of letters of credit under the revolving line that were issued but undrawn. As of March 6, 2006, approximately $568.1 million was outstanding under our senior credit facility. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $600 million receivables backed credit facility, which had $548.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2005 (compared to $500 million at December 31, 2004). The receivables backed facility was fully funded at December 31, 2005. The average interest rate on this facility at December 31, 2005 was 4.6%. Approximately $516.1 million was outstanding under this facility at March 6, 2006. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our receivables backed facility. Our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility and receivables backed credit facility increased from 2004 to 2005 primarily to fund our share repurchases. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2005 also included $600 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Legacy Deans senior notes, a $40.9 million line of credit at our Spanish subsidiary and approximately $20.5 million face value of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 36 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness, purchase and lease obligations at December 31, 2005.

(2) Primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes, including organic soybeans and organic raw milk. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process. (3) Includes fixed rate interest obligations as well as interest on our variable rate debt based on the rates and balances in effect at December 31, 2005. Interest that may be due in the future on the variable rate portion of our senior credit facility will vary based on the interest rate in effect at the time and the borrowings outstanding at the time. Other Long Term Liabilities We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan also may impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension and postretirement costs also may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation and annual periodic pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits, changes in obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. In 2005, we recorded non cash pension expense of $11.5 million, of which $8.0 million was attributable to periodic expense and $3.5 million was attributable to settlements compared to a total of $9.8 million in 2004, of which $1.8 million was attributable to settlements. These amounts were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. 37 Table of Contents The assumed discount rate was 5.75% at December 31, 2004 and 2005. In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations and fiscal year end disclosure, an analysis is performed in which the duration of projected cash flows from defined benefit and retiree health care plans are matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available. We use the results of the yield curve analysis to select the discount rate that matches the duration and payment stream of the benefits in each plan. Each rate is rounded to the nearest quarter of a percent. In selecting the assumed rate of return on plan assets, we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan, as well as our investment allocation policy and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We rebalance the investments when the allocation is not within the target range. The results are adjusted for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe these assumptions are appropriate based upon the mix of investments and the long term nature of the plans investments. Plan asset returns were $14.1 million in 2005, a $2.9 million increase from plan asset returns of $11.2 million in 2004. Net periodic pension expense for our plans is expected to decrease in 2006 to approximately $9.5 million due primarily to the increase in assets from $165.3 million as of December 31, 2004 to $190.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Based on current projections, 2006 funding requirements will be approximately $25.8 million as compared to $34.1 million for 2005. The postretirement benefit plans are not funded. Based on current projections, 2006 cash requirements to pay benefits for our other postretirement benefit obligations will remain at approximately $2.6 million, the same as the 2005 cash requirements. We were required to recognize an additional minimum liability for certain pension plans as prescribed by SFAS No. 87 and SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Postretirement Benefits. The accumulated other comprehensive income component of the additional minimum liability, which totaled $18.5 million ($11.8 million net of tax), was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity through a charge to Other Comprehensive Income, and did not affect net income for 2005. The charge to Other Comprehensive Income will be reversed in future periods to the extent the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation. See Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Other Commitments and Contingencies On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Legacy Dean, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments we make under this note, if any, will be expensed as incurred. We also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation, investigations and audits: certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested; certain lease obligations, which require us to guarantee the minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease; and selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. 38 Table of Contents See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations. Future Capital Requirements During 2006, we intend to invest a total of approximately $260 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. The lower amount from the prior year reflects the completion of several major capital projects in 2005. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations. We intend to spend this amount as follows: Operating Division Amount (In millions) Dairy Group $ 164 WhiteWave Foods Company 81 Other 15 Total $ 260 In 2006, we expect cash interest to be approximately $195 million based on current debt levels and cash taxes to be approximately $120 million. We expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. As of March 6, 2006, approximately $568.1 million was available for future borrowings under our senior credit facility. Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs Dairy Group The primary raw material used in our Dairy Group is raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat). The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw milk, and those prices change on a monthly basis. The regulated minimum prices differ based on how the raw milk is utilized. Raw milk processed into fluid milk is priced at the Class I price, and raw milk processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream is priced at the Class II price. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain producer premiums (or over order premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw milk costs, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in our raw milk costs can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. Because our Class II products typically have a higher fat content than that contained in raw milk, we also purchase bulk cream for use in some of our Class II products. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Another significant raw material used by our Dairy Group is resin, which is used to make plastic bottles. Resin is a petroleum based product and the price of resin generally has increased recently due to increases in crude oil prices. Our Dairy Group purchases approximately four million gallons of diesel fuel per month to operate our extensive direct store delivery system. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices that it charges for Class I dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw milk, packaging, fuel and other materials fluctuate. Prices for some Class II products are also changed monthly while others are changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, especially in the case of Class II butterfat because Class II butterfat prices for each month are not announced by the government until after the end of that month. Also, in some cases we are competitively or contractually constrained with the means and timing of implementing price changes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margin fluctuate with the price of our raw materials and other inputs. 39 Table of Contents In 2004, our Dairy Group was adversely affected by extreme volatility in the prices of raw skim milk, butterfat and cream. In 2005, prices for raw skim milk, butterfat and cream were more stable than in 2004 but remained high. We expect raw milk, butterfat and cream prices to decrease slightly over the first two quarters of 2006. However, raw milk, butterfat and cream prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. Due to the disruption in production caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the prices of resin and fuel have increased dramatically and resin supplies have from time to time been insufficient to meet demand. We are undertaking all reasonable measures in an attempt to secure an adequate resin supply; however, there can be no assurance that we will always be successful in our attempts. We expect prices of both resin and diesel fuel to remain high throughout 2006. WhiteWave Foods Company A significant raw material used to manufacture products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company is organic soybeans. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs for 2006. Generally, these agreements provide for pricing at fixed levels. However, should our need for organic soybeans exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we would be required to pay likely would be significantly higher. The increase in soymilk consumption combined with the increased demand for organic soybeans in cattle feed has put pressure on the supply of organic soybeans and there is a risk of significant upward pressure on organic soybean prices. Another significant raw material used in our organic products is organic raw milk. Organic raw milk is not readily available and the growth of our organic dairy business depends on us being able to procure sufficient quantities of organic raw milk in time to meet our needs. We obtain our supply of organic raw milk by entering into one to two year agreements with farmers pursuant to which the farmers agree to sell us specified quantities of organic raw milk for fixed prices for the duration of the agreement. The industry wide demand for organic raw milk has exceeded supply, resulting in our inability to fully meet customer demand. As a result at times we are forced to limit quantities we ship to our customers. We expect to continue to limit quantities available to customers of organic milk into the second quarter of 2006. Also, as our contracts with farmers expire, we are generally required to agree to higher prices to renew as a result of increased competition for organic raw milk supply. The increase in the demand for organic milk combined with competitive activity and a limited supply has put significant upward pressure on organic raw milk costs. Competitive Environment There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery industry in recent years, and this trend is continuing. As our customer base consolidates, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers or gain new customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. Many of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current intensely competitive environment. Over the past few years, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group segment, which reduced our profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend to continue. In bidding situations we are subject to the risk of losing certain customers altogether. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have contracts with many of our largest customers, and most of the contracts that we do have are generally terminable at will by the customer. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail level have caused competition to become increasingly intense at the processor level. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. 40 Table of Contents Tax Rate In 2005, our tax rate on continuing operations was 37.9%. We estimate the effective tax rate for 2006 will be in the range of 38% to 38.5%. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, adoption of SFAS 123(R) related to expensing of stock options, as well as recent and proposed changes to federal and state tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates. Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Accounts Receivable We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. As these factors change, our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $22.1 million, or approximately 2.6% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2005. The allowance for doubtful accounts, expressed as a percent of accounts receivable, was approximately 2.9% at December 31, 2004. Each 0.10% change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately $867,000. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Substantially all of our qualified pension plans are consolidated into one master trust. We retained investment consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to help our Investment Committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust. Our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at 65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. At December 31, 2005, our master trust was invested as follows: equity securities and limited partnerships 71%; fixed income securities 27%; and cash and cash equivalents 2%. We determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plans investments based on target allocations of the pension plans investments. Additionally, we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plans investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other investments. The resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.5%. While a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature, including assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and mortality 41 Table of Contents rates, generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption reflect current market conditions. As such, our discount rate likely will change more frequently than in prior years. The discount rate utilized to determine our estimated future benefit obligations remained the same at 5.75% at December 31, 2004 and 2005. A 0.25% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $470,000 and $360,000, respectively. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $161,000. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.61 billion as of December 31, 2005 resulting primarily from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. We believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support. Perpetual trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. A reporting unit can be a segment or an operating division. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges for perpetual trademarks or goodwill during 2005. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period, which could have an impact on our earnings. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our valuation allowance decreased $481,000 in 2005 in anticipation of the expected realization of net operating loss carryforwards that were previously reserved. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are 42 Table of Contents developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $161.2 million and $143.0 million, respectively, including both current and long term liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations in March 2005. This Interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and also clarifies when an entity should have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. We adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2005. We recognized expense of $1.6 million, net of tax, in 2005 as a cumulative change in accounting principle as a result of adopting the standard. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment in December 2004. It will require the cost of employee compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based on grant date fair values. That cost will be recognized over the vesting period. SFAS No. 123(R) became effective for us in the first quarter of 2006. As permitted under the Statement we will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) retroactively. The historical pro forma expense we have reported will be the expense applied for our retroactive adoption of the Statement. Refer to the section titled Stock Based Compensation in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for an illustration of the pro forma impact of expensing our stock options in the historical periods. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. SFAS No. 151, which is effective for inventory costs incurred during years beginning after June 15, 2005, clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the rule in APB No. 29 which excluded from fair value measurement exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead SFAS No. 153 excludes from fair value measurement exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2005: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 $ 625 4.81% to 4.84% December 2007 500 4.07% to 4.27% December 2010 500 43 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2004: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 5.20% to 6.74% December 2005 $ 400 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 375 We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our credit facilities falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We incurred $8.5 million of additional interest expense, net of taxes, during 2005 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt falling below the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote because the counter parties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2005, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to the pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 44 Table of Contents
