Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs. The Dairy Group generally increases or decreases the prices of its fluid dairy products on a monthly basis in correlation to fluctuations in the costs of raw materials, packaging supplies and delivery costs. However, in some cases, we are competitively or contractually constrained with respect to the means and or timing of price increases. This can have a negative impact on the Dairy Groups profitability. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. From 1990 through 2001, the dairy industry experienced significant consolidation, led by us. Consolidation has resulted in lower operating costs, less excess capacity and greater efficiency. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 10% from 1990 to the end of 2005, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors seek to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic and significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. For more information about our Dairy Group, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. WhiteWave Foods Company WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers, LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products and Rachels Organic dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells The Organic Cow organic dairy products, White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu and Hersheys milks and milkshakes. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales totaled approximately $1.28 billion in 2006, or approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including 3 Table of Contents grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. The following charts graphically depict WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales by brand and by channel: (1) Includes Horizon Organic and The Organic Cow organic dairy products. (2) Includes Hersheys milk and milk shakes and White Wave and Tofu Town tofu. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products including sales to its largest customer (Wal Mart including its subsidiaries, such as Sams Club, which accounted for approximately 14.3% of WhiteWave Foods Companys 2006 net sales) are sold pursuant to customer purchase orders or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. In 2006, approximately 75% of the products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company were manufactured in facilities operated by either WhiteWave Foods Company or our Dairy Group. The remaining 25% were manufactured by third party manufacturers under processing agreements. WhiteWave Foods Company currently operates seven manufacturing facilities, including three facilities that were previously operated by our Dairy Group. The majority of WhiteWave Foods Companys products are delivered by common carrier to customer warehouses, although some products are distributed through third party distributors or through our Dairy Groups DSD system. The primary raw material used in our soy based products is organic soybeans. Organic soybeans are generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these products. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs in 2007. These agreements provide pricing at fixed levels. The primary raw material used in our organic milk based products is organic raw milk. We currently purchase organic raw milk from a network of over 360 dairy farmers across the United States. We also produce certain of our own organic raw milk needs in the U.S. at two organic farms that we own and operate and an additional farm that we lease and have contracted with a third party to manage. We generally enter into supply agreements with dairy farmers with typical terms of one to two years, which obligate us to purchase certain minimum quantities. In the recent past, the industry wide demand for organic raw milk has generally exceeded supply, resulting in our inability to fully meet customer demand. However, we expect that our efforts to foster increased supply and overall industry supply growth will ease the historical shortfall in supply over the near term. We are currently taking steps to increase consumer demand for our products to avoid a meaningful oversupply of raw organic milk; however, there can be no assurance that the supply of raw organic milk in the market will not exceed demand in an amount that could exert downward pricing pressure on the sale of our products and negatively impact our profitability. The primary raw material used in our LAND OLAKES and other non organic dairy products is raw milk. We purchase raw milk from farmers cooperatives, typically pursuant to requirements contracts (with no minimum purchase obligation). Raw milk is generally readily available. The minimum price of raw milk is regulated in most parts of the country by the federal government. Several states also regulate raw milk pricing through their own programs. Other raw materials used in WhiteWave Foods Companys products, such as flavorings, organic sugar and packaging materials, are generally available from several suppliers and we are not dependent on any single supplier for these materials. Certain of these raw materials are purchased 4 Table of Contents under long term contracts in order to obtain lower costs. The prices of raw materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand. For more information, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance of the product compared to its competitors. Also, in some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. For more information about WhiteWave Foods Company, see Part II Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Current Business Strategy Lead Growth in The Dairy Category As the largest dairy processor in the United States, our Dairy Group is in a unique position to provide unmatched service, convenience and value to our customers. We are intently focused on maintaining and extending our Dairy Groups leadership position by focusing on our customer needs. In 2006, our Dairy Groups fresh milk volumes were up 1.9% compared to total U.S. consumption growth of approximately 1%, according to data published by the US Department of Agriculture. We believe this increase in market share is an indication of the success of our strategy. In 2007, we will maintain our focus on the highest level of service, quality and value. Drive Efficiencies and Productivity to Fund Growth In 2006, we began a multi year project designed to extend our Dairy Groups competitive advantage through leveraging of our nation wide purchasing power, as well as a realignment of our finance and accounting organization. As part of this project, we announced that we hired a Chief Procurement Officer in December 2006. In 2007, we will continue to evaluate our purchasing activities with a focus on reducing costs through consolidated purchase agreements. Throughout 2007, we will transition our finance and transaction personnel into regional accounting and transaction centers, improving the consistency, quality and cost of these activities. Fully Leverage our Selling Systems, Especially DSD Our Dairy Group operations include one of the largest refrigerated DSD networks in the United States. In addition to products manufactured within our Dairy Group facilities, we utilize the DSD network to deliver products manufactured by WhiteWave Foods Company, as well as third party products. In 2007, we will continue to focus on leveraging our DSD capabilities including the expansion of fresh fluid organic milk and single serve products. Bring Innovation to the Category Given our relative strength in people, facilities and customer base, we have an opportunity to bring product innovation to the dairy case. In 2006, we significantly expanded the distribution of Rbst Free dairy products, further expanding our product line to meet customer demand for healthy nutritional products. In 2007, we will introduce a new Silk Plus line of products. This extension of the Silk product line will feature additional fortifications designed to offer specific health benefits. 5 Table of Contents Maximize the Performance of WhiteWave Foods Company In 2004, we began the process of consolidating the operations of the three operating units that comprise our WhiteWave Foods segment into a single business. We are building a vertically integrated branded business with a focused product portfolio, efficient manufacturing processes and an efficient distribution system. During 2005, we completed the consolidation of our sales, marketing and research and development organization and began the process of integrating our supply chain. We consolidated most product manufacturing into five primary facilities, three of which were transferred from our Dairy Group, and we narrowed our network of co packers. Further, we began building a leadership team with significant experience in growing a branded products company. In 2006, we focused on streamlining our product portfolio, focusing on our most profitable long term opportunities, and on continuing to optimize our supply chain. In addition, in 2006 we installed the Silk and Horizon Organic brands and a portion of our plant network onto the SAP enterprise operating software platform. We expect to complete the installation of the remainder of our brands and production facilities in 2007. The implementation of the SAP platform across WhiteWave Foods Company will enable us to more effectively and efficiently manage our supply chain and business processes. Developments Since January 1, 2006 Discontinued Operations Our former Iberian operations included the manufacture and distribution of private label and branded milk across Spain and Portugal. In the second quarter of 2006, we committed to a plan to sell our Iberian operations with the expectation that such sale could be completed within one year. At that time, we recognized a non cash impairment charge of $46.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, representing our best estimate as of June 30, 2006 of the impairment required based on our expected proceeds upon sale of the Iberian operations. On September 14, 2006, we completed the sale of our operations in Spain for net cash proceeds of approximately $96.0 million. In addition to customary indemnifications of the purchaser of the business, we retained contingent obligations related to regulatory compliance, including an obligation to pay the purchaser a maximum of 15 million euros (approximately $19.8 million as of December 31, 2006) if certain regulatory approvals are not received with respect to a specific facility. A loss on the sale of our operations in Spain of $6.8 million (net of tax) was recognized during 2006. In connection with the sale of our operations in Spain, we entered into an agreement to sell our Portuguese operations (that comprised the remainder of our Iberian operations) for approximately $11.4 million subject to regulatory approvals and working capital adjustments. We completed the sale of our Portuguese operations in January 2007. No significant loss is expected on the sale. The Iberian operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Management Changes On April 27, 2006, we announced Jack F. Callahan Jr. as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He began his employment in May 2006. Previously, Mr. Callahan served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Development at PepsiCo, where he oversaw all corporate strategy and merger and acquisition activity. On November 21, 2006, we announced Harrald Kroeker as our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Dairy Group. Previously, Mr. Kroeker served in multiple executive capacities at Pepsi Bottling Group most recently as Vice President and General Manager, Great West Business Unit. On December 12, 2006, we announced Bradley J. Holcomb as our Senior Vice President and Chief Procurement Officer, Dairy Group. Previously, Mr. Holcomb served as Senior Vice President of Global Materials and Supply at Royal Group Technologies Limited. On February 22, 2007, we announced Blaine E. McPeak as our President, Horizon Organic. Previously, Mr. McPeak served as President of Kellogg Companys Wholesome Portable Breakfast and Snacks division. 6 Table of Contents Stock Repurchases Between February 1 and December 31, 2006, we spent approximately $399.9 million to repurchase 10.0 million shares of our common stock for an average price of $39.90 per share, excluding commissions and fees. On May 3, 2006, and again on November 29, 2006, our Board of Directors authorized increases in our stock repurchase program in the aggregate amount of $600 million. At February 23, 2007, approximately $218.7 million remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities In 2006, we recorded a charge of $25.1 million as part of our ongoing costs savings initiative. We recorded a charge of $23.0 million related to our Dairy Group operations for the closing of three Dairy Group facilities and other previously announced plans. We also recorded a charge of $2.1 million related to the previously announced reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company. We expect to incur additional charges related to all of these restructuring plans of approximately $15.4 million, primarily in 2007. A significant portion of the 2007 charges relate to the realignment of our Dairy Groups finance and accounting organization. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown, such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. Dean Foods Company Senior Notes On May 17, 2006, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes mature on June 1, 2016 and interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2006. The indenture under which we issued the senior unsecured notes does not contain financial covenants but does contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness, enter into sale leaseback transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility and any other secured debt we may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries that are guarantors under our senior credit facility, which are substantially all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. We used all of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce a corresponding amount of borrowings under our senior credit facility. Employees As of December 31, 2006, we had the following employees: No. of % of Employees Total Dairy Group 24,828 94 % WhiteWave Foods Company 1,311 5 Corporate 209 1 Total 26,348 100 % 7 Table of Contents Approximately 35% of the Dairy Groups and 38% of WhiteWave Foods Companys employees participate in collective bargaining agreements. Government Regulation Public Health As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA: regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell, and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorize regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. We use quality control laboratories in our manufacturing facilities to test raw ingredients. Product quality and freshness are essential to the successful distribution of our products. To monitor product quality at our facilities, we maintain quality control programs to test products during various processing stages. We believe our facilities and manufacturing practices comply with all material government regulations. Employee Safety Regulations We are subject to certain safety regulations, including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations. Environmental Regulations We are subject to various environmental regulations. Ammonia, a refrigerant used extensively in our operations, is considered an extremely hazardous substance pursuant to U.S. federal environmental laws due to its toxicity. Also, certain of our facilities discharge biodegradable wastewater into municipal waste treatment facilities in excess of levels permitted under local regulations. As a result, certain of our subsidiaries are required to pay wastewater surcharges or to construct wastewater pretreatment facilities. To date, such wastewater surcharges have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain above ground or underground petroleum storage tanks at many of our facilities. These tanks are periodically inspected to determine compliance with applicable regulations. We are required to make expenditures from time to time in order to maintain compliance of these tanks. To date, such expenditures have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, we recognized a liability of $2.8 million as of December 31, 2005, representing the estimated future cost of removing certain underground fuel storage tanks. As we generally have ceased construction of new underground fuel storage tanks, the impact of this Interpretation was not material in 2006 and we do not anticipate the impact to be material in future periods. We believe that we are in material compliance with the environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect environmental compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the foreseeable future. 8 Table of Contents Milk Industry Regulation The federal government establishes minimum prices that we must pay to producers in federally regulated areas for raw milk. Raw milk contains primarily raw skim milk, in addition to a small percentage of butterfat. The federal government establishes separate minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat. Raw milk delivered to our facilities is tested to determine the percentage of butterfat, and we pay our suppliers separate prices for the raw skim milk and butterfat based on the results of these tests. The federal governments minimum prices are calculated by economic formula based on supply and demand and vary depending on the processors geographic location or sales area and the type of product manufactured using the raw product. Federal minimum prices change monthly. Class I butterfat and raw skim milk prices (which are the minimum prices we are required to pay for butterfat and raw skim milk that is processed into milk) and Class II raw skim milk prices (which are the prices we are required to pay for raw skim milk that is processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams, creamers, ice cream and sour cream) for each month are announced by the federal government by the 23rd day of the immediately preceding month. Class II butterfat prices for each month are announced on or before the fifth day after the end of that month. Some states have established their own rules for determining minimum prices for raw milk. In addition to the federal or state minimum prices, we also pay producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. A few states also have retail pricing requirements. Organic Regulations Our organic products are required to meet the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. These regulations require strict methods of production for organic food products and limit the ability of food processors to use non organic or synthetic materials in the production of organic foods or in the raising of organic livestock. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business. 9 Table of Contents Brief History We commenced operations in 1988 through a predecessor entity. Our original operations consisted solely of a packaged ice business. Since then the following activity has occurred: December 1993 Acquired Suiza Dairy Corporation, a regional dairy processor located in Puerto Rico. We then began acquiring other local and regional U.S. dairy processors, growing our dairy business rapidly primarily through acquisitions. April 1996 Completed our initial public offering under our former name Suiza Foods Corporation and began trading on NASDAQ National Market. January 1997 Completed a secondary offering. March 1997 Began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. August 1997 Acquired Franklin Plastics, Inc., a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling plastic containers. After the acquisition, we began acquiring other companies in the plastic packaging industry. November 1997 Acquired Morningstar Foods Inc., whose business was a predecessor to our WhiteWave Foods Company. This was our first acquisition of a company with national brands. April 1998 Sold our packaged ice operations. May 1998 Acquired Continental Can Company, making us one of the largest plastic packaging companies in the United States. July 1999 Sold all of our U.S. plastic packaging operations to Consolidated Container Company in exchange for cash and a minority interest in the purchaser. January 2000 Acquired Southern Foods Group, L.P., the third largest dairy processor in the United States, making us the largest dairy processor in the country. February 2000 Acquired Leche Celta, one of the largest dairy processors in Spain. March and May 2000 Sold our European packaging operations. December 2001 Acquired Dean Foods Company (Legacy Dean) and changed our name from Suiza Foods Corporation to Dean Foods Company. Legacy Dean changed its name to Dean Holding Company. May 2002 Acquired the portion of White Wave, Inc. that we did not already own. January 2004 Acquired the portion of Horizon Organic that we did not already own. 2005 Consolidated our nationally branded business, including White Wave, Horizon Organic and Dean National Brand Group into a single operating unit called WhiteWave Foods Company. June 2005 Spun off our Specialty Foods Group segment to our shareholders. September 2006 Sold our Leche Celta operations in Spain. January 2007 Sold our Leche Celta operations in Portugal. Minority Holdings We own an approximately 25% interest, on a fully diluted basis, in Consolidated Container Company (CCC), one of the nations largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. We have owned a minority interest in CCC since July 1999 when we sold our U.S. plastic packaging operations to CCC. Vestar Capital Partners controls CCC through a majority ownership interest. Less than 1% of CCC is owned indirectly by Alan Bernon, President of our Dairy Group and a member of our Board of Directors, and his brother Peter Bernon. Pursuant to our agreements with Vestar, we control two of the eight seats on CCCs Management Committee. We also have entered into various supply agreements with CCC pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase certain of our requirements for plastic bottles and bottle components from CCC. In 2006, we spent approximately $284.4 million on products purchased from CCC. Because CCC has 10 Table of Contents issued certain senior notes, CCC files annual, quarterly and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about CCC can be found on its website at www.cccllc.com or in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available at www.sec.gov.

During 2005, we appointed a new President of WhiteWave Foods Company, which was a key step in the development of a consolidated leadership team for the organization. We also completed the consolidation of the sales, marketing and research and development organization and began the process of integrating our supply chain. We consolidated most product manufacturing into five primary facilities, three of which were transferred from our Dairy Group in 2005, and we narrowed our network of co packers. In 2006, we focused on streamlining our product portfolio, focusing on the most profitable opportunities, and on continuing to optimize our supply chain. On January 1, 2006, we transferred our Rachels Organic business in the United Kingdom from our former International division to WhiteWave Foods Company. In addition, in 2006 we installed the Silk and Horizon Organic brands and a portion of our plant network onto the SAP enterprise operating software platform. We expect to complete the installation of the remainder of our brands and production facilities in 2007. The implementation of the SAP platform across WhiteWave Foods Company will enable us to more effectively and efficiently manager our supply chain and business processes. Our failure to successfully manage this process could cause us to incur unexpected costs or to lose customers or sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Reorganization of Our Dairy Group Segment Could Temporarily Adversely Affect the Performance of the Segment In 2006, we started the process of realigning our Dairy Group segment in order to further streamline our organization, improve efficiency within our operations and better meet the needs of our customers. We are currently focused on reorganizing our purchasing, finance and other administrative functions to better leverage our scale, which we expect will enable us to more effectively and efficiently manage our business processes. Furthermore, we are in the process of consolidating our information technology systems, including the implementation of standard accounting and distribution software packages. Our failure to successfully manage this process could cause us to incur unexpected costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The Consolidation of Retail Customers May Put Pressures on Our Operating Margins and Profitability Our customers such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power. These customers may use shelf space currently used for our products for their private label products. If we fail to respond to these trends, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase promotional spending for our products, any of which would adversely affect our profitability. Availability and Changes in Raw Material and Other Input Costs Can Adversely Affect Us Raw skim milk is the most significant raw material that we use in our Dairy Group. Organic raw milk, organic soybeans and sugar are significant inputs utilized by WhiteWave Foods Company. The prices of these materials increase and decrease based on supply and demand, and in some cases, governmental regulation. Weather also affects the availability and pricing of these inputs. In many cases we are able to adjust our pricing to reflect changes in raw material costs. Volatility in the cost of our raw materials can adversely affect our performance as price changes often lag changes in costs. These lags tend to erode our profit margins. Furthermore, cost increases may exceed the price increases we are able to pass along to our customers. Extremely high raw material costs also can put downward pressure on our margins and our volumes. We expect certain raw material prices, including raw skim milk prices, to increase in 2007. In the recent past, the industry wide demand for organic raw milk has generally exceeded supply, resulting in our inability to fully meet customer demand. However, our efforts to foster increased supply have increased overall industry supply which has eased the historical shortfall in supply. We are currently taking steps to increase consumer demand for our products to avoid a meaningful oversupply of raw organic milk; however, there can be no 12 Table of Contents assurance that the supply of raw organic milk in the market will not exceed demand in an amount that could exert downward pricing pressure on the sale of our products and negatively impact our profitability. Because our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to customers through its direct store delivery system, we are a large consumer of fuel. Similarly, our WhiteWave Foods business is impacted by the costs of petroleum based products through the use of common carriers in delivering their products. The Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of resin, which is the primary component used in our plastic bottles. Resin supplies have from time to time been insufficient to meet demand. Over the first nine months of 2006, the prices of resin and fuel increased before decreasing over the last three months of the year. Increases in fuel and resin prices can adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, a disruption in our ability to secure an adequate resin supply could adversely affect our operations. Our Products Could Attract Increased Competitive Activity, Which Could Impede Our Growth Rate and Cost Us Sales Our Silk soymilk and Horizon Organic organic food and beverage products have leading market shares in their categories and have benefited in many cases from being the first to introduce products in their categories. As soy and organic products continue to gain in popularity with consumers, we expect our products in these categories to continue to attract competitors. Many large food and beverage companies have substantially more resources than we do, and they may be able to market their soy and organic products more successfully than us, which could cause our growth rate in these categories to be slower than our forecast and could cause us to lose sales. The increase in popularity of soy and organic milks is also attracting private label competitors who sell their products at a lower price. The success of private label brands could adversely affect our sales and profitability. The willingness of consumers to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products providing the right consumer benefits at the right price. Furthermore, in periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other lower priced products which could result in a reduction of sales. Our International Delight coffee creamer competes intensely with Nestl CoffeeMate business, and our Hersheys milks and milkshakes compete intensely with Nestl Nesquik. Nestle has significantly greater resources than we do, which allows them to promote their products more aggressively. Our failure to successfully compete with Nestle could have a material adverse effect on the sales and profitability of our International Delight and or our Hersheys businesses. We May Experience Liabilities or Negative Effects on Our Reputation as a Result of Product Recalls, Product Injuries or Other Legal Claims We sell products for human consumption, which involves a number of legal risks. Product contamination, spoilage or other adulteration, product misbranding or product tampering could require us to recall products. We also may be subject to liability if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or in the event our products cause injury, illness or death. In addition, we advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including consumer protection statutes of some states. A significant product liability or other legal judgment against us or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our profitability. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or is not merited, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. Changes in Laws, Regulations and Accounting Standards Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Financial Results We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and numerous related regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in federal, state or local laws, or the interpretations of such laws and regulations may negatively impact our financial results or our ability to market our products. 13 Table of Contents Loss of Rights to Any of Our Licensed Brands Could Adversely Affect Our Sales and Profits We sell certain of our products under licensed brand names such as Borden, Hersheys, LAND OLAKES, Pet, and others. In some cases, we have invested significant capital in product development and marketing and advertising related to these licensed brands. Should our rights to manufacture and sell products under any of these names be terminated for any reason, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We Have Substantial Debt and Other Financial Obligations and We May Incur Even More Debt We have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. See Part II Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. We have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our debt level and related debt service obligations: require us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions, impose on us additional financial and operational restrictions, and expose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. The interest rate on certain of our debt is based on our debt rating, as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. We have no ability to control the ratings issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys. A downgrade in our debt rating could cause our interest rate to increase, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve our targeted profitability level, as well as our cash flow. Our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could adversely impact our net income. If we do not comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants under our credit facilities, we may default under them. Upon default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations.

Legal Proceedings We are not party to, nor are our properties the subject of, any material pending legal proceedings. However, we are parties from time to time to certain claims, litigation, audits and investigations. We believe that we have established adequate reserves to satisfy any potential liability we may have under all such claims, litigations, audits and investigations that are currently pending. In our opinion, the settlement of any such currently pending or threatened matter is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Two shareholder derivative complaints were filed in July and October 2006 in the district court of Dallas County, Texas, which allege stock option backdating. The complaints name certain current and former members of the Board of Directors and certain current and former members of management. In response to the litigation, a special litigation committee of our Board of Directors was established in August 2006. The Committee has conducted its own independent review of our stock option grants and the allegations made in the complaints. The committee consists of independent board members not named in the litigation. This Committee has determined that there were no fraudulent acts by management. The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) is conducting an informal inquiry into our stock option practices. We are cooperating fully with the SECs inquiry. Item 4.

In order to enhance comparability among all periods presented, we elected to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified retrospective approach. Under this transition method, the results for prior periods reflect the recognition of the compensation expense and related income tax benefit historically disclosed in our financial statements. For financial reporting purposes, share based compensation expense is included within the same financial statement caption where the recipients cash compensation is reported. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified retrospective approach, our net income was reduced by $18.9 million, $31.7 million, $34.2 million and $31.2 million in 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. (2) In 2006, we reclassified the presentation of expense recognition for reusable packaging utilized in the distribution of our products from cost of sales to distribution expense. The reclassification reduced cost of sales and increased distribution expense by $42.0 million, $36.2 million, $27.5 million and $22.1 million in 2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The reclassification had no impact on net income. (3) Results for 2004 include a gain of $5.9 million primarily related to the settlement of litigation. Results for 2003 include a gain of $66.2 million on the sale of our frozen pre whipped topping and frozen creamer operations and a gain of $2.5 million related to the divestiture of 11 facilities in 2001 in connection with our acquisition of Dean Holding Company. (4) Results for 2004 include a charge of $32.6 million to write off deferred financing costs related to the refinancing of our senior credit facility. (5) In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. (FIN) 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. If FIN 47 had always been in effect, we would have expensed this amount for depreciation in periods prior to January 1, 2005. (6) For purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, earnings represents income before income taxes plus fixed charges. Fixed charges consist of interest on all debt, amortization of deferred financing costs and the portion of rental expense that we believe is representative of the interest component of rent expense. (7) Includes the current portion of long term debt. (8) The balance at December 31, 2006 reflects a $14.8 million reduction related to the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). The reduction had no impact on net income. 20 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview We are a leading food and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the United States. The Dairy Group manufactures and sells its products under a variety of local and regional brand names and under private labels. Our WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers, LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products and Rachels Organic dairy products. Dairy Group Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment, with approximately 87% of our consolidated net sales in 2006. Our Dairy Group manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream, cultured dairy products and juices to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across the United States. Due to the perishable nature of the Dairy Groups products, our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to its customers stores in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a direct store delivery or DSD system and we believe we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by the Dairy Groups corporate sales department. Most of the Dairy Groups customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. From 1990 through 2001, the dairy industry experienced significant consolidation, led by us. Consolidation has resulted in lower operating costs, less excess capacity and greater efficiency. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 10% from 1990 to the end of 2005, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume sales growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic and significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation, and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. WhiteWave Foods Company WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers, LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products and Rachels Organic dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells The Organic Cow organic dairy products, White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu and Hersheys milks and milkshakes. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the WhiteWave Foods Companys customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from WhiteWave Foods Company either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance 21 Table of Contents of the product compared to its competitors. In some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Recent Developments Discontinued Operations Our former Iberian operations included the manufacture and distribution of private label and branded milk across Spain and Portugal. We entered the Iberian market in February 2000 prior to the merger of Suiza Foods Corporation and Dean Foods Company, which occurred in December 2001, when we believed that opportunities for domestic expansion appeared limited. With the emergence of the WhiteWave Foods Company platform and additional growth opportunities within our domestic Dairy Group, our primary focus has been on our domestic operations. Accordingly, with the change in our strategic focus, we concluded that there are other organizations that may be better positioned to take advantage of the Iberian market. In the second quarter of 2006, we committed to a plan to sell our Iberian operations with the expectation that such sale could be completed within one year. At that time, we recognized a non cash impairment charge of $46.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, representing our best estimate as of June 30, 2006 of the impairment required based on our expected proceeds upon sale of the Iberian operations. On September 14, 2006, we completed the sale of our operations in Spain for net cash proceeds of approximately $96.0 million. In addition to customary indemnifications of the purchaser of the business, we retained contingent obligations related to regulatory compliance, including an obligation to pay the purchaser a maximum of 15 million euros (approximately $19.8 million as of December 31, 2006) if certain regulatory approvals are not received with respect to a specific facility. A loss on the sale of our operations in Spain of $6.8 million (net of tax) was recognized during 2006. In connection with the sale of our operations in Spain, we entered into an agreement to sell our Portuguese operations (that comprised the remainder of our Iberian operations) for approximately $11.4 million subject to regulatory approvals and working capital settlements. We completed the sale of our Portuguese operations in January 2007. No significant loss is expected on the sale. The Iberian operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Acquisitions In February 2007, our Dairy Group entered into an agreement to acquire Friendship Dairies, Inc., a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of cultured dairy products primarily in the northeastern United States. This transaction will expand our cultured dairy product capabilities and add a strong regional brand. The purchase price will be approximately $130 million, including the costs of the acquisition. We expect to complete the transaction by the second quarter of 2007, subject to regulatory approval. Management Changes On April 27, 2006, we announced Jack F. Callahan Jr. as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He began his employment in May 2006. Previously, Mr. Callahan served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Development at PepsiCo, where he oversaw all corporate strategy and merger and acquisition activity. On November 21, 2006, we announced Harrald Kroeker as our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Dairy Group. Previously, Mr. Kroeker served in multiple executive capacities at Pepsi Bottling Group most recently as Vice President and General Manager, Great West Business Unit. 22 Table of Contents On December 12, 2006, we announced Bradley J. Holcomb as our Senior Vice President and Chief Procurement Officer, Dairy Group. Previously, Mr. Holcomb served as Senior Vice President of Global Materials and Supply at Royal Group Technologies Limited. On February 22, 2007, we announced Blaine E. McPeak as our President, Horizon Organic. Previously, Mr. McPeak served as President of Kellogg Companys Wholesome Portable Breakfast and Snacks division. Stock Repurchases Between February 1 and December 31, 2006, we spent approximately $399.9 million to repurchase 10.0 million shares of our common stock for an average price of $39.90 per share, excluding commissions and fees. On May 3, 2006, and again on November 29, 2006 our Board of Directors authorized increases in our stock repurchase program in the aggregate amount of $600 million. At February 23, 2007, approximately $218.7 million remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities In 2006, we recorded a charge of $25.1 million as part of our ongoing costs savings initiative. We recorded a charge of $23.0 million related to our Dairy Group operations for the closing of three Dairy Group facilities and other previously announced plans. We also recorded a charge of $2.1 million related to the previously announced reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company. We expect to incur additional charges related to all of these restructuring plans of approximately $15.4 million, primarily in 2007. A significant portion of the 2007 charges relate to the realignment of our Dairy Groups finance and accounting organization. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown, such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. Dean Foods Company Senior Notes On May 17, 2006, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes mature on June 1, 2016 and interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2006. The indenture under which we issued the senior unsecured notes does not contain financial covenants but does contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness, enter into sale leaseback transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility and any other secured debt we may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries that are guarantors under our senior credit facility, which are substantially all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. We used all of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce a corresponding amount of borrowings under our senior credit facility. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain information concerning our financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales.

Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Cost of sales decreased by 24 Table of Contents approximately 3.1% to $7.36 billion in 2006 from $7.59 billion in 2005 primarily due to lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group, partly offset by increased volumes at the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company and higher commodity costs at WhiteWave Foods Company. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 72.9% in 2006 compared to 74.6% in 2005 primarily due to the impact of lower raw milk prices and higher volumes. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $86.1 million, or approximately 4.3%, during 2006 versus the prior year. Significant changes to operating expenses include the following: Distribution costs increased approximately $60.1 million due to increased volumes and higher fuel costs partly offset by distribution efficiencies at WhiteWave Foods Company; General and administrative expenses at our Dairy Group were approximately $24.2 million higher than last year, primarily due to higher information technology spending and higher salaries and benefits; Marketing costs increased approximately $10.2 million due to higher spending at WhiteWave Foods Company and our Dairy Group; Bad debt expense decreased $10.6 million compared to 2005. The expense in 2005 was higher due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the write off of a receivable from a large customer; and Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $10.3 million lower than 2005. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our facility closing and reorganization activities. Our operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.7% for 2006 as compared to 19.7% for 2005, partly due to lower net sales resulting from lower raw milk costs. Operating Income For the reasons noted above, operating income was $650.7 million in 2006, an increase of $70.6 million from 2005 operating income of $580.1 million. Our operating margin was 6.4% in 2006 compared to 5.7% in 2005. Other (Income) Expense Interest expense increased to $194.5 million in 2006 from $160.2 million in 2005 primarily due to higher interest rates, including higher interest rates on our $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on May 17, 2006, and higher average debt outstanding. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.5% in 2006 compared to 39.0% in 2005. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. In 2006, our income tax rate was positively impacted by the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Results by Segment Dairy Group The key performance indicators of our Dairy Group segment are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,821.0 100.0 % $ 8,973.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,529.3 74.0 6,809.5 75.9 Gross profit 2,291.7 26.0 2,163.9 24.1 Operating costs and expenses 1,613.7 18.3 1,521.9 16.9 Total operating income $ 678.0 7.7 % $ 642.0 7.2 % 25 Table of Contents Our Dairy Groups net sales decreased approximately $152.4 million, or 1.7%, in 2006 versus 2005. The change in net sales from 2005 to 2006 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2005 Net sales $ 8,973.4 Acquisitions 8.0 0.1 % Volume 133.0 1.5 Pricing and product mix (293.4 ) (3.3 ) 2006 Net sales $ 8,821.0 (1.7 )% The decrease in the Dairy Groups net sales was due to lower raw milk costs, partly offset by increased volumes. The decrease in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily resulted from decreased pricing due to the pass through of lower raw milk costs in 2006. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials and other variable costs fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not always reflect the entire increase in raw material and other input costs that we may experience. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2006 compared to 2005: Year Ended December 31* 2006 2005 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1),(2) $ 7.47 $ 8.54 (13 )% Class I butterfat mover(1),(3) 1.34 1.76 (24 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(2),(4) 7.35 7.74 (5 ) Class II butterfat minimum(3),(4) 1.33 1.72 (23 ) * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Materials and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. Volume sales of all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased 1.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Volume sales of fresh milk, which were approximately 69% of the Dairy Groups 2006 volumes, were up approximately 1.9% for the year compared to USDA data showing a 1.0% increase in total consumption of milk in the U.S. during the year. Our Dairy Group acquired Jilbert Dairy in July 2006, which we estimate contributed an additional $8.0 million in net sales during 2006. Our Dairy Groups cost of sales decreased to $6.53 billion in 2006 compared to $6.81 billion in 2005 primarily due to lower raw milk costs, partly offset by increased volumes. The Dairy Groups cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 74.0% in 2006 compared to 75.9% in 2005 primarily due to the impact of lower raw milk costs and higher volumes. 26 Table of Contents Our Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $91.8 million during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to: (1) higher distribution costs of $64.2 million, approximately $15 million of which was due to increased fuel prices and the remaining increase was due to increased volumes, higher salaries and benefits and higher repairs and maintenance costs; (2) higher general and administrative costs of $24.2 million due to higher information technology spending and higher compensation costs and (3) higher marketing costs of $4.1 million. Increases in selling costs were more than offset by lower bad debt expense of $8.1 million compared to 2005 due to higher bad debt expense in 2005 related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the write off of a receivable from a large customer. Our Dairy Groups operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.3% in 2006 from 16.9% in 2005. WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,277.6 100.0 % $ 1,201.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 828.2 64.8 780.4 65.0 Gross profit 449.4 35.2 420.9 35.0 Operating costs and expenses 310.0 24.3 306.0 25.4 Total operating income $ 139.4 10.9 % $ 114.9 9.6 % WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by approximately $76.3 million, or 6.4%, in 2006 versus 2005. The change in net sales from 2005 to 2006 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2005 Net sales $ 1,201.3 Volume 24.6 2.1 % Pricing and product mix 51.7 4.3 2006 Net sales $ 1,277.6 6.4 % The increase in WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales was largely due to higher pricing. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales. Volume growth in our Silk, Horizon Organic, International Delight, LAND OLAKES and Rachels Organic brands was partly offset by the elimination of certain product offerings in late 2005 and early 2006. We believe increased Horizon Organic and Silk volumes were due primarily to increased consumer acceptance and increased marketing efforts. Cost of sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $828.2 million in 2006 from $780.4 million in 2005 primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly organic raw milk and sugar, which increased cost of sales by approximately $41 million and increased volumes. The cost of sales as a percentage of net sales declined to 64.8% in 2006 from 65.0% in 2005 due to increased selling prices and improved product mix, principally driven by the product rationalization in 2006. Operating expenses increased approximately $4.0 million in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher marketing spending of $6.1 million, higher fuel costs of $3.5 million and SAP related costs of $2.9 million, partly offset by increased distribution efficiencies. 27 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 4.6% to $10.17 billion during 2005 from $9.73 billion in 2004. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below.

Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Cost of sales increased by approximately 3.5% to $7.59 billion in 2005 from $7.34 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and increased resin and other commodity costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 74.6% in 2005 compared to 75.5% in 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $151.4 million, or approximately 8.2%, during 2005 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Distribution costs increased approximately $95.2 million due to higher fuel costs and increased volumes at our Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company segments; Incentive compensation costs at our Dairy Group increased approximately $12 million due to improved operating results; Bad debt expense at our Dairy Group increased approximately $9 million in 2005 due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the write off of a receivable from a large customer, as well as the relatively higher level of bad debt recoveries recognized in 2004; Corporate expenses were approximately $10.1 million higher than in 2004, primarily due to higher professional fees of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company, and higher compensation costs, partly offset by lower share based compensation expense; Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $10.9 million higher than 2004. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our facility closing and reorganization activities; and Other operating income declined by approximately $5.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a gain recorded in 2004 related to the settlement of litigation. 28 Table of Contents Our operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.7% for 2005 as compared to 19.0% for 2004. Operating Income Operating income was $580.1 million in 2005, an increase of $44.4 million from 2004 operating income of $535.7 million. Our operating margin was 5.7% in 2005 compared to 5.5% in 2004. Other (Income) Expense Interest expense decreased to $160.2 million in 2005 from $191.8 million in 2004, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amendment in August 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 39.0% in 2005 compared to 40.2% in 2004. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. In 2005, our income tax rate was positively impacted by a favorable tax settlement and the change in expected realization of net operating loss carryforwards. In 2004, our tax rate was negatively impacted by the write off of deferred financing costs that were incurred in a business unit with a lower relative effective tax rate.

The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, which we estimate contributed an additional $35.4 million in sales during 2005. The Dairy Groups cost of sales increased to $6.81 billion in 2005 compared to $6.65 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and an approximately $43 million increase in resin costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs. Resin prices increased primarily due to significant supply constraints resulting from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Resin is the primary raw material in our plastic bottles. The Dairy Groups cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.9% in 2005 compared to 76.5% in 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $83.3 million during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to (1) higher distribution costs of $66.7 million, $31 million of which was due to increased fuel prices and the remaining increase was driven by increased volumes; (2) higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $12 million due to improved operating results and (3) higher bad debt expense. Bad debt expense increased approximately $9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the write off of a receivable from a large customer, as well as the relatively higher level of bad debt recoveries recognized in 2004. The Dairy Groups operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.9% in 2005 from 16.6% in 2004. 30 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income.

The change in net sales from 2004 to 2005 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2004 Net sales $ 1,042.4 Acquisitions 9.2 0.9 % Volume 100.2 9.6 Pricing and product mix 49.5 4.7 2005 Net sales $ 1,201.3 15.2 % Double digit volume growth in our Silk and Horizon Organic brands, combined with somewhat slower growth in International Delight and LAND OLAKES, was partly offset by the elimination of certain product offerings. We believe increased Silk and Horizon Organic volumes were due primarily to increased consumer acceptance and increased marketing efforts. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales. We also benefited from the 2004 acquisition of the LAND OLAKES cream, sour cream, and whipping cream business in the Eastern part of the U.S., which we estimate added $9.2 million to our sales growth. Cost of sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $780.4 million in 2005 from $684.8 million in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly organic raw milk and organic soybeans, which increased cost of sales by approximately $26 million. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales declined to 65.0% in 2005 from 65.7% in 2004 due to the impact of supply chain changes and product rationalization in 2005. Operating expenses increased approximately $36.1 million in 2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $22 million to distribution expenses. Compensation expense also increased as a result of increased staffing levels to support the growth of our organization. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow During 2006, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $561.6 million for 2006 as compared to $541.9 million for 2005, an increase of $19.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was impacted by an increase in our working capital of $86.4 million in 2006 compared to a decrease of $23.4 million in 31 Table of Contents 2005 due primarily to several large obligations that were accrued at the end of 2005 and paid early in 2006. In addition, income taxes payable decreased $11.3 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $37.1 million in 2005 due to the timing of tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $152.3 million in 2006 compared to $90.3 million in 2005, an increase of $62.0 million. We used approximately $17.2 million for acquisitions and $237.2 million for capital expenditures in 2006 compared to $1.4 million and $287.1 million in 2005, respectively. We received cash proceeds from the sale of operations of $96.0 million in 2006 compared to $189.9 million in 2005. We used approximately $400.1 million to repurchase our stock during 2006. Set forth in the chart below is a summary of the stock we repurchased in 2006: No. of Shares of Aggregate Average Common Stock Purchase Purchase Price Period Repurchased Price(1) Per Share(1) (Dollars in millions except per share data) February 2006 400,000 $ 15.4 $ 38.39 May 2006 2,050,800 74.4 36.27 June 2006 1,286,400 45.9 35.71 October 2006 716,100 29.8 41.65 November 2006 3,493,600 145.2 41.55 December 2006 2,075,300 89.4 43.08 10,022,200 $ 400.1 39.92 (1) Includes commissions and fees. We repaid $53.5 million of debt in 2006 compared to a net borrowing of $157.3 million in 2005. We received approximately $32.3 million in 2006, net of minimum withholding taxes paid from cash proceeds, compared to $57.7 million in 2005 as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. Current Debt Obligations Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. Both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from 0 to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 5.99% at December 31, 2006. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged $950.0 million of our borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 4.53%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows: $56.3 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008; $262.5 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2008 through June 30, 2009; and A final payment of $262.5 million on the maturity date of August 13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility until maturity on August 13, 2009. The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or recovery events. 32 Table of Contents In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving credit facility that ranges from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval: (1) the acquired company is involved in the manufacture, processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any other line of business in which we are currently engaged, (2) the net cash purchase price is not greater than $500 million, (3) we acquire at least 51% of the acquired entity, (4) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target and (5) after giving effect to such acquisition on a pro forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of Dean Holding Companys subsidiaries, and the real property owned by Dean Holding Company and its subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The credit agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our credit rating. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding borrowings of $1.76 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $2.26 billion at December 31, 2005), including $1.44 billion in term loan borrowings and $313.5 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2006, there were $136.6 million of letters of credit under the revolving line that were issued but undrawn. As of February 23, 2007, approximately $1.20 billion was outstanding under our senior credit facility. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $600 million receivables backed facility subject to a borrowing base formula. The receivables backed facility had $512.5 million available and drawn at December 31, 2006. The average interest rate on this facility at December 31, 2006 was 5.68%. Approximately $488.4 million was outstanding under this facility at February 23, 2007. Our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility decreased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to our paydown of this facility as a result of our issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes on May 17, 2006, the proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2006 also included $600 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Dean Holding Companys senior notes, $500 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Dean Foods Companys senior notes and approximately $16.0 million of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our indebtedness. 33 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness, purchase and lease obligations at December 31, 2006. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail about our lease and purchase obligations.

(2) Primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes, including organic soybeans and organic raw milk. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process. (3) Includes fixed rate interest obligations as well as interest on our variable rate debt based on the rates and balances in effect at December 31, 2006. Interest that may be due in the future on the variable rate portion of our senior credit facility and receivables backed facility will vary based on the interest rate in effect at the time and the borrowings outstanding at the time. Other Long Term Liabilities We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan also may impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension and postretirement costs also may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation and annual periodic pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits, changes in obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. In 2006, we recorded non cash pension expense of $8.1 million, of which $7.7 million was attributable to periodic expense and $350,000 was attributable to settlements compared to a total of $11.5 million in 2005, of which $3.5 million was attributable to settlements. These amounts were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. 34 Table of Contents The assumed discount rate used to determine plan obligations was 5.85% and 5.75% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations and fiscal year end disclosure, an analysis is performed in which the duration of projected cash flows from defined benefit and retiree health care plans are matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available. We use the results of the yield curve analysis to select the discount rate that matches the duration and payment stream of the benefits in each plan. In selecting the assumed rate of return on plan assets, we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan, as well as our investment allocation policy and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We rebalance the investments when the allocation is not within the target range. The results are adjusted for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe these assumptions are appropriate based upon the mix of investments and the long term nature of the plans investments. Plan asset returns were $24.3 million in 2006, a $10.2 million increase from plan asset returns of $14.1 million in 2005. Net periodic pension expense for our plans is expected to increase in 2007 to approximately $9.5 million. Based on current projections, 2007 funding requirements will be approximately $23.2 million as compared to $37.5 million for 2006. The postretirement benefit plans are not funded. Based on current projections, 2007 cash requirements to pay benefits for our other postretirement benefit obligations will remain at approximately $2.4 million, the same as the 2006 cash requirements. See Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Other Commitments and Contingencies On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Dean Holding Company, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments we make under this note, if any, will be expensed as incurred. We have not breached or terminated any of our milk supply agreements with DFA. We also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation, investigations and audits: certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested; certain lease obligations, which require us to guarantee the minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease; and selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations. 35 Table of Contents Future Capital Requirements During 2007, we intend to invest a total of approximately $250 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility. We intend to spend this amount approximately as follows: Operating Division Amount (In millions) Dairy Group $ 165 WhiteWave Foods Company 80 Corporate 5 Total $ 250 We expect that cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. As of February 23, 2007, approximately $1.20 billion was available for future borrowings under our senior credit facility. Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs Dairy Group The primary raw material used in our Dairy Group is raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat). The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw milk, and those prices change on a monthly basis. The regulated minimum prices differ based on how the raw milk is utilized. Raw milk processed into fluid milk is priced at the Class I price, and raw milk processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream is priced at the Class II price. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain producer premiums (or over order premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw milk costs, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in our raw milk costs can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. Because our Class II products typically have a higher fat content than that contained in raw milk, we also purchase bulk cream for use in some of our Class II products. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Another significant raw material used by our Dairy Group is resin, which is used to make plastic bottles. We purchase approximately 27 million pounds of resin and bottles per month. Resin is a petroleum based product and the price of resin is subject to fluctuations based on changes in crude oil prices. Our Dairy Group purchases approximately four million gallons of diesel fuel per month to operate our extensive direct store delivery system. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices that it charges for Class I dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw milk, packaging, fuel and other materials fluctuate. Prices for some Class II products are also changed monthly while others are changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, especially in the case of Class II butterfat because Class II butterfat prices for each month are not announced by the government until after the end of that month. Also, in some cases we are competitively or contractually constrained with the means and timing of implementing price changes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margin fluctuate with the price of our raw materials and other inputs. In 2005, prices for raw skim milk, butterfat and cream remained high. In 2006, prices for raw skim milk, butterfat and cream declined. We expect raw milk, butterfat and cream prices to increase in 2007. However, raw milk, butterfat and cream prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. 36 Table of Contents During the first nine months of 2006, the prices of resin and fuel increased before decreasing over the last three months of the year. As resin supplies have from time to time been insufficient to meet demand, we are undertaking all reasonable measures to attempt to secure an adequate resin supply; however, there can be no assurance that we will always be successful in our attempts. We expect prices of both resin and diesel fuel to fluctuate throughout 2007. WhiteWave Foods Company A significant raw material used to manufacture products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company is organic soybeans. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs for 2007. These agreements provide for pricing at fixed levels. However, should our need for organic soybeans exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we could be required to pay could be significantly higher. Significant raw materials used in our products include organic raw milk and sugar. We obtain our supply of organic raw milk by entering into one to two year agreements with farmers pursuant to which the farmers agree to sell us specified quantities of organic raw milk for fixed prices for the duration of the agreement. We also source approximately 20% of our organic raw milk supply from our own farms. In the recent past, the industry wide demand for organic raw milk has generally exceeded supply, resulting in our inability to fully meet customer demand. However, we expect that our efforts to foster increased supply and overall industry supply growth will ease the historical shortfall in supply over the near term. We are currently taking steps to increase consumer demand for our products to avoid a meaningful oversupply of raw organic milk; however, there can be no assurance that the supply of raw organic milk in the market will not exceed demand in an amount that could exert downward pricing pressure on the sale of our products and negatively impact our profitability. We also experienced an increase in organic sugar costs in 2006. We have entered into supply agreements for organic sugar, which we believe will meet our needs in 2007. Competitive Environment There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery industry in recent years, and this trend is continuing. As our customer base consolidates, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers or gain new customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. Many of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current intensely competitive environment. Over the past few years, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group segment, which reduced our profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend to continue. In bidding situations we are subject to the risk of losing certain customers altogether. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have contracts with many of our largest customers, and most of the contracts that we do have are generally terminable at will by the customer. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail level have caused competition to become increasingly intense at the processor level. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Tax Rate In 2006, our tax rate on continuing operations was 38.5%. We estimate the effective tax rate for 2007 will be approximately 39%. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as changes to federal and state tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Accounts Receivable We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. As these factors change, our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $17.1 million, or approximately 2.1% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006. The allowance for doubtful accounts, expressed as a percent of accounts receivable, was approximately 2.6% at December 31, 2005. Each 0.10% change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately $816,000. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Substantially all of our qualified pension plans are consolidated into one master trust. We retained investment consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to help our Investment Committee formulate a long term investment policy for the master trust. Our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at 65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. At December 31, 2006, our master trust was invested as follows: equity securities and limited partnerships 71%; fixed income securities 26%; and cash and cash equivalents 3%. We determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plans investments based on target allocations of the pension plans investments. Additionally, we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plans investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other investments. The resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005. While a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature, including assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and mortality rates, generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption reflect current market conditions. As such, our discount rate likely will change more frequently than in prior years. The discount rate utilized to determine our estimated future benefit obligations increased from 5.75% at December 31, 2005 to 5.85% at December 31, 2006. A 0.25% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $585,000 and $363,000, respectively. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $419,000. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.51 billion as of December 31, 2006 resulting primarily from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. We believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support. Perpetual trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Currently, our reporting units are our two segments. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges in continuing operations for goodwill during 2006. As a result of the decision to close a facility and shift customers from one regional brand to another, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $700,000 on a perpetual trademark for a regional brand during 2006. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. We estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period, which could have an impact on our earnings. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $172.9 million and $161.2 million, respectively, including both current and long term liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans) to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its postretirement benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan 39 Table of Contents assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its year end statement of financial position, and provide additional disclosures. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our financial condition at December 31, 2006 has been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 158 did not have an effect on our financial condition at December 31, 2005 or 2004. SFAS No. 158s provisions regarding the change in measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable as we already use a measurement date of December 31 for our postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our postretirement benefit plans and the effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Among its provisions, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we utilized the intrinsic value based method of accounting under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, and adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Under the intrinsic value based method of accounting, compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees and directors was measured as the excess of the quoted market price of common stock at the grant date over the amount the recipient must pay for the stock. Our policy is to grant stock options at fair value on the date of grant and as a result no compensation expense was historically recognized for stock options. As our restricted stock units do not require the recipients to pay for the stock, we have historically recognized compensation expense for the fair value at the date of grant over the vesting period. The fair value for the restricted stock unit grants is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date immediately prior to the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized only for share based payments expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense was recognized based on estimated forfeitures. In order to enhance comparability among all periods presented, we elected to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified retrospective approach. Under this transition method, the results for prior periods reflect the recognition of the compensation expense and related income tax benefit historically disclosed in our financial statements. For financial reporting purposes, share based compensation expense is included within the same financial statement caption where the recipients cash compensation is reported, and is classified as a corporate item for business segment reporting. See Notes 1 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our share based compensation plans and the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the rule in APB No. 29 which excluded from fair value measurement exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead, SFAS No. 153 excludes from fair value measurement exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes in June 2006. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. This interpretation will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2007. 40 Table of Contents The FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements in September 2006. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2008. The FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in February 2007. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2008. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2006: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 4.81% to 4.84% December 2007 $ 500 4.07% to 4.27% December 2010 450 The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2005: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 $ 625 4.81% to 4.84% December 2007 500 4.07% to 4.27% December 2010 500 We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our senior credit facility falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We recorded $7.5 million of interest income, net of taxes, during 2006 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt rising above the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote because the counter parties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to the pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under this risk management strategy if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 42 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Business Overview We are a leading food and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the United States. The Dairy Group manufactures and sells its products under a variety of local and regional brand names and under private labels. Our WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers, LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products and Rachels Organic dairy products. Dairy Group Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment, with approximately 87% of our consolidated net sales in 2006. Our Dairy Group manufactures, markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream, cultured dairy products and juices to retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across the United States. Due to the perishable nature of the Dairy Groups products, our Dairy Group delivers the majority of its products directly to its customers stores in refrigerated trucks or trailers that we own or lease. This form of delivery is called a direct store delivery or DSD system and we believe we have one of the most extensive refrigerated DSD systems in the United States. The Dairy Group sells its products primarily on a local or regional basis through its local and regional sales forces, although some national customer relationships are coordinated by the Dairy Groups corporate sales department. Most of the Dairy Groups customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from the Dairy Group either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. The dairy industry is a mature industry that has traditionally been characterized by slow to flat growth, low profit margins, fragmentation and excess capacity. Excess capacity resulted from the development of more efficient manufacturing techniques, the establishment of captive dairy manufacturing operations by some grocery retailers and declining demand for fluid milk products. From 1990 through 2001, the dairy industry experienced significant consolidation, led by us. Consolidation has resulted in lower operating costs, less excess capacity and greater efficiency. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), per capita consumption of fluid milk and cream decreased by over 10% from 1990 to the end of 2005, although total consumption has remained relatively flat over the same period due to population increases. Therefore, volume sales growth across the industry generally remains flat to modest, profit margins generally remain low and excess manufacturing capacity continues to exist. In this environment, price competition is particularly intense, as smaller processors struggle to retain enough volume to cover their fixed costs. In response to this dynamic and significant competitive pressure caused by the ongoing consolidation among food retailers, many processors, including us, are now placing an increased emphasis on product differentiation, and cost reduction in an effort to increase consumption, sales and margins. Our Dairy Group has several competitors in each of our major product and geographic markets. Competition between dairy processors for shelf space with retailers is based primarily on price, service and quality, while competition for consumer sales is based on a variety of factors such as brand recognition, price, taste preference and quality. Dairy products also compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. WhiteWave Foods Company WhiteWave Foods Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and dairy related products such as Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon Organic dairy products, International Delight coffee creamers, LAND OLAKES creamers and fluid dairy products and Rachels Organic dairy products. WhiteWave Foods Company also sells The Organic Cow organic dairy products, White Wave and Tofu Town branded tofu and Hersheys milks and milkshakes. We license the LAND OLAKES and Hersheys names from third parties. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers, including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores, mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets. WhiteWave Foods Company sells its products through its internal sales force and through independent brokers. Most of the WhiteWave Foods Companys customers, including its largest customer, purchase products from WhiteWave Foods Company either by purchase order or pursuant to contracts that are generally terminable at will by the customer. WhiteWave Foods Company has several competitors in each of its product markets. Competition to obtain shelf space with retailers for a particular product is based primarily on the expected or historical sales performance 21 Table of Contents of the product compared to its competitors. In some cases, WhiteWave Foods Company pays fees to retailers to obtain shelf space for a particular product. Competition for consumer sales is based on many factors, including brand recognition, price, taste preferences and quality. Consumer demand for soy and organic foods has grown rapidly in recent years due to growing consumer confidence in the health benefits of soy and organic foods, and WhiteWave Foods Company has a leading position in the soy and organic foods category. However, our soy and organic food products compete with many other beverages and nutritional products for consumer sales. Recent Developments Discontinued Operations Our former Iberian operations included the manufacture and distribution of private label and branded milk across Spain and Portugal. We entered the Iberian market in February 2000 prior to the merger of Suiza Foods Corporation and Dean Foods Company, which occurred in December 2001, when we believed that opportunities for domestic expansion appeared limited. With the emergence of the WhiteWave Foods Company platform and additional growth opportunities within our domestic Dairy Group, our primary focus has been on our domestic operations. Accordingly, with the change in our strategic focus, we concluded that there are other organizations that may be better positioned to take advantage of the Iberian market. In the second quarter of 2006, we committed to a plan to sell our Iberian operations with the expectation that such sale could be completed within one year. At that time, we recognized a non cash impairment charge of $46.4 million, net of an income tax benefit of $8.1 million, representing our best estimate as of June 30, 2006 of the impairment required based on our expected proceeds upon sale of the Iberian operations. On September 14, 2006, we completed the sale of our operations in Spain for net cash proceeds of approximately $96.0 million. In addition to customary indemnifications of the purchaser of the business, we retained contingent obligations related to regulatory compliance, including an obligation to pay the purchaser a maximum of 15 million euros (approximately $19.8 million as of December 31, 2006) if certain regulatory approvals are not received with respect to a specific facility. A loss on the sale of our operations in Spain of $6.8 million (net of tax) was recognized during 2006. In connection with the sale of our operations in Spain, we entered into an agreement to sell our Portuguese operations (that comprised the remainder of our Iberian operations) for approximately $11.4 million subject to regulatory approvals and working capital settlements. We completed the sale of our Portuguese operations in January 2007. No significant loss is expected on the sale. The Iberian operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Acquisitions In February 2007, our Dairy Group entered into an agreement to acquire Friendship Dairies, Inc., a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of cultured dairy products primarily in the northeastern United States. This transaction will expand our cultured dairy product capabilities and add a strong regional brand. The purchase price will be approximately $130 million, including the costs of the acquisition. We expect to complete the transaction by the second quarter of 2007, subject to regulatory approval. Management Changes On April 27, 2006, we announced Jack F. Callahan Jr. as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He began his employment in May 2006. Previously, Mr. Callahan served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Development at PepsiCo, where he oversaw all corporate strategy and merger and acquisition activity. On November 21, 2006, we announced Harrald Kroeker as our Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Dairy Group. Previously, Mr. Kroeker served in multiple executive capacities at Pepsi Bottling Group most recently as Vice President and General Manager, Great West Business Unit. 22 Table of Contents On December 12, 2006, we announced Bradley J. Holcomb as our Senior Vice President and Chief Procurement Officer, Dairy Group. Previously, Mr. Holcomb served as Senior Vice President of Global Materials and Supply at Royal Group Technologies Limited. On February 22, 2007, we announced Blaine E. McPeak as our President, Horizon Organic. Previously, Mr. McPeak served as President of Kellogg Companys Wholesome Portable Breakfast and Snacks division. Stock Repurchases Between February 1 and December 31, 2006, we spent approximately $399.9 million to repurchase 10.0 million shares of our common stock for an average price of $39.90 per share, excluding commissions and fees. On May 3, 2006, and again on November 29, 2006 our Board of Directors authorized increases in our stock repurchase program in the aggregate amount of $600 million. At February 23, 2007, approximately $218.7 million remained available under our stock repurchase authorization. Facility Closing and Reorganization Activities In 2006, we recorded a charge of $25.1 million as part of our ongoing costs savings initiative. We recorded a charge of $23.0 million related to our Dairy Group operations for the closing of three Dairy Group facilities and other previously announced plans. We also recorded a charge of $2.1 million related to the previously announced reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Company. We expect to incur additional charges related to all of these restructuring plans of approximately $15.4 million, primarily in 2007. A significant portion of the 2007 charges relate to the realignment of our Dairy Groups finance and accounting organization. These charges include the following costs: Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions; Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to prepare abandoned facilities for closure; Costs incurred after shutdown, such as lease obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes; Costs associated with the reorganization of WhiteWave Foods Companys supply chain and distribution activities; and Write downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets, primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value and held for sale. Dean Foods Company Senior Notes On May 17, 2006, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior unsecured notes. The senior unsecured notes mature on June 1, 2016 and interest is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning December 1, 2006. The indenture under which we issued the senior unsecured notes does not contain financial covenants but does contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness, enter into sale leaseback transactions and engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. The notes are senior unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility and any other secured debt we may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the subsidiaries that are guarantors under our senior credit facility, which are substantially all of our wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries other than our receivables securitization subsidiaries. We used all of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to reduce a corresponding amount of borrowings under our senior credit facility. 23 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents certain information concerning our financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 2004 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 10,098.6 100.0 % $ 10,174.7 100.0 % $ 9,725.5 100.0 % Cost of sales 7,358.7 72.9 7,591.5 74.6 7,338.1 75.5 Gross profit 2,739.9 27.1 2,583.2 25.4 2,387.4 24.5 Operating costs and expenses: Selling and distribution 1,648.9 16.3 1,581.0 15.5 1,472.1 15.1 General and administrative 409.2 4.1 380.5 3.7 355.8 3.7 Amortization of intangibles 6.0 0.1 6.1 0.1 5.1 0.1 Facility closing and reorganization costs 25.1 0.2 35.5 0.4 24.6 0.2 Other operating income (5.9 ) (0.1 ) Total operating costs and expenses 2,089.2 20.7 2,003.1 19.7 1,851.7 19.0 Total operating income $ 650.7 6.4 % $ 580.1 5.7 % $ 535.7 5.5 % Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales decreased approximately 0.7% to $10.10 billion during 2006 from $10.17 billion in 2005. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below. Net Sales $ Increase/ % Increase/ 2006 2005 (Decrease) (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Dairy Group $ 8,821.0 $ 8,973.4 $ (152.4 ) (1.7 )% WhiteWave Foods Company 1,277.6 1,201.3 76.3 6.4 Total $ 10,098.6 $ 10,174.7 $ (76.1 ) (0.7 ) The change in net sales was due to the following: Change in Net Sales 2006 vs. 2005 Pricing, Volume Total and Product Increase/ Acquisitions Mix Changes (Decrease) (In millions) Dairy Group $ 8.0 $ (160.4 ) $ (152.4 ) WhiteWave Foods Company 76.3 76.3 Total $ 8.0 $ (84.1 ) $ (76.1 ) Net sales decreased approximately $76.1 million during 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group, partly offset by volume growth at the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company and increased pricing at WhiteWave Foods Company. Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Cost of sales decreased by 24 Table of Contents approximately 3.1% to $7.36 billion in 2006 from $7.59 billion in 2005 primarily due to lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group, partly offset by increased volumes at the Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company and higher commodity costs at WhiteWave Foods Company. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 72.9% in 2006 compared to 74.6% in 2005 primarily due to the impact of lower raw milk prices and higher volumes. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $86.1 million, or approximately 4.3%, during 2006 versus the prior year. Significant changes to operating expenses include the following: Distribution costs increased approximately $60.1 million due to increased volumes and higher fuel costs partly offset by distribution efficiencies at WhiteWave Foods Company; General and administrative expenses at our Dairy Group were approximately $24.2 million higher than last year, primarily due to higher information technology spending and higher salaries and benefits; Marketing costs increased approximately $10.2 million due to higher spending at WhiteWave Foods Company and our Dairy Group; Bad debt expense decreased $10.6 million compared to 2005. The expense in 2005 was higher due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the write off of a receivable from a large customer; and Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $10.3 million lower than 2005. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our facility closing and reorganization activities. Our operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 20.7% for 2006 as compared to 19.7% for 2005, partly due to lower net sales resulting from lower raw milk costs. Operating Income For the reasons noted above, operating income was $650.7 million in 2006, an increase of $70.6 million from 2005 operating income of $580.1 million. Our operating margin was 6.4% in 2006 compared to 5.7% in 2005. Other (Income) Expense Interest expense increased to $194.5 million in 2006 from $160.2 million in 2005 primarily due to higher interest rates, including higher interest rates on our $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued on May 17, 2006, and higher average debt outstanding. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 38.5% in 2006 compared to 39.0% in 2005. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. In 2006, our income tax rate was positively impacted by the settlement of certain state and federal tax matters. Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Results by Segment Dairy Group The key performance indicators of our Dairy Group segment are sales volumes, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 8,821.0 100.0 % $ 8,973.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 6,529.3 74.0 6,809.5 75.9 Gross profit 2,291.7 26.0 2,163.9 24.1 Operating costs and expenses 1,613.7 18.3 1,521.9 16.9 Total operating income $ 678.0 7.7 % $ 642.0 7.2 % 25 Table of Contents Our Dairy Groups net sales decreased approximately $152.4 million, or 1.7%, in 2006 versus 2005. The change in net sales from 2005 to 2006 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2005 Net sales $ 8,973.4 Acquisitions 8.0 0.1 % Volume 133.0 1.5 Pricing and product mix (293.4 ) (3.3 ) 2006 Net sales $ 8,821.0 (1.7 )% The decrease in the Dairy Groups net sales was due to lower raw milk costs, partly offset by increased volumes. The decrease in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily resulted from decreased pricing due to the pass through of lower raw milk costs in 2006. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials and other variable costs fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not always reflect the entire increase in raw material and other input costs that we may experience. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2006 compared to 2005: Year Ended December 31* 2006 2005 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1),(2) $ 7.47 $ 8.54 (13 )% Class I butterfat mover(1),(3) 1.34 1.76 (24 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(2),(4) 7.35 7.74 (5 ) Class II butterfat minimum(3),(4) 1.33 1.72 (23 ) * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Materials and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. Volume sales of all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased 1.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. Volume sales of fresh milk, which were approximately 69% of the Dairy Groups 2006 volumes, were up approximately 1.9% for the year compared to USDA data showing a 1.0% increase in total consumption of milk in the U.S. during the year. Our Dairy Group acquired Jilbert Dairy in July 2006, which we estimate contributed an additional $8.0 million in net sales during 2006. Our Dairy Groups cost of sales decreased to $6.53 billion in 2006 compared to $6.81 billion in 2005 primarily due to lower raw milk costs, partly offset by increased volumes. The Dairy Groups cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 74.0% in 2006 compared to 75.9% in 2005 primarily due to the impact of lower raw milk costs and higher volumes. 26 Table of Contents Our Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $91.8 million during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to: (1) higher distribution costs of $64.2 million, approximately $15 million of which was due to increased fuel prices and the remaining increase was due to increased volumes, higher salaries and benefits and higher repairs and maintenance costs; (2) higher general and administrative costs of $24.2 million due to higher information technology spending and higher compensation costs and (3) higher marketing costs of $4.1 million. Increases in selling costs were more than offset by lower bad debt expense of $8.1 million compared to 2005 due to higher bad debt expense in 2005 related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina and the write off of a receivable from a large customer. Our Dairy Groups operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 18.3% in 2006 from 16.9% in 2005. WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2006 2005 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,277.6 100.0 % $ 1,201.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 828.2 64.8 780.4 65.0 Gross profit 449.4 35.2 420.9 35.0 Operating costs and expenses 310.0 24.3 306.0 25.4 Total operating income $ 139.4 10.9 % $ 114.9 9.6 % WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by approximately $76.3 million, or 6.4%, in 2006 versus 2005. The change in net sales from 2005 to 2006 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2005 Net sales $ 1,201.3 Volume 24.6 2.1 % Pricing and product mix 51.7 4.3 2006 Net sales $ 1,277.6 6.4 % The increase in WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales was largely due to higher pricing. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales. Volume growth in our Silk, Horizon Organic, International Delight, LAND OLAKES and Rachels Organic brands was partly offset by the elimination of certain product offerings in late 2005 and early 2006. We believe increased Horizon Organic and Silk volumes were due primarily to increased consumer acceptance and increased marketing efforts. Cost of sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $828.2 million in 2006 from $780.4 million in 2005 primarily due to the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly organic raw milk and sugar, which increased cost of sales by approximately $41 million and increased volumes. The cost of sales as a percentage of net sales declined to 64.8% in 2006 from 65.0% in 2005 due to increased selling prices and improved product mix, principally driven by the product rationalization in 2006. Operating expenses increased approximately $4.0 million in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher marketing spending of $6.1 million, higher fuel costs of $3.5 million and SAP related costs of $2.9 million, partly offset by increased distribution efficiencies. 27 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Consolidated Results Net Sales Consolidated net sales increased approximately 4.6% to $10.17 billion during 2005 from $9.73 billion in 2004. Net sales by segment are shown in the table below.

Cost of Sales All expenses incurred to bring a product to completion are included in cost of sales, such as raw material, ingredient and packaging costs; labor costs; and plant and equipment costs, including costs to operate and maintain our coolers and freezers. In addition, our Dairy Group includes costs associated with transporting our finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution facilities. Cost of sales increased by approximately 3.5% to $7.59 billion in 2005 from $7.34 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and increased resin and other commodity costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in our Dairy Group. Our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 74.6% in 2005 compared to 75.5% in 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. Operating Costs and Expenses Our operating expenses increased approximately $151.4 million, or approximately 8.2%, during 2005 versus the prior year. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the following: Distribution costs increased approximately $95.2 million due to higher fuel costs and increased volumes at our Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company segments; Incentive compensation costs at our Dairy Group increased approximately $12 million due to improved operating results; Bad debt expense at our Dairy Group increased approximately $9 million in 2005 due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the write off of a receivable from a large customer, as well as the relatively higher level of bad debt recoveries recognized in 2004; Corporate expenses were approximately $10.1 million higher than in 2004, primarily due to higher professional fees of approximately $11 million, primarily related to the reorganization of our WhiteWave Foods Company, and higher compensation costs, partly offset by lower share based compensation expense; Net facility closing and reorganization costs that were approximately $10.9 million higher than 2004. See Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our facility closing and reorganization activities; and Other operating income declined by approximately $5.9 million in 2005 compared to 2004 due to a gain recorded in 2004 related to the settlement of litigation. 28 Table of Contents Our operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 19.7% for 2005 as compared to 19.0% for 2004. Operating Income Operating income was $580.1 million in 2005, an increase of $44.4 million from 2004 operating income of $535.7 million. Our operating margin was 5.7% in 2005 compared to 5.5% in 2004. Other (Income) Expense Interest expense decreased to $160.2 million in 2005 from $191.8 million in 2004, primarily due to a charge of $32.6 million in 2004 to write off deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facility amendment in August 2004. Income Taxes Income tax expense was recorded at an effective rate of 39.0% in 2005 compared to 40.2% in 2004. Our effective tax rate varies based on the relative earnings of our business units. In 2005, our income tax rate was positively impacted by a favorable tax settlement and the change in expected realization of net operating loss carryforwards. In 2004, our tax rate was negatively impacted by the write off of deferred financing costs that were incurred in a business unit with a lower relative effective tax rate.

Volume sales of all Dairy Group products, excluding the impact of acquisitions, increased 1.8% in 2005 compared to 2004. Volume sales of fresh milk, which were approximately 68% of the Dairy Groups 2005 volumes, were up approximately 2.5% for the year compared to USDA data showing a relatively flat total consumption of milk in the U.S. during the year. The increase in the Dairy Groups net sales due to pricing and product mix shown in the above table primarily resulted from increased pricing due to the pass through of increased fuel and packaging costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs in 2005. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices it charges customers for fluid dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw materials and other variable costs fluctuate. Because of competitive pressures, the price increases do not always reflect the entire increase in raw material and other input costs that we 29 Table of Contents may experience. The following table sets forth the average monthly Class I mover and average monthly Class II minimum prices for raw skim milk and butterfat for 2005 compared to 2004: Year Ended December 31* 2005 2004 % Change Class I raw skim milk mover(1),(2) $ 8.54 $ 8.44 1 % Class I butterfat mover(1),(3) 1.76 1.95 (10 ) Class II raw skim milk minimum(2),(4) 7.74 6.90 12 Class II butterfat minimum(3),(4) 1.72 2.06 (17 ) * The prices noted in this table are not the prices that we actually pay. The minimum prices applicable at any given location for Class I raw skim milk or Class I butterfat are based on the Class I mover plus a location differential. Class II prices noted in the table are federal minimum prices, applicable at all locations. Our actual cost also includes producer premiums, procurement costs and other related charges that vary by location and vendor. Please see Part I Item 1. Business Government Regulation Milk Industry Regulation and Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Materials and Other Inputs for a more complete description of raw milk pricing. (1) We process Class I raw skim milk and butterfat into fluid milk products. (2) Prices are per hundredweight. (3) Prices are per pound. (4) We process Class II raw skim milk and butterfat into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream. The Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama in October 2004, which we estimate contributed an additional $35.4 million in sales during 2005. The Dairy Groups cost of sales increased to $6.81 billion in 2005 compared to $6.65 billion in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and an approximately $43 million increase in resin costs, partly offset by lower raw milk costs. Resin prices increased primarily due to significant supply constraints resulting from the Gulf Coast hurricanes. Resin is the primary raw material in our plastic bottles. The Dairy Groups cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.9% in 2005 compared to 76.5% in 2004 primarily due to the impact of higher volumes and efficiencies gained through our facility rationalization activities. The Dairy Groups operating expenses increased approximately $83.3 million during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to (1) higher distribution costs of $66.7 million, $31 million of which was due to increased fuel prices and the remaining increase was driven by increased volumes; (2) higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $12 million due to improved operating results and (3) higher bad debt expense. Bad debt expense increased approximately $9 million in 2005 compared to the prior year due to the impact of Hurricane Katrina, the write off of a receivable from a large customer, as well as the relatively higher level of bad debt recoveries recognized in 2004. The Dairy Groups operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased to 16.9% in 2005 from 16.6% in 2004. 30 Table of Contents WhiteWave Foods Company The key performance indicators of WhiteWave Foods Company are net sales dollars, gross profit and operating income. Year Ended December 31 2005 2004 Dollars Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 1,201.3 100.0 % $ 1,042.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 780.4 65.0 684.8 65.7 Gross profit 420.9 35.0 357.6 34.3 Operating costs and expenses 306.0 25.4 269.9 25.9 Total operating income $ 114.9 9.6 % $ 87.7 8.4 % WhiteWave Foods Companys net sales increased by approximately $158.9 million, or 15.2%, in 2005 versus 2004. The change in net sales from 2004 to 2005 was due to the following: Dollars Percent (Dollars in millions) 2004 Net sales $ 1,042.4 Acquisitions 9.2 0.9 % Volume 100.2 9.6 Pricing and product mix 49.5 4.7 2005 Net sales $ 1,201.3 15.2 % Double digit volume growth in our Silk and Horizon Organic brands, combined with somewhat slower growth in International Delight and LAND OLAKES, was partly offset by the elimination of certain product offerings. We believe increased Silk and Horizon Organic volumes were due primarily to increased consumer acceptance and increased marketing efforts. Higher pricing also contributed to the increase in sales. The two primary drivers of this increase were (1) increased selling prices in response to increased commodity costs and (2) a decline in slotting fees, couponing and certain other promotional costs that are required to be recorded as reductions of net sales. We also benefited from the 2004 acquisition of the LAND OLAKES cream, sour cream, and whipping cream business in the Eastern part of the U.S., which we estimate added $9.2 million to our sales growth. Cost of sales for WhiteWave Foods Company increased to $780.4 million in 2005 from $684.8 million in 2004 primarily due to increased volumes and the impact of higher raw material costs, particularly organic raw milk and organic soybeans, which increased cost of sales by approximately $26 million. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales declined to 65.0% in 2005 from 65.7% in 2004 due to the impact of supply chain changes and product rationalization in 2005. Operating expenses increased approximately $36.1 million in 2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased volumes and higher fuel costs which together contributed approximately $22 million to distribution expenses. Compensation expense also increased as a result of increased staffing levels to support the growth of our organization. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historical Cash Flow During 2006, we met our working capital needs with cash flow from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $561.6 million for 2006 as compared to $541.9 million for 2005, an increase of $19.7 million. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was impacted by an increase in our working capital of $86.4 million in 2006 compared to a decrease of $23.4 million in 31 Table of Contents 2005 due primarily to several large obligations that were accrued at the end of 2005 and paid early in 2006. In addition, income taxes payable decreased $11.3 million in 2006 compared to an increase of $37.1 million in 2005 due to the timing of tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $152.3 million in 2006 compared to $90.3 million in 2005, an increase of $62.0 million. We used approximately $17.2 million for acquisitions and $237.2 million for capital expenditures in 2006 compared to $1.4 million and $287.1 million in 2005, respectively. We received cash proceeds from the sale of operations of $96.0 million in 2006 compared to $189.9 million in 2005. We used approximately $400.1 million to repurchase our stock during 2006. Set forth in the chart below is a summary of the stock we repurchased in 2006: No. of Shares of Aggregate Average Common Stock Purchase Purchase Price Period Repurchased Price(1) Per Share(1) (Dollars in millions except per share data) February 2006 400,000 $ 15.4 $ 38.39 May 2006 2,050,800 74.4 36.27 June 2006 1,286,400 45.9 35.71 October 2006 716,100 29.8 41.65 November 2006 3,493,600 145.2 41.55 December 2006 2,075,300 89.4 43.08 10,022,200 $ 400.1 39.92 (1) Includes commissions and fees. We repaid $53.5 million of debt in 2006 compared to a net borrowing of $157.3 million in 2005. We received approximately $32.3 million in 2006, net of minimum withholding taxes paid from cash proceeds, compared to $57.7 million in 2005 as a result of stock option exercises and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan. Current Debt Obligations Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility provides for a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan. Both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest, at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from 0 to 25 basis points depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys), or LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 50 to 150 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The blended interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was 5.99% at December 31, 2006. However, we had interest rate swap agreements in place that hedged $950.0 million of our borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate of 4.53%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period. Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows: $56.3 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2006 through September 30, 2008; $262.5 million quarterly beginning on December 31, 2008 through June 30, 2009; and A final payment of $262.5 million on the maturity date of August 13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $1.5 billion revolving credit facility until maturity on August 13, 2009. The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or recovery events. 32 Table of Contents In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving credit facility that ranges from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our credit ratings (as issued by Standard & Poors and Moodys). The senior credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval: (1) the acquired company is involved in the manufacture, processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any other line of business in which we are currently engaged, (2) the net cash purchase price is not greater than $500 million, (3) we acquire at least 51% of the acquired entity, (4) the transaction is approved by the Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the target and (5) after giving effect to such acquisition on a pro forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens, investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the capital stock of Dean Holding Companys subsidiaries, and the real property owned by Dean Holding Company and its subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains standard default triggers, including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement, default on certain of our other debt, certain other material adverse changes in our business, and a change in control. The credit agreement does not contain any default triggers based on our credit rating. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding borrowings of $1.76 billion under our senior credit facility (compared to $2.26 billion at December 31, 2005), including $1.44 billion in term loan borrowings and $313.5 million outstanding under the revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2006, there were $136.6 million of letters of credit under the revolving line that were issued but undrawn. As of February 23, 2007, approximately $1.20 billion was outstanding under our senior credit facility. In addition to our senior credit facility, we also have a $600 million receivables backed facility subject to a borrowing base formula. The receivables backed facility had $512.5 million available and drawn at December 31, 2006. The average interest rate on this facility at December 31, 2006 was 5.68%. Approximately $488.4 million was outstanding under this facility at February 23, 2007. Our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility decreased from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to our paydown of this facility as a result of our issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes on May 17, 2006, the proceeds of which were used to repay borrowings under our senior credit facility. Other indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2006 also included $600 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Dean Holding Companys senior notes, $500 million face value of outstanding indebtedness under Dean Foods Companys senior notes and approximately $16.0 million of capital lease and other obligations. See Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our indebtedness. 33 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our obligations for indebtedness, purchase and lease obligations at December 31, 2006.

(2) Primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes, including organic soybeans and organic raw milk. We enter into these contracts from time to time to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients. In addition, we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process. (3) Includes fixed rate interest obligations as well as interest on our variable rate debt based on the rates and balances in effect at December 31, 2006. Interest that may be due in the future on the variable rate portion of our senior credit facility and receivables backed facility will vary based on the interest rate in effect at the time and the borrowings outstanding at the time. Other Long Term Liabilities We offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates. For example, these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets. Our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Changes made to the provisions of the plan also may impact current and future pension costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods. Pension and postretirement costs also may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation and annual periodic pension costs. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits, changes in obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. In 2006, we recorded non cash pension expense of $8.1 million, of which $7.7 million was attributable to periodic expense and $350,000 was attributable to settlements compared to a total of $11.5 million in 2005, of which $3.5 million was attributable to settlements. These amounts were determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. 34 Table of Contents The assumed discount rate used to determine plan obligations was 5.85% and 5.75% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In order to select a discount rate for purposes of valuing the plan obligations and fiscal year end disclosure, an analysis is performed in which the duration of projected cash flows from defined benefit and retiree health care plans are matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available. We use the results of the yield curve analysis to select the discount rate that matches the duration and payment stream of the benefits in each plan. In selecting the assumed rate of return on plan assets, we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan, as well as our investment allocation policy and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We rebalance the investments when the allocation is not within the target range. The results are adjusted for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe these assumptions are appropriate based upon the mix of investments and the long term nature of the plans investments. Plan asset returns were $24.3 million in 2006, a $10.2 million increase from plan asset returns of $14.1 million in 2005. Net periodic pension expense for our plans is expected to increase in 2007 to approximately $9.5 million. Based on current projections, 2007 funding requirements will be approximately $23.2 million as compared to $37.5 million for 2006. The postretirement benefit plans are not funded. Based on current projections, 2007 cash requirements to pay benefits for our other postretirement benefit obligations will remain at approximately $2.4 million, the same as the 2006 cash requirements. See Notes 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding retirement plans and other postretirement benefits. Other Commitments and Contingencies On December 21, 2001, in connection with our acquisition of Dean Holding Company, we issued a contingent, subordinated promissory note to Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) in the original principal amount of $40 million. DFA is our primary supplier of raw milk, and the promissory note is designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities until 2021, or be paid for the loss of that business. The promissory note has a 20 year term and bears interest based on the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash, but will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up to a maximum principal amount of $96 million. We may prepay the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire at the end of 20 years, without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or interest. Payments we make under this note, if any, will be expensed as incurred. We have not breached or terminated any of our milk supply agreements with DFA. We also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities, in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation, investigations and audits: certain indemnification obligations related to businesses that we have divested; certain lease obligations, which require us to guarantee the minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the lease; and selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations. 35 Table of Contents Future Capital Requirements During 2007, we intend to invest a total of approximately $250 million in capital expenditures primarily for our existing manufacturing facilities and distribution capabilities. We intend to fund these expenditures using cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility. We intend to spend this amount approximately as follows: Operating Division Amount (In millions) Dairy Group $ 165 WhiteWave Foods Company 80 Corporate 5 Total $ 250 We expect that cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our requirements for our existing businesses for the foreseeable future. As of February 23, 2007, approximately $1.20 billion was available for future borrowings under our senior credit facility. Known Trends and Uncertainties Prices of Raw Materials and Other Inputs Dairy Group The primary raw material used in our Dairy Group is raw milk (which contains both raw skim milk and butterfat). The federal government and certain state governments set minimum prices for raw milk, and those prices change on a monthly basis. The regulated minimum prices differ based on how the raw milk is utilized. Raw milk processed into fluid milk is priced at the Class I price, and raw milk processed into products such as cottage cheese, creams and creamers, ice cream and sour cream is priced at the Class II price. Generally, we pay the federal minimum prices for raw milk, plus certain producer premiums (or over order premiums) and location differentials. We also incur other raw milk procurement costs in some locations (such as hauling, field personnel, etc.). A change in the federal minimum price does not necessarily mean an identical change in our total raw milk costs, as over order premiums may increase or decrease. This relationship is different in every region of the country, and sometimes within a region based on supplier arrangements. However, in general, the overall change in our raw milk costs can be linked to the change in federal minimum prices. Because our Class II products typically have a higher fat content than that contained in raw milk, we also purchase bulk cream for use in some of our Class II products. Bulk cream is typically purchased based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Another significant raw material used by our Dairy Group is resin, which is used to make plastic bottles. We purchase approximately 27 million pounds of resin and bottles per month. Resin is a petroleum based product and the price of resin is subject to fluctuations based on changes in crude oil prices. Our Dairy Group purchases approximately four million gallons of diesel fuel per month to operate our extensive direct store delivery system. In general, our Dairy Group changes the prices that it charges for Class I dairy products on a monthly basis, as the costs of raw milk, packaging, fuel and other materials fluctuate. Prices for some Class II products are also changed monthly while others are changed from time to time as circumstances warrant. However, there can be a lag between the time of a raw material cost increase or decrease and the effectiveness of a corresponding price change to our customers, especially in the case of Class II butterfat because Class II butterfat prices for each month are not announced by the government until after the end of that month. Also, in some cases we are competitively or contractually constrained with the means and timing of implementing price changes. These factors can cause volatility in our earnings. Our sales and operating profit margin fluctuate with the price of our raw materials and other inputs. In 2005, prices for raw skim milk, butterfat and cream remained high. In 2006, prices for raw skim milk, butterfat and cream declined. We expect raw milk, butterfat and cream prices to increase in 2007. However, raw milk, butterfat and cream prices are difficult to predict and we change our forecasts frequently based on current market activity. 36 Table of Contents During the first nine months of 2006, the prices of resin and fuel increased before decreasing over the last three months of the year. As resin supplies have from time to time been insufficient to meet demand, we are undertaking all reasonable measures to attempt to secure an adequate resin supply; however, there can be no assurance that we will always be successful in our attempts. We expect prices of both resin and diesel fuel to fluctuate throughout 2007. WhiteWave Foods Company A significant raw material used to manufacture products sold by WhiteWave Foods Company is organic soybeans. We have entered into supply agreements for organic soybeans, which we believe will meet our needs for 2007. These agreements provide for pricing at fixed levels. However, should our need for organic soybeans exceed the quantity that we have under contract, or if the suppliers do not perform under the contracts, we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient supply, and the price we could be required to pay could be significantly higher. Significant raw materials used in our products include organic raw milk and sugar. We obtain our supply of organic raw milk by entering into one to two year agreements with farmers pursuant to which the farmers agree to sell us specified quantities of organic raw milk for fixed prices for the duration of the agreement. We also source approximately 20% of our organic raw milk supply from our own farms. In the recent past, the industry wide demand for organic raw milk has generally exceeded supply, resulting in our inability to fully meet customer demand. However, we expect that our efforts to foster increased supply and overall industry supply growth will ease the historical shortfall in supply over the near term. We are currently taking steps to increase consumer demand for our products to avoid a meaningful oversupply of raw organic milk; however, there can be no assurance that the supply of raw organic milk in the market will not exceed demand in an amount that could exert downward pricing pressure on the sale of our products and negatively impact our profitability. We also experienced an increase in organic sugar costs in 2006. We have entered into supply agreements for organic sugar, which we believe will meet our needs in 2007. Competitive Environment There has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery industry in recent years, and this trend is continuing. As our customer base consolidates, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers or gain new customers. There are several large regional grocery chains that have captive dairy operations. As the consolidation of the grocery industry continues, we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold to a chain with captive dairy operations. Many of our retail customers have become increasingly price sensitive in the current intensely competitive environment. Over the past few years, we have been subject to a number of competitive bidding situations in our Dairy Group segment, which reduced our profitability on sales to several customers. We expect this trend to continue. In bidding situations we are subject to the risk of losing certain customers altogether. The loss of any of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. We do not have contracts with many of our largest customers, and most of the contracts that we do have are generally terminable at will by the customer. Both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail level have caused competition to become increasingly intense at the processor level. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Tax Rate In 2006, our tax rate on continuing operations was 38.5%. We estimate the effective tax rate for 2007 will be approximately 39%. Changes in the relative profitability of our operating segments, as well as changes to federal and state tax laws may cause the rate to change from historical rates. 37 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and results, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. In many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment. In certain circumstances, however, the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. We have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies. Accounts Receivable We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses. As these factors change, our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $17.1 million, or approximately 2.1% of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006. The allowance for doubtful accounts, expressed as a percent of accounts receivable, was approximately 2.6% at December 31, 2005. Each 0.10% change in the ratio of allowance for doubtful accounts to accounts receivable would impact bad debt expense by approximately $816,000. Employee Benefit Plan Costs We provide a range of benefits including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles, which include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods. Different assumptions could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Substantially all of our qualified pension plans are consolidated into one master trust. We retained investment consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to help our Investment Committee formulate a long term investment policy for the master trust. Our current asset mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at 65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. At December 31, 2006, our master trust was invested as follows: equity securities and limited partnerships 71%; fixed income securities 26%; and cash and cash equivalents 3%. We determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plans investments based on target allocations of the pension plans investments. Additionally, we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plans investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other investments. The resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 8.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2005. While a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature, including assumed investment rates of return, compensation increases, employee turnover rates and mortality rates, generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption reflect current market conditions. As such, our discount rate likely will change more frequently than in prior years. The discount rate utilized to determine our estimated future benefit obligations increased from 5.75% at December 31, 2005 to 5.85% at December 31, 2006. A 0.25% reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by approximately $585,000 and $363,000, respectively. In addition, a 1% increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual post retirement medical expense by approximately $419,000. 38 Table of Contents Goodwill and Intangible Assets Our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $3.51 billion as of December 31, 2006 resulting primarily from acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademarks and customer related intangible assets, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. We believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from five to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment, market share, trademark history and anticipated future trademark support. Perpetual trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment at least annually to ensure that future cash flows continue to exceed the related book value. A perpetual trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds its estimated fair value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Currently, our reporting units are our two segments. If the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash flows. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital, are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. We did not recognize any impairment charges in continuing operations for goodwill during 2006. As a result of the decision to close a facility and shift customers from one regional brand to another, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $700,000 on a perpetual trademark for a regional brand during 2006. Income Taxes Deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. We estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments. There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations. If such changes take place, there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period, which could have an impact on our earnings. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee health care, workers compensation claims and other casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self insured with stop loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables including claims history and expected trends. These loss development factors are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of $172.9 million and $161.2 million, respectively, including both current and long term liabilities. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective October 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS No. 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans) to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of its postretirement benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan 39 Table of Contents assets and benefit obligations as of the date of its year end statement of financial position, and provide additional disclosures. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our financial condition at December 31, 2006 has been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 158 did not have an effect on our financial condition at December 31, 2005 or 2004. SFAS No. 158s provisions regarding the change in measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable as we already use a measurement date of December 31 for our postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 13 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our postretirement benefit plans and the effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. Among its provisions, SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we utilized the intrinsic value based method of accounting under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, and adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Under the intrinsic value based method of accounting, compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees and directors was measured as the excess of the quoted market price of common stock at the grant date over the amount the recipient must pay for the stock. Our policy is to grant stock options at fair value on the date of grant and as a result no compensation expense was historically recognized for stock options. As our restricted stock units do not require the recipients to pay for the stock, we have historically recognized compensation expense for the fair value at the date of grant over the vesting period. The fair value for the restricted stock unit grants is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date immediately prior to the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized only for share based payments expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense was recognized based on estimated forfeitures. In order to enhance comparability among all periods presented, we elected to adopt SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified retrospective approach. Under this transition method, the results for prior periods reflect the recognition of the compensation expense and related income tax benefit historically disclosed in our financial statements. For financial reporting purposes, share based compensation expense is included within the same financial statement caption where the recipients cash compensation is reported, and is classified as a corporate item for business segment reporting. See Notes 1 and 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our share based compensation plans and the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as current period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the rule in APB No. 29 which excluded from fair value measurement exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead, SFAS No. 153 excludes from fair value measurement exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes in June 2006. This interpretation clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN No. 48 on our Consolidated Financial Statements. This interpretation will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2007. 40 Table of Contents The FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements in September 2006. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not require any new fair value measurements. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2008. The FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in February 2007. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS No. 159 apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. This standard will become effective for us in the first quarter of 2008. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Fluctuations In order to reduce the volatility of earnings that arises from changes in interest rates, we manage interest rate risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements. These swap agreements provide hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated expiration dates. The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2006: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 4.81% to 4.84% December 2007 $ 500 4.07% to 4.27% December 2010 450 The following table summarizes our various interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2005: Fixed Interest Rates Expiration Date Notional Amounts (In millions) 3.65% to 6.78% December 2006 $ 625 4.81% to 4.84% December 2007 500 4.07% to 4.27% December 2010 500 We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the possibility of interest rates on our senior credit facility falling below the rates on our interest rate derivative agreements. We recorded $7.5 million of interest income, net of taxes, during 2006 as a result of interest rates on our variable rate debt rising above the agreed upon interest rate on our existing swap agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements is remote because the counter parties to our interest rate derivative agreements are major financial institutions. A majority of our debt obligations are currently at variable rates. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates. As of December 31, 2006, the analysis indicated that such interest rate movement would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from that analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movement and our actual exposure and hedges. Foreign Currency We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to operating cash flows that are denominated in foreign currencies. Our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the British pound. We have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the analysis indicated that such foreign currency exchange rate change would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 41 Table of Contents Butterfat Our Dairy Group utilizes a significant amount of butterfat to produce Class II products. This butterfat is acquired through the purchase of raw milk and bulk cream. Butterfat acquired in raw milk is priced based on the Class II butterfat price in federal orders, which is announced near the end of the applicable month. The Class II butterfat price can generally be tied to the pricing of AA butter traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The cost of butterfat acquired in bulk cream is typically based on a multiple of the AA butter price on the CME. From time to time, we purchase butter futures and butter inventory in an effort to better manage our butterfat cost in Class II products. Futures contracts are marked to market in accordance with SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and physical inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market. We are exposed to market risk under this risk management strategy if the cost of butter falls below the cost that we have agreed to pay in a futures contract or that we actually paid for the physical inventory and we are unable to pass on the difference to our customers. At this time we believe that potential losses due to butterfat hedging activities would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or operating cash flow. 42
