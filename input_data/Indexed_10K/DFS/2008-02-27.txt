Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K particularly under Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to Notes to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements are to the Notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements as of November 30, 2007 and 2006 and for the three year period ended November 30, 2007. Introduction and Overview We are a leading credit card issuer and electronic payment services company with one of the most recognized brands in U.S. financial services. We offer credit and prepaid cards and other financial products and services to qualified customers in the United States and the United Kingdom, and provide payment processing and related services to merchants and financial institutions in the United States. Our year ends on November 30 of each year. We strive to increase net income and achieve other business objectives by growing loan receivables and increasing volume on our payments networks to generate interest and fee revenue, while controlling loan losses and expenses. Our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables, securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions, and fees earned from cardmembers, merchants and issuers. Our primary expenses include funding costs (interest expense), loan losses, cardmember rewards and expenses incurred to grow and service our loan receivables (e.g., compensation expense and marketing). We are actively pursuing a strategy to increase acceptance of Discover Network cards among small and mid size merchants. We have entered into arrangements with major merchant acquirers to sign new and service existing small and mid size merchants for acceptance of Discover Network cards. We undertook a number of initiatives in an effort to restore profitability to our U.K. operations over the long term and offset the impact of higher loan losses and lower interchange and fee revenues. These initiatives included insourcing of our processing platform, consolidation of our operational centers, reductions in staffing and achieving procurement efficiencies. In addition, we revised certain risk policies, modified pricing for portions of the portfolio, implemented annual fees for certain customers, introduced new fee products and modified certain transaction based fees. On February 7, 2008, we announced that we had entered into a definitive sale and purchase agreement to sell our U.K. credit card business, which represents substantially all of the International Card segment, to Barclays Bank Plc. See Sale of International Card Segment; First Quarter 2008 Charge below for further discussion. Our business activities have been funded primarily through the process of asset securitization, the raising of consumer deposits, and, prior to the Distribution, intercompany lending from Morgan Stanley which has been replaced with asset backed financing and both secured and unsecured debt. In a credit card securitization, loan receivables are first transferred to securitization trusts, from which beneficial interests are issued to investors. We continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans. The trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries and are independent from us. These trusts are excluded from our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Because our securitization activities qualify as sales under GAAP and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions, we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investor interests in securitized loans from the 41 Table of Contents consolidated and combined statements of financial condition. As a result, asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements in that the portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. Securitization income is our second most significant revenue category. Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided sellers interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is a non GAAP presentation, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income. The managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions; however, there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed. Specifically, these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in the transactions and cardmember payments allocated to the securitized loans, both of which are held at the trusts. These assets also include the interest only strip receivable, reflecting the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests. Income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts, changes in the fair value of the interest only strip receivable and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in our securitizations. Managed loan data is also relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. Financial measures using managed data are non GAAP financial measures. Whenever managed data is presented in this annual report on Form 10 K, a reconciliation of the managed data to the most directly comparable GAAP basis financial measure is provided. See GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations. Key Developments Impacting Reported Results In August 2007, management began a strategic review of the International Card segment. This review, which was completed in the fourth quarter, involved a review of U.K. financing options and costs (particularly given market disruptions), consideration of industry trends in the United Kingdom, the various challenges facing credit card issuers in that market, the impact of certain initiatives we have already undertaken to restore profitability to the segment and the expected impact of additional actions planned in light of these circumstances. As a result of the strategic review, management revised its long range projections for the International Card segment, and revised its estimate of the segments fair value. The carrying value of the International Card segment at November 30, 2007 was in excess of its revised estimated fair value, and, as such, we recorded a non cash impairment charge of $391 million ($279 million after tax) to other expense. The total pretax impairment charge included a $291 million write down of goodwill and $100 million write down of other intangible assets. Certain of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates which are tied to short term market indices, such as the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR. During the year ended November 30, 2006, the Federal Reserve increased the Federal Funds target rate by 125 bps to 5.25%. As a result, the yields on interest earning assets and the costs of floating rate interest bearing liabilities increased during 2006 and remained at these levels for most of 2007. During this period, the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR remained stable. 42 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2007, in response to worsening credit conditions, the Federal Reserve decreased the Federal Funds target rate by 75 basis points to 4.50%. During this period, tight credit conditions caused the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR to change materially, with LIBOR often remaining significantly higher than the Federal Funds rate. Also, asset backed commercial paper rates rose and credit spreads widened materially. Market conditions also reduced the availability of new issuance in certain funding markets. In response to various liquidity events, our senior management increased the size of our liquidity reserve. In the United Kingdom, disruptions in the financial markets as well as a weakened consumer credit environment have impacted asset backed securitization issuance, leading us to retain on our balance sheet approximately $500 million of receivables from a maturing asset backed transaction as of November 30, 2007. On June 30, 2007, our Distribution from Morgan Stanley became effective. Our results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2007 include costs incurred as a result of the Distribution of approximately $34 million. New U.S. bankruptcy legislation became effective in October 2005, making it more difficult for consumers to declare bankruptcy. We experienced a surge in bankruptcy receipts leading up to the effective date of this legislation. We charge off bankrupt accounts at the end of the month that is 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy, so in the second half of calendar 2005 we experienced higher charge offs as a result of this legislation. October 2005 was the peak month for bankruptcy receipts during this transition to new legislation. October receipts, in accordance with our policy, were charged off in December 2005. The results of 2005 were adversely impacted by a higher level of bankruptcy charge offs, a negative revaluation of the interest only strip receivable reflecting the impact on projected excess spread of elevated charge offs in December 2005 and additional provisions to the allowance for loans losses for bankrupt accounts in the portfolio at November 30, 2005. We experienced a dramatic decline in bankruptcy receipts following the effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation. The results of 2006 benefited from a significantly lower level of bankruptcy charge offs, a favorable revaluation of the interest only strip receivable reflecting higher excess spread projections and a decrease in the level of allowance for loan losses. We believe the passing of this legislation negatively impacted 2005 and benefited the overall results of 2006, causing year over year comparisons to the year ended November 30, 2007 to be impacted as well. During 2007, the Company experienced a higher level of bankruptcy charge offs, although still significantly lower than pre legislation levels. Separate from the previously described impact of the surge in bankruptcy receipts, the underlying credit quality of the U.S. loan receivables continued to improve in 2006 and 2005 and remained relatively stable throughout most of 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007, delinquencies began to rise reflecting the downturn in market conditions. During 2006 and 2005, certain matters caused our use of certain funding sources, including the U.S. credit card securitization market, to vary from our historical use of this market for funding our business. Following Morgan Stanleys announcement in April 2005 to explore a spin off of Discover, the counter party credit ratings on Discover Bank were lowered to their current levels. As a result of our lower credit ratings, we lost access to Federal Funds as a significant source of short term financing, but were able to mitigate the impact by increasing short term borrowings from Morgan Stanley. In response to the exploration of the spin off, Moodys placed the asset backed securities issued domestically by the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT) under review for a possible downgrade, which we believe contributed to a temporary disruption in our ability to access the securitization markets. This disruption lasted approximately five months, at which time Moodys re affirmed the ratings on the asset backed securities. This deferral of new securitization transactions, as well as a high 43 Table of Contents level of maturities of existing securitization transactions and the discontinued issuance of new short term certificates from the DCMT in response to higher projected charge offs following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation, caused the level of securitized loans in 2005 to decrease below prior year levels. These effects lingered into 2006, causing outstanding securitization transactions to remain somewhat lower than historical levels on average. In August 2005, Morgan Stanley announced that it would not pursue a spin off of Discover. During the last three years, there have been increasing regulatory initiatives in the United Kingdom with respect to late and overlimit fees, interchange fees and the sale of retail insurance products, and a relaxation of bankruptcy laws that have made it more difficult to collect on delinquent accounts and easier for cardmembers to declare bankruptcy. The changes contributed to increased U.K. bankruptcy charge offs and lower late fee, overlimit fee and interchange revenues. In February 2006, we acquired the Goldfish credit card business in the United Kingdom, adding approximately $1.4 billion in receivables. Under the terms of the acquisition, we did not purchase any late stage delinquencies. As such, the year ended November 30, 2006 reflects a lower level of charge offs than the year ended November 30, 2007, which includes the full impact of the Goldfish acquisition. Sale of International Card Segment; First Quarter 2008 Charge On February 7, 2008 the Company and Barclays Bank Plc entered into a definitive sale and purchase agreement relating to the sale of &pound;129 million of net assets (equivalent to approximately $258 million) of the Companys U.K. credit card business, which represented substantially all of the Companys International Card segment and included $3.1 billion in owned loan receivables at November 30, 2007. The aggregate sale price under the agreement is &pound;35 million (equivalent to approximately $70 million), payable in cash at closing and subject to a post closing adjustment. The closing is expected to occur by the end of the Companys second quarter of 2008. As a result, the International Card segment will be presented as discontinued operations beginning with first quarter 2008 reporting. The sale is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including clearance from the U.K. Office of Fair Trading, a minimum value of receivables to be transferred and consents under material contracts. There can be no assurance that the sale will occur by the end of the second quarter of 2008, if at all. Based on the terms of the sale, the Company expects to record charges of approximately $240 to $270 million pre tax ($190 to $210 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2008 associated with classifying the segment as held for sale, substantially all of which will be non cash. These charges, the majority of which are expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2008, include approximately $5 million related to the termination of certain contractual arrangements and approximately $7 million of employee related costs. This will be partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of other assets related to the U.K. business of approximately $45 million. Segments We manage our business activities in three segments: U.S. Card, Third Party Payments and International Card. In compiling the segment results that follow, the U.S. Card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Third Party Payments segment. U.S. Card. The U.S. Card segment offers Discover Card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses over the Discover Network. Also included within the U.S. Card segment are our other consumer products and services businesses, including prepaid and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our subsidiary, Discover Bank. Third Party Payments. The Third Party Payments segment includes PULSE and our third party payments business. International Card. The International Card segment offers consumer finance products and services in the United Kingdom, including Morgan Stanley branded, Goldfish branded and various affinity branded credit cards issued on the MasterCard and Visa networks. 44 Table of Contents The following table presents segment data on a managed basis (dollars in thousands), and a reconciliation to a GAAP presentation.

Securitization income is reported in other income. (2) 2007 includes a $391 million pretax ($279 million after tax) non cash impairment charge related to our International Card segment. (3) PULSE was acquired in January 2005. The segment discussions that follow for the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are on a managed basis. U.S. Card The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $1.5 billion for the year ended November 30, 2007, down 8% as compared to November 30, 2006. The decrease in pretax income was driven by an increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net interest income. Provision for loan losses increased $189.9 million, or 11%, reflecting an increase in bankruptcy charge offs compared to the unusually low levels in 2006 and a higher level of loans retained on our balance sheet. Net interest income increased $59.1 million, or 2%, due to higher interest income, reflecting higher average receivables, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, reflecting increased funding costs and borrowings. 45 Table of Contents For the year ended November 30, 2007, managed loans grew 5%, to $48.2 billion, driven by record sales volume of $90.3 billion, up 4% over last year. U.S. credit quality remained strong, although delinquency rates increased from last year reflecting weakening in the U.S. economy. The managed net charge off rate of 3.84% was down 12 basis points from last year and the over 30 day delinquency rate of 3.59% was 20 basis points higher than last year. In 2008 we estimate the full year managed net charge off rate will be between 4.75% and 5.00%. A small portion of our newly originated loans are issued to borrowers with FICO scores below 660 at the time of account origination but who have met our other specific underwriting criteria indicating to us that they have the ability and willingness to pay. We have restricted this initiative to potential customers with FICO scores above 600, and the majority of these new accounts had FICO scores at origination in the 640 to 660 range. At November 30, 2007, less than 3.5% of receivables related to new accounts originated within the year were at FICO scores below 660 at time of origination. While we seek to carefully control the level of new account originations at FICO scores below 660, over time some accounts that were originated at higher FICO scores will migrate to levels below 660 due to circumstances that affect their credit performance. Consistent with industry standards for reporting securitization U.S. master trust data, we disclosed that as of October 31, 2007, approximately 26% of receivable balances in the domestic trust related to accounts with FICO scores below 660 at that date. While this percentage relates solely to credit card receivables held in the trust, we believe they are representative of our managed loan portfolio. The U.S. Card segment produced strong results for the year ended November 30, 2006, with pretax income of $1.6 billion, up 72%, as compared to November 30, 2005. These results reflected the strong credit quality of the domestic managed credit card portfolio and the continued favorable impact of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation on charge offs, the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and the allowance for loan losses. The increase in pretax income was due to higher other income and a lower provision for loan losses partially offset by lower net interest income and higher other expenses. Other income increased $343.8 million, or 20%, due primarily to an increase in the fair value of our interest only strip receivable as a result of lower bankruptcy receipts and our estimate of its related favorable impact on future charge offs as well as a higher level of new securitization transactions. Provision for loan losses decreased $600.1 million, or 27%, reflecting strong credit quality and lower bankruptcy charge offs. Net interest income decreased $149.9 million, or 4%, as higher interest expense was partially offset by higher interest income. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds driven by the rising interest rate environment. The increase in interest income reflects lower interest charge offs due to improved credit quality and the effect of a rising interest rate environment on floating rate credit card loan receivables partially offset by higher promotional rate balances. Other expense increased $109.8 million, or 5%, driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and increased legal fees, primarily related to the litigation against Visa and MasterCard, and consulting costs, partially offset by lower cardmember fraud expense. For the year ended November 30, 2006, managed credit card loans grew 3%, to $45.7 billion, driven by higher transaction volume partially offset by higher cardmember payment rates. Sales volume increased 6%, primarily reflecting increased cardmember usage and higher prices of gasoline (which represents approximately 8% of sales volume). Managed interest spread compressed 50 basis points as increased cost of funds outpaced higher interest yield. The managed net charge off rate of 3.96% decreased 134 basis points, reflecting strong credit quality and lower bankruptcy charge offs. Over 30 and over 90 day delinquency rates decreased 59 basis points and 16 basis points to 3.39% and 1.59%, respectively, due to a shift to loans with lower risk profiles and improved collection experience. Third Party Payments The Third Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $37.0 million for the year ended November 30, 2007, up 28% as compared to November 30, 2006. The increase in pretax income was driven by higher revenue from increased volumes that was partially offset by higher marketing and pricing incentives and 46 Table of Contents from higher third party card issuer fees. Third Party Payments debit and credit volume was $91.7 billion for the year ended November 30, 2007, up 25% from 2006. The Third Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $28.9 million for the year ended November 30, 2006 versus a pretax loss of $0.1 million for the year ended November 30, 2005 driven by increased other income and lower other expense. Other income increased $18.5 million, or 20%, due to higher volume from third party card issuers signed in mid 2005 and higher transaction processing revenue related to increased volume on the PULSE Network. Other expense decreased $9.3 million, or 10%, as a result of one time costs incurred in 2005 in connection with third party issuer signings partially offset by higher transaction processing expense related to increased volumes on the PULSE Network. Transactions processed on the PULSE Network increased 300 million, or 19%, to 1.9 billion for the year ended November 30, 2006. International Card The International Card segment reported a pretax loss of $596.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to a pretax loss of $87.1 million for the year ended November 30, 2006, driven by a non cash impairment charge of $391 million as well as higher provision for loan losses and other expenses. Continued disruption in the U.K. financial markets, higher interest rates and our decision to reduce our loan exposure to the U.K. market have negatively affected the book value of the Goldfish business, resulting in the impairment charge. The provision for loan losses increased $79.3 million, or 33%, reflecting a full period of charge offs related to the Goldfish and Liverpool Victoria portfolios, weakening in the consumer credit environment in the United Kingdom, maturing securitizations resulting in an increase in receivables being retained in the portfolio, and an increase in the provision for loan losses related to the implementation of higher minimum payment requirements on certain accounts. Other expenses, excluding the impairment charge, increased $36.9 million, or 15%, primarily due to spin off related costs and various business initiatives. The International Card managed credit card receivables decreased 6% from last year to $4.4 billion, reflecting increased payments and lower loan growth as we shifted our focus to reducing unprofitable accounts. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates. The managed net charge off rate of 6.54% increased 109 basis points from last year. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate increased 67 basis points from last year to 5.25%. The International Card segment reported a pretax loss of $87.1 million for the year ended November 30, 2006, an increase of $55.4 million over the pretax loss incurred for the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Goldfish business and the deteriorating consumer credit environment in the United Kingdom. The increase in pretax loss was driven by increases in the provision for loan losses and other expense partially offset by higher net interest income and other income. The provision for loan losses increased $111.7 million, or 88%, as a result of the weakened credit environment in the United Kingdom, the Goldfish acquisition and increased bankruptcy charge offs. Other expense increased $86.4 million, or 52%, primarily due to incremental costs as a result of the acquisition of the Goldfish business. Net interest income increased $75.3 million, or 46%, and other income increased $67.5 million, or 69%, primarily related to a higher level of managed loan receivables as a result of the acquisition of the Goldfish business. The increase in other income was partially offset by lower levels of late and overlimit fee revenues resulting from regulatory changes which limited the per incident amount of fees that can be charged. For the year ended November 30, 2006, managed credit card loans grew $2.0 billion, or 74%, to $4.6 billion primarily due to the addition of the Goldfish business. Managed interest spread was flat compared to the prior year as lower yield was offset by lower cost of funds. Credit quality continued to deteriorate as the managed net charge off rate rose 135 basis points to 5.45%, and the over 30 and over 90 day delinquency rates increased to 4.58% and 2.22%, respectively. 47 Table of Contents GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our statements of financial condition. Instances in which we retain certificated beneficial interests in the securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in investment securities available for sale. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitization. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts, occurring as a result of the degree to which receivables from newer accounts are added to the trusts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers and lower charge offs and delinquencies. Beginning with Earnings Summary, the discussion of GAAP results is presented on a consolidated and combined basis with any material differences between segment performance specifically identified.

For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated and combined financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition. Management has identified the policies related to the estimation of the allowance for loan losses, the accounting for asset securitization transactions, interest income recognition, the accrual of cardmember rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and accrual of income taxes as critical accounting policies. 50 Table of Contents Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable net loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management evaluates the allowance quarterly for adequacy. The allowance is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses. In estimating losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio, we use an approach that utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in loan receivables. In determining the proper level of the allowance for loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy receipts, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. If management used different assumptions in estimating probable losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in managements estimate of probable net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $92 million in the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2007, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. See Note 5: Loan Receivables to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about the allowance for loan losses. Accounting for Asset Securitization Transactions We account for our securitization transactions in accordance with Statement No. 140. The gain on the securitization transaction depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of the transfer. The interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive interest and certain loan fee revenues less certain costs, including loan losses on securitized loans and the contractual rate of interest paid to third party investors in the securitization as well as a servicing fee from the trust over the life of the asset sold. In the absence of observable market prices, the fair value of the interest only strip receivable is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using managements best estimate of the key assumptions, including forecasted interest yield, loan losses and payment rates, the interest paid to investors and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. Changes in the estimated fair value of the interest only strip receivable, as well as certain other retained interests, are recorded in securitization income. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results. In addition, estimates are likely to change in the future as components of the interest only strip receivable valuation are sensitive to market and economic conditions. If management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip receivable, the impact could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 20% change in the excess spread assumption for all securitized loans could have resulted in a change of approximately $80 million in the value of the interest only strip receivable as of November 30, 2007. See Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information about the accounting for securitizations. Interest Income Recognition Interest income earned through finance charges on credit card loans is calculated based on the amount of loans outstanding and the contractual interest rates on such loans. Accrued interest is included in credit card loan receivables when billed to the cardmember. We accrue unbilled interest revenue on a monthly basis from a cardmembers billing cycle date to the end of the month. The unbilled interest accrual is recorded on the consolidated and combined statements of financial condition in accrued interest receivable for owned loans and in amounts due from asset securitization for securitized loans. We make certain assumptions and estimates in the 51 Table of Contents determination of unbilled accrued interest, including a projection of the percentage of loan balances that will revolve. We apply the same methodology in the determination of unbilled accrued interest for both owned loans and securitized loans. If management used different assumptions in the determination of the unbilled portion of accrued interest income and the valuation of accrued interest on securitized loans, our financial condition and results of operations could have been materially different. For example, a 10% change in managements projection of the percentage of loans that will revolve in the next cycle could have resulted in a combined change in accrued interest receivable and amounts due from asset securitization of approximately $31 million at November 30, 2007, with a corresponding change in interest income. See Net Interest Income for additional details concerning interest earned through finance charges on credit card loans. Cardmember Rewards Cost We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we offer certain cardmembers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmembers purchases. The liability for cardmember rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated and combined statements of financial condition. We compute rewards liability on an individual cardmember basis and it is accumulated as qualified cardmembers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity. The liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. We estimate forfeitures based on historical account closure and charge off experience and actual cardmember purchase activity. We recognize Cashback Bonus reward cost for both owned loans and securitized loans as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated and combined statements of income. If management used a different estimate of forfeitures, our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations could have differed significantly. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of November 30, 2007, could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $9 million. The corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue. See Other Income and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about cardmember rewards cost. Goodwill We recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair values of the acquired net assets. As required by GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the business unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. Because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses. In applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. We may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. The valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. If the assumptions used by management in valuing its acquired businesses are inappropriate, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when realized, could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. Following a strategic review of the International Card segment that began in the third quarter of 2007 and was completed in the fourth quarter, management determined that an interim test for impairment was needed on 52 Table of Contents the goodwill associated with that segment. The impairment test resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge impacting goodwill and other intangible assets. See Note 9: Goodwill to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further details concerning the fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the United States, its states and municipalities, and the United Kingdom. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. Changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. When such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations can be significant. See Note 17: Income Taxes to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information about income taxes. Earnings Summary The following table outlines changes in our consolidated and combined statement of income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2007 vs. 2006increase (decrease) 2006 vs. 2005increase (decrease) 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % Interest income $ 2,888,169 $ 2,458,526 $ 2,174,811 $ 429,643 17 % $ 283,715 13 % Interest expense 1,382,415 940,040 776,479 442,375 47 % 163,561 21 % Net interest income 1,505,754 1,518,486 1,398,332 (12,732 ) (1 %) 120,154 9 % Provision for loan losses 950,165 755,637 878,486 194,528 26 % (122,849 ) (14 %) Net interest income after provision for loan losses 555,589 762,849 519,846 (207,260 ) (27 %) 243,003 47 % Other income 3,546,119 3,538,939 2,937,037 7,180 0 % 601,902 20 % Other expense 3,156,512 2,719,483 2,532,627 437,029 16 % 186,856 7 % Pretax income 945,196 1,582,305 924,256 (637,109 ) (40 %) 658,049 71 % Income tax expense 356,566 505,689 346,341 (149,123 ) (29 %) 159,348 46 % Net income $ 588,630 $ 1,076,616 $ 577,915 $ (487,986 ) (45 %) $ 498,701 86 % Net income for the year ended November 30, 2007 was $588.6 million, down 45% compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, driven by a non cash impairment charge of $391 million, as well as higher provision for loan losses and other expense. The U.S. provision for loan losses increased, reflecting a trend toward higher levels of delinquencies as well as a higher level of loans retained on the companys balance sheet. The international provision for loan losses increased due to a full period of charge offs related to the Goldfish and Liverpool Victoria portfolios, weakening in the consumer credit environment in the United Kingdom, certain maturing securitized receivables being retained in the portfolio, and an increase in reserves related to the implementation of higher minimum payment requirements on certain accounts. Other expense excluding the impairment charge, increased due to spin off related costs and various business initiatives. The year ended November 30, 2007 also included a higher effective tax rate. Net income for 2006 and 2005 was influenced by consumer behavior in anticipation of the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation. We believe 2005 results were adversely affected as 53 Table of Contents consumers filed for bankruptcy before the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation. This legislation resulted in an acceleration of charge offs in 2005 and first quarter 2006, a negative revaluation of the interest only strip receivable in 2005 and additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in 2005. In contrast, full year 2006 results were positively affected by a sharp decline in consumer bankruptcy receipts, resulting in lower charge offs. Full year 2006 also benefited from a favorable revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and a decrease in the level of allowance for loan losses. Net income for the year ended November 30, 2006 was a record $1.1 billion, up 86% compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, driven by higher other income and net interest income and lower provision for loan losses, as well as a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher other expenses. Other income increased due to higher securitization income resulting from lower credit losses on securitized loans attributable to strong credit quality and the continued lower level of charge offs following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation, resulting in a higher excess spread and a favorable revaluation of the interest only strip receivable. Increases in other expenses were driven by costs related to the Goldfish acquisition, higher compensation and benefit costs and increased legal and consulting costs. Also, the year ended November 30, 2006 included a lower effective tax rate due to tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of various tax matters. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. Net interest margin states the interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest earning assets. Our interest earning assets consist of loan receivables, certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization, certain cash and cash equivalents, including Federal Funds sold, and investment securities. Because the third party investor interests in securitization transactions are not assets owned by us, they are not included in interest earning assets nor is the interest yield on the related loans included in interest income. See Note 4: Investment Securities for further disclosure regarding investment securities. Net interest income for the year ended November 30, 2007 decreased $12.7 million, or 1%, and net interest margin decreased 118 basis points to 4.76% as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The modest decrease in net interest income was due to higher average interest bearing liabilities and a higher cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities largely offset by higher average interest earning assets. In 2007, the establishment of the liquidity reserve, which earns a lower interest rate, adversely impacted the net interest margin for the year ended November 30, 2007. Net interest income for the year ended November 30, 2006 increased $120.2 million, or 9%, and net interest margin increased 6 basis points to 5.94% as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005. The increase in net interest income is due to higher average interest earning assets and a higher interest yield offset by an increase in the cost of funds. The favorable impact of the higher interest yield on net interest margin was offset in part by the higher average interest earning assets and the higher cost of funds. Interest income is influenced by the level of interest earning assets, the most significant of which is our loan receivables. The level of loan receivables can be influenced by portfolio growth strategies, including portfolio acquisition, cardmember spending and payment behavior and changes in the level of securitized loans. Typically, new securitization transactions have the effect of decreasing loan receivables, whereas maturities of existing securitization transactions increase loan receivables. For the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, there were higher levels of average securitized loans than their respective prior year comparisons. However, these higher levels were more than offset by overall growth in average loans, resulting in higher average loan receivables, contributing favorably to interest income in 2007 and 2006. Other interest earning assets that can influence interest income are certain amounts due from asset securitization included in other interest earning assets on the average balance sheet, certain cash and cash equivalents, including Federal Funds sold, and investment securities. Amounts due from asset securitization 54 Table of Contents relate to certain assets retained by us in securitization transactions. The levels of these assets are impacted by securitization maturities and can vary in relation to the level of securitized loans. Federal Funds sold represent amounts maintained for liquidity purposes. For the year ended November 30, 2007, the interest income was favorably impacted by a higher level of Federal Funds sold, which was significantly greater in comparison to that of prior years as a result of the establishment of our liquidity reserve in the first half of 2007. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion of our liquidity reserve. Interest income is also influenced by the interest rate on interest earning assets. Credit card loan receivables earn interest at fixed rates as well as floating rates that are aligned with the prime rate. Amounts due from asset securitization and Federal Funds sold earn interest at floating rates tied to short term rates aligned with market indices. Accordingly, interest income earned on floating rate interest earning assets is influenced by changes in the interest rate environment. Loan receivables are our largest asset. During the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, average credit card loan receivables earning interest at floating rates represented 45%, 52% and 50%, respectively, of total average loan receivables. The prime rate decreased 0.75% during the fourth quarter of 2007. The impact of this decline on interest income in 2007 was lessened due to the timing of the decrease in the prime rate and a shift to a higher percentage of fixed rate average loan receivables. Conversely, during 2006 and 2005, the prime rate increased 1.25% and 2.00%, respectively, which contributed favorably to interest income earned on the owned loan receivables, amounts due from asset securitizations and Federal Funds sold. Additionally, interest income in 2006 was further impacted by a higher percentage of loan receivables earning interest at floating rates. Credit performance is another factor which influences interest income. As a result of the improved credit environment following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation and our risk management practices, the number of cardmembers having lower risk profiles has increased. Generally, cardmembers with a lower risk profile have higher payment rates, resulting in a lower percentage of loan receivables on which interest is accrued. Although interest income is lower as a result, interest related charge offs, which are recorded as a reduction to interest income, are also lower. This was particularly evident following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation. The differences in year over year comparisons have narrowed as charge offs have increased from the levels seen at the initial time period following the legislations effective date. The interest billed and subsequently charged off, net of recoveries, was 0.90% for both years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006 and 1.14% for the year ended November 30, 2005. Interest bearing liabilities reflect our funding requirements and consist of deposits and short and long term borrowings. Prior to the Distribution, interest bearing liabilities also included borrowings from Morgan Stanley. We incur interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities at fixed and floating rates. Accordingly, changes in the interest rate environment, changes in the percentage of floating rate interest bearing liabilities and the replacement of maturing debt can impact interest expense. The floating rate average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of total average interest bearing liabilities was approximately 48% during both years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006 and 41% during the year ended November 30, 2005. The level of average interest bearing liabilities during 2007 was higher than prior year, reflecting the establishment of a liquidity reserve and growth in loan receivables. Accordingly, the level of floating rate average interest bearing liabilities, specifically money market accounts, was higher as well. The increased levels of floating rate interest bearing liabilities coupled with the higher interest rate environment in 2007 as compared to 2006, adversely impacted interest expense. In addition, the higher interest rate environment in 2007 also had a negative effect on the cost of issuing new fixed rate certificates of deposit to replace maturing certificates of deposit issued at lower, historical rates. Similarly, the increase in the percentage of floating rate average interest bearing liabilities during the year ended November 30, 2006, as compared to 2005, adversely impacted interest expense due to a rising interest rate environment. Interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate swaps we enter into as part of our interest rate risk management program. The program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of loan receivables as well as our right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed or floating rate loan receivables to a new interest rate in the future. 55 Table of Contents The following tables provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes for the years ended November 30 (dollars in thousands): Average Balance Sheet Analysis 2007 2006 2005 AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest Assets Interest earning assets: Interest earning deposits in other banks $ 464,643 5.41 % $ 25,114 $ 1,101 3.78 % $ 42 $ 861 3.48 % $ 30 Federal Funds sold 4,737,859 5.10 % 241,727 339,016 4.74 % 16,055 562,278 3.16 % 17,771 Commercial paper 15,434 5.26 % 812 13,850 5.01 % 693 13,955 3.07 % 428 Investment securities 199,075 5.28 % 10,502 55,476 5.46 % 3,028 14,350 4.74 % 680 Loans:(1) Domestic Credit cards 19,845,880 10.75 % 2,134,188 19,120,946 10.50 % 2,007,737 18,644,660 10.16 % 1,893,681 Other consumer loans 101,904 6.32 % 6,442 131,982 7.20 % 9,501 231,093 7.51 % 17,357 Total domestic 19,947,784 10.73 % 2,140,630 19,252,928 10.48 % 2,017,238 18,875,753 10.12 % 1,911,038 International Credit cards 2,968,163 9.42 % 279,700 2,535,349 9.51 % 241,205 1,286,976 9.63 % 123,940 Other consumer loans 53,019 7.62 % 4,040 135,494 7.72 % 10,459 Total international 2,968,163 9.42 % 279,700 2,588,368 9.47 % 245,245 1,422,470 9.45 % 134,399 Total loans 22,915,947 10.56 % 2,420,330 21,841,296 10.36 % 2,262,483 20,298,223 10.08 % 2,045,437 Other interest earning assets 3,318,661 5.72 % 189,684 3,295,406 5.35 % 176,225 2,894,064 3.82 % 110,465 Total interest earning assets 31,651,619 9.12 % 2,888,169 25,546,145 9.62 % 2,458,526 23,783,731 9.14 % 2,174,811 Allowance for loan losses (802,066 ) (791,088 ) (864,224 ) Other assets 3,082,026 2,629,713 2,319,973 Total assets $ 33,931,579 $ 27,384,770 $ 25,239,480 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits: Time deposits(2) $ 16,423,343 5.19 % 851,987 $ 12,585,124 4.67 % 587,243 $ 13,829,102 4.28 % 591,338 Money market deposits 3,662,961 5.22 % 191,389 1,683,975 4.88 % 82,239 685,201 2.90 % 19,885 Other interest bearing deposits 36,748 3.26 % 1,198 25,613 3.29 % 844 6,038 1.01 % 60 Total interest bearing deposits 20,123,052 5.19 % 1,044,574 14,294,712 4.69 % 670,326 14,520,341 4.21 % 611,283 Borrowings: Short term borrowings Domestic 1,629,810 5.48 % 89,312 2,334,648 5.03 % 117,462 2,040,719 3.07 % 62,686 International 2,341,140 6.10 % 142,885 1,805,302 4.22 % 76,258 998,431 4.49 % 44,799 Total short term borrowings 3,970,950 5.85 % 232,197 4,139,950 4.68 % 193,720 3,039,150 3.54 % 107,485 Long term borrowings Domestic 1,459,114 6.13 % 89,377 820,045 5.91 % 48,492 817,224 5.41 % 44,243 International 343,947 4.73 % 16,267 576,276 4.77 % 27,502 279,574 4.82 % 13,468 Total long term borrowings 1,803,061 5.86 % 105,644 1,396,321 5.44 % 75,994 1,096,798 5.26 % 57,711 Total borrowings 5,774,011 5.85 % 337,841 5,536,271 4.87 % 269,714 4,135,948 3.99 % 165,196 Total interest bearing liabilities 25,897,063 5.34 % 1,382,415 19,830,983 4.74 % 940,040 18,656,289 4.16 % 776,479 Other liabilities and stockholders equity 8,034,516 7,553,787 6,583,191 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 33,931,579 $ 27,384,770 $ 25,239,480 Net interest income $ 1,505,754 $ 1,518,486 $ 1,398,332 Net interest margin(3) 4.76 % 5.94 % 5.88 % Interest rate spread(4) 3.78 % 4.88 % 4.98 % (1) Average balances of loan receivables include non accruing loans and these loans are therefore included in the yield calculations.

For the year ended November 30, 2007, interest income increased $429.6 million, or 17%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due to higher average interest earning assets of $6.1 billion offset by a 50 basis point decrease in interest yield. The level of interest earning assets reflects higher Federal Funds sold associated with the establishment of a liquidity reserve, growth in credit card loan receivables and the inclusion of Goldfish loan receivables for a full twelve months. The interest yield for the year ended November 30, 2007, was adversely impacted by a higher mix of lower yielding Federal Funds sold associated with the establishment of the liquidity reserve. This was offset in part by the favorable impact of a higher comparative interest rate environment on floating rate assets, including domestic credit card loan receivables, amounts due from asset securitization and Federal Funds sold. 57 Table of Contents For the year ended November 30, 2007, interest expense increased $442.4 million, or 47%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due to a $6.1 billion increase in the level of average interest bearing liabilities to support the increase in interest earning assets and a 60 basis point increase in the average cost of funds. The higher cost of funds reflects the impact of the higher comparative interest rate environment on floating rate money market deposits and short term borrowings, the replacement of maturing certificates of deposit with issuances having higher interest rates and the higher cost of funding following the Distribution. For the year ended November 30, 2006, interest income increased $283.7 million, or 13%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, due to higher average interest earning assets of $1.8 billion and a 48 basis point increase in interest yield. The level of interest earning assets reflects higher credit card loan receivables resulting from the acquisition of Goldfish and higher domestic sales volume, in addition to higher amounts due from asset securitization. The increase in the interest yield is largely attributable to improved credit quality on the domestic credit card loan receivables following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation and the related lower level of interest charge offs. The higher interest yield also reflects higher interest income on floating rate interest earning assets resulting from the rising interest rate environment. For the year ended November 30, 2006, interest expense increased $163.6 million, or 21%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, due to a 58 basis point increase in the average cost of funds and a $1.2 billion increase in the level of average interest bearing liabilities to support the increase in interest earning assets. The increase in the average cost of funds reflects the effect of the rising interest rate environment on interest bearing liabilities that are tied to floating rates. This effect was partially offset by the replacement of maturing brokered certificates of deposit with shorter term instruments having lower costs. The increase in average interest bearing liabilities consists of higher short term notes payable to Morgan Stanley due to a lower level of U.K. securitized loans, higher money market accounts obtained from the Bank Deposit Program and higher Federal Funds purchased, specifically from Morgan Stanley Bank. Maturities and Sensitivities of Loan Receivables to Changes in Interest Rates Our loan receivables had the following maturity distribution(1) at November 30, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Due OneYear or Less Due AfterOne YearThroughFive Years Due AfterFive Years Total Domestic: Credit card $ 4,961,352 $ 10,333,950 $ 5,050,485 $ 20,345,787 Commercial loans 72,686 124,948 36,502 234,136 Other consumer loans 2,574 80,034 168,586 251,194 International 672,368 1,521,498 929,312 3,123,178 Loan receivables $ 5,708,980 $ 12,060,430 $ 6,184,885 $ 23,954,295 (1) Because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, which historically have been higher than contractually required minimum payments, this amount may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments. At November 30, 2007, of our loan receivables due after one year, approximately $6.8 billion had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $11.4 billion were fixed rate loans. Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that 58 Table of Contents influence the provision for loan losses include the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance, the seasoning of our loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. We consider the credit quality of the loan portfolio in determining the allowance for loan losses. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Credit quality at any time reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts, the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, and the seasoning of the loans. For the year ended November 30, 2007, the provision for loan losses increased $194.5 million, or 26%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, reflecting a higher level of loan receivables and an increase in domestic delinquencies in the fourth quarter of 2007, as well as deteriorating credit quality in the international loan portfolio. For the year ended November 30, 2006, the provision for loan losses decreased $122.8 million, or 14%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, reflecting improvements in domestic loan losses offset in part by higher losses on international loans. The decrease in net domestic charge offs reflected an acceleration of charge offs in 2005, resulting in lower amounts in 2006, as a result of a decline in bankruptcy receipts following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation, and improved domestic credit and collection experience. In 2006, international loan net charge offs include the impact of the Goldfish acquisition in February 2006. Allowance for Loan Losses The following table provides a summary of the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Balance at beginning of period $ 832,483 $ 838,848 $ 942,721 $ 1,001,656 $ 927,351 Charge offs: Domestic (839,091 ) (852,636 ) (1,076,179 ) (1,061,084 ) (1,246,954 ) International (221,785 ) (148,794 ) (68,177 ) (58,655 ) (56,181 ) Total charge offs (1,060,876 ) (1,001,430 ) (1,144,356 ) (1,119,739 ) (1,303,135 ) Recoveries: Domestic 161,213 154,066 145,642 114,721 96,219 International 27,079 20,418 20,805 16,835 11,452 Total recoveries 188,292 174,484 166,447 131,556 107,671 Net charge offs (872,584 ) (826,946 ) (977,909 ) (988,183 ) (1,195,464 ) Provision for loan losses: Domestic 733,887 606,765 816,197 893,531 1,220,094 International 216,278 148,872 62,289 32,018 46,018 Total provision for loan losses 950,165 755,637 878,486 925,549 1,266,112 Other activity: Domestic (199 ) International: Reserves acquired(1) 55,499 Translation adjustments and other 6,780 9,445 (4,251 ) 3,699 3,656 Total other activity 6,780 64,944 (4,450 ) 3,699 3,656 Balance at end of period $ 916,844 $ 832,483 $ 838,848 $ 942,721 $ 1,001,656 (1) Acquired reserves related to the Goldfish acquisition. 59 Table of Contents The allowance for loan losses increased $84.4 million, or 10%, at November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, reflecting a higher loan portfolio, deterioration in the consumer credit environment in the United Kingdom and higher domestic delinquencies. As a result of the higher domestic delinquencies specifically in the latter months of 2007 coupled with a higher loan portfolio at November 30, 2007, we increased our allowance for loan losses by $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, which accounted for more than the full year change. The allowance for loan losses decreased $6.4 million, or 1%, at November 30, 2006 as compared to November 30, 2005, reflecting improved domestic credit quality offset in part by a decline in international credit quality, recognition of reserves acquired with Goldfish and an increase in the loan portfolio. The factors impacting the changes in credit quality across these periods are discussed further in the net charge offs and delinquency sections below. The following table provides a summary of the composition of the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands): At November 30, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 $ % to Total $ % to Total $ % to Total $ % to Total $ % to Total Domestic $ 759,925 82.9 % $ 703,917 84.6 % $ 795,722 94.9 % $ 910,261 96.6 % $ 963,092 96.1 % International 156,919 17.1 128,566 15.4 43,126 5.1 32,460 3.4 38,564 3.9 Allowance for loan losses at end of period $ 916,844 100.0 % $ 832,483 100.0 % $ 838,848 100.0 % $ 942,721 100.0 % $ 1,001,656 100.0 % The allowance for loan losses is a general allowance that is determined separately for the domestic and international loan portfolios. Accordingly, the percentage of the allowance for loan losses applicable to the domestic and international loan receivables will be a function of both the loan balances and credit quality of each portfolio. The percentage of the total allowance for loan losses applicable to the domestic loan portfolio declined to 82.9% at November 30, 2007 from 84.6% at November 30, 2006. This decrease reflected a higher allowance for loan losses on the international loan portfolio attributable to deteriorating credit quality and a higher level of loan receivables resulting from certain maturing securitizations being retained on the balance sheet. This was offset in part by an increase in the domestic loan portfolio. The percentage of the total allowance for losses applicable to the domestic loan portfolio declined to 84.6% at November 30, 2006 from 94.9% at November 30, 2005. This decrease was due to improved credit quality in the domestic loan portfolio as compared to deterioration in international loan credit quality and a slightly smaller relative percentage of the loan balances composed of domestic loans. In 2006, we recorded an acquired allowance for loan losses related to international loan portfolio acquisitions of $55.5 million. Net Charge offs Our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less current period principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees, current period recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day contractual time frame. The net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period. 60 Table of Contents The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Net Charge offs Domestic $ 677,878 3.40 % $ 698,570 3.63 % $ 930,537 4.93 % $ 946,363 5.71 % $ 1,150,735 6.26 % International 194,706 6.56 % 128,376 4.96 % 47,372 3.33 % 41,820 2.87 % 44,729 2.78 % Total $ 872,584 3.81 % $ 826,946 3.79 % $ 977,909 4.82 % $ 988,183 5.48 % $ 1,195,464 5.98 % The net charge off rate on our total loan receivables increased 2 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, reflecting deteriorating credit quality in the international portfolio and the inclusion of Goldfish loan receivables for a full year, largely offset by sound credit performance in the domestic portfolio. The net charge off rate on our loan receivables decreased 103 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the prior year. The decrease reflected the acceleration of charge offs in the domestic loan portfolio in 2005 related to new bankruptcy legislation, offset in part by deteriorating credit quality in the international portfolio and a higher percentage of international loan receivables in the portfolio as a result of the Goldfish acquisition. The net charge off rate on domestic loan receivables declined 23 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. This decline reflected a continued lower level of bankruptcy related charge offs following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation, offset in part by a higher level of contractual charge offs. The bankruptcy legislation, which made it more difficult for individuals to declare bankruptcy, resulted in a surge in bankruptcy receipts and related charge offs in 2005 and early 2006. Accordingly, the year ended November 30, 2006 was adversely impacted by an elevated level of charge offs in the first quarter. The net charge off rate on domestic loan receivables declined 130 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2006 compared to the prior year, reflecting record low levels of bankruptcy charge offs following the effective date of the legislation, as well as improved credit and collection experience. The net charge off rate on international loan receivables increased 160 basis points and 163 basis points for the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as compared to prior respective periods. These increases were due to legislative changes in the United Kingdom that have led to increased bankruptcy and individual voluntary arrangement filings and a general deterioration in consumer credit quality in the United Kingdom. In addition, the year ended November 30, 2007 reflected the implementation of higher minimum payment requirements on certain accounts as well as a full year of charge offs related to the Goldfish portfolio, which was acquired in February 2006. Delinquencies Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days past due (dollars in thousands): At November 30, Loans over 30 days delinquent 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Domestic $ 678,963 3.26 % $ 633,150 3.05 % $ 756,198 3.67 % $ 790,048 4.18 % $ 990,767 5.51 % International 153,337 4.91 % 128,806 4.36 % 77,919 3.55 % 24,895 2.02 % 39,351 2.84 % Total $ 832,300 3.47 % $ 761,956 3.21 % $ 834,117 3.66 % $ 814,943 4.05 % $ 1,030,118 5.32 % 61 Table of Contents The over 30 day delinquency rate of our total loan portfolio increased 26 basis points to 3.47% at November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, reflecting higher delinquencies in both the domestic and international portfolios. The domestic over 30 day delinquency rate increased 21 basis points to 3.26% at November 30, 2007 as compared to prior year as a result of a weakening U.S. economy. The international over 30 day delinquency rate increased 55 basis points to 4.91% at November 30, 2007 as compared to prior year, reflecting deterioration in consumer credit quality in the United Kingdom and increases in minimum payment requirements on certain accounts. The over 30 day delinquency rate of our total loan portfolio decreased 45 basis points at November 30, 2006 as compared to November 30, 2005, due to improved domestic credit quality partially offset by deteriorating international credit quality and a higher percentage of international loans in loan receivables. The over 30 day delinquency rate of our domestic loan receivables declined 62 basis points at November 30, 2006 compared to prior year due to improved credit quality and collection experience. The over 30 day delinquency rate of our international loan receivables increased 81 basis points at November 30, 2006 as compared to prior year due to a general deterioration in consumer credit quality in the United Kingdom. For 2006, the over 30 day delinquency rates include the impact of the acquisition of the Goldfish business in February 2006. The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables that are accruing interest and are over 90 days delinquent (dollars in thousands): At November 30, Loans over 90 daysdelinquent andaccruing interest 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Domestic $ 271,227 1.30 % $ 244,669 1.18 % $ 263,439 1.28 % $ 342,324 1.81 % $ 409,644 2.28 % International 49,438 1.58 % 38,997 1.32 % 26,640 1.29 % 9,822 0.88 % 12,767 0.95 % Total $ 320,665 1.34 % $ 283,666 1.19 % $ 290,079 1.27 % $ 352,146 1.75 % $ 422,411 2.18 % These loans are included in loan receivables over 30 days delinquent and the related discussion thereof.

Loan receivables are placed on non accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember and as part of certain collection processes. Our loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2007 decreased 15 basis points to 0.92% as compared to November 30, 2006. This decrease was attributable to tighter collection strategies on the international portfolio. Our loans not accruing interest at November 30, 2006 decreased 13 basis points to 1.07% as compared to November 30, 2005, when domestic non accrual loans were elevated due to the surge in bankruptcy receipts before the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation. 62 Table of Contents Other Income The principal component of other income is securitization income. The following table presents the components of other income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2007 vs. 2006increase (decrease) 2006 vs. 2005increase (decrease) 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % Securitization income $ 2,384,487 $ 2,338,405 $ 1,608,928 $ 46,082 2 % $ 729,477 45 % Loan fee income 387,203 369,449 338,169 17,754 5 % 31,280 9 % Discount and interchange revenue(1) 263,913 365,986 618,158 (102,073 ) (28 %) (252,172 ) (41 %) Insurance 202,164 188,160 168,791 14,004 7 % 19,369 11 % Merchant fees 92,518 109,230 72,871 (16,712 ) (15 %) 36,359 50 % Transaction processing revenue 99,653 94,472 86,903 5,181 5 % 7,569 9 % Other income 116,181 73,237 43,217 42,944 59 % 30,020 69 % Total other income $ 3,546,119 $ 3,538,939 $ 2,937,037 $ 7,180 0 % $ 601,902 20 % (1) Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $787 million, $767 million and $659 million for the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Total other income was relatively flat for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, as higher securitization income and other income were offset by lower discount and interchange revenue. Total other income increased $601.9 million, or 20%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to higher securitization income. Securitization income in 2006 benefited from a favorable revaluation of the interest only strip receivable reflecting higher excess spread projections as a result of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation which became effective in October 2005. Securitization income in 2005 was negatively impacted by the effect of the anticipated level of charge offs on the projected excess spread which in turn adversely affected the valuation of the interest only strip receivable. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. Within other income, this change to allocating discount and interchange revenue has the effect of decreasing discount and interchange revenue and increasing securitization income. The amount of discount and interchange revenue allocated to securitization income has increased since this change was made in 2004 and is expected to continue increasing as new transactions which include allocations are completed and securitization transactions that did not receive allocations mature. For the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, there were 69%, 54% and 22%, respectively, of average securitized loans to which discount and interchange revenue was allocated. To broaden merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards, we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late 2006. In addition, we are selling small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and reduce costs. As the outsourcing continues, merchant discount will be replaced by acquirer interchange and assessments, which will reduce the percentage of income per transaction and, over time, operating expenses as we no longer incur costs to acquire and service small and mid sized merchants. The lower cost per transaction is expected to be offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance. Any gains on the sale of merchant acquiring portfolios will be reflected in other income as earned. 63 Table of Contents Securitization Income Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through asset securitizations and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card receivables we originated. The issuance of asset backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from the consolidated and combined statements of financial condition. Also, portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interest in those transactions. Investors in securitizations are allocated the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue earned on securitized loans. In addition, for domestic securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. These cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows remaining are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests. Securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans. For the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the average securitized loans were $28.5 billion, $26.6 billion and $27.4 billion, respectively. The table below presents the components of securitization income (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2007 vs. 2006increase (decrease) 2006 vs. 2005increase (decrease) 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % Excess spread $ 1,792,330 $ 1,662,355 $ 1,158,331 $ 129,975 8 % $ 504,024 44 % Servicing fees on securitized loans 569,215 535,985 548,694 33,230 6 % (12,709 ) (2 %) Net revaluation of retained interests 44,878 159,442 (78,474 ) (114,564 ) (72 %) 237,916 303 % Other (principally transaction costs) (21,936 ) (19,377 ) (19,623 ) (2,559 ) (13 %) 246 1 % Total securitization income $ 2,384,487 $ 2,338,405 $ 1,608,928 $ 46,082 2 % $ 729,477 45 % For the year ended November 30, 2007, securitization income increased $46.1 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The increase reflects higher excess spread and servicing fees related to a higher level of average securitized loans, offset in part by a lower net revaluation of retained interests. For the year ended November 30, 2006, securitization income increased $729.5 million, or 45%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005. The increase reflects a higher excess spread on securitized loans and a higher net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable, both of which were offset in part by a lower level of average securitized loans. 64 Table of Contents Excess spread. The following table provides the components of excess spread (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2007 vs. 2006increase (decrease) 2006 vs. 2005increase (decrease) 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % Interest income on securitized loans $ 3,972,350 $ 3,708,959 $ 3,529,586 $ 263,391 7 % $ 179,373 5 % Interest paid to investors in asset backed securities (1,593,373 ) (1,397,549 ) (1,024,618 ) (195,824 ) (14 %) (372,931 ) (36 %) Net interest income 2,378,977 2,311,410 2,504,968 67,567 3 % (193,558 ) (8 %) Other fee revenue on securitized loans(1) 1,203,245 1,032,937 713,650 170,308 16 % 319,287 45 % Net charge offs on securitized loans (1,220,677 ) (1,146,007 ) (1,511,593 ) (74,670 ) (7 %) 365,586 24 % Net revenues on securitized loans 2,361,545 2,198,340 1,707,025 163,205 7 % 491,315 29 % Servicing fees on securitized loans (569,215 ) (535,985 ) (548,694 ) (33,230 ) (6 %) 12,709 2 % Excess spread $ 1,792,330 $ 1,662,355 $ 1,158,331 $ 129,975 8 % $ 504,024 44 % (1) Other fee income includes discount and interchange revenue, loan fee income and insurance (credit fee products) revenues. For the year ended November 30, 2007, excess spread on securitized loans increased $130.0 million, or 8%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due primarily to a higher level of average securitized loans and other fee revenue on securitized loans resulting from the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. Although net interest income increased as a result of the higher level of average securitized loans, the net interest spread for the year ended November 30, 2007 was lower due to a higher rate of return paid on floating rate investor interests due to higher average LIBOR. For the year ended November 30, 2006, excess spread on securitized loans increased $504.0 million, or 44%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005. The higher excess spread reflects lower net charge offs and higher other fee revenue, partially offset by lower net interest income. The decrease in net charge offs reflects the improved credit quality following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation. The increase in other fee income reflects a higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving merchant discount and interchange revenue. The decrease in net interest income is primarily attributable to a higher rate of return paid to investors reflecting the impact of the rising interest rate environment on floating rate investor interests. Servicing fees on securitized loans. We are paid a servicing fee for the cash flows generated by the securitized loans. These cash flows include interest income and loan fee income as well as discount and interchange revenue for certain securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2007, servicing fees increased $33.2 million, or 6%, from the prior year due to a higher level of securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2006, servicing fees decreased $12.7 million, or 2% from the prior year due to a lower level of securitized loans in comparison to the prior year. 65 Table of Contents Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2007 vs. 2006increase (decrease) 2006 vs. 2005increase (decrease) 2007 2006 2005 $ $ Initial gain on new securitization transactions $ 122,949 $ 103,805 $ 81,947 $ 19,144 $ 21,858 Revaluation of retained interests (78,071 ) 55,637 (160,421 ) (133,708 ) 216,058 Net revaluation of retained interests $ 44,878 $ 159,442 $ (78,474 ) $ (114,564 ) $ 237,916 The net revaluation of retained interests includes the initial gain on securitized loan receivables against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties and changes in the fair value of retained interests, principally the interest only strip receivable. The net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable represents changes in the estimated present value of certain components of excess spread on the securitized loans to be earned in the future. Changes in the maturity profile and the estimate of performance measures of the securitized loans, such as interest yield and charge offs, as well as changes in the interest rate environment, can affect future excess spread projections and, accordingly, the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2007 decreased to $44.9 million as compared to $159.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2006. The negative net revaluation of retained interests of $78.1 million for the year ended November 30, 2007 was primarily attributable to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions. This was offset in part by higher projected excess spread at November 30, 2007, reflecting the lower absolute interest rate environment as compared to that assumed at prior year end. The year ended November 30, 2007 also reflected a higher initial gain as a result of a higher level of new securitization transactions as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2006 increased to $159.4 million as compared to a net negative revaluation of $78.5 million for the year ended November 30, 2005. The net positive revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2006 was favorably impacted by the effect of lower charge offs following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation on the interest only strip receivable. Additionally, during the year ended November 30, 2006, there was a higher level of new credit card securitization transactions as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, as well as a decrease in net gain amortization related to prior securitization transactions. Loan Fee Income Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, balance transfer, cash advance and other miscellaneous fees. Loan fee income increased $17.8 million, or 5%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, reflecting higher balance transfer fees partially offset by lower late and overlimit fees. Loan fee income increased $31.3 million, or 9%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily due to portfolio growth in the United Kingdom related to the Goldfish acquisition as well as lower fee net charge offs and waivers and higher balance transfer fees in the United States. Discount and Interchange Revenue Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers in the United States, and issuer interchange revenue in the United Kingdom. In the United States, we earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardmember purchase transactions and acquirer interchange revenue from 66 Table of Contents merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by cardholders at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organizations transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. In the United Kingdom, where we issue MasterCard and Visa branded cards, we earn interchange revenue from transactions processed by those networks. We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmembers purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which results in a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and an increase in securitization income. However, cardmember rewards costs associated with the securitized loans are not allocated to investor interests, and as such, do not impact securitization income. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $102.1 million, or 28%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due to higher allocations to securitized loans which have the effect of reclassifying discount and interchange revenue to securitization income and higher cardmember rewards, partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue earned related to increased sales volume. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving allocations than in 2006. The increase in cardmember rewards reflected higher sales volume. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $252.2 million, or 41%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, due to higher allocations to securitized loans which have the effect of reclassifying discount and interchange revenue to securitization income, and due to higher cardmember rewards partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue earned. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving allocations than in 2005. This adverse effect on discount and interchange revenue was partially offset by higher sales volume in 2006 reflecting increased cardmember usage and the acquisition of Goldfish in February 2006. The increase in cardmember rewards reflected higher sales volume and the impact of promotional programs which offer certain cardmembers additional rewards for various types of purchases. Insurance (Credit Fee Products) We earn revenue primarily related to fees received for marketing credit related ancillary products including insurance, debt deferment/debt cancellation contracts and credit protection services to cardmembers. The amount of revenue recorded is based on the terms of the insurance policies and contracts with third party providers. We do not retain any significant underwriting loss exposure. We recognize this income over the policy or contract period as earned. Insurance income increased $14.0 million, or 7%, for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily related to higher credit protection revenue. Insurance income increased $19.4 million, or 11%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to increased cardmember participation resulting from the Goldfish acquisition. Merchant Fees Merchant fees consist primarily of fees charged to merchants for various services including manual authorization of transactions and delivery of hardcopy statements. Merchant fees decreased $16.7 million, or 15%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006 due to increased outsourcing to merchant acquirers. Merchant fees increased $36.4 million, or 50%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, due to an increase in pricing on certain fees. As merchant 67 Table of Contents acquiring portfolios are sold to third party merchant acquirers, this revenue will decrease along with associated costs. Transaction Processing Revenue Transaction processing revenues include switch fees charged to financial institutions for accessing the PULSE Network to process transactions and various participation and membership fees. Switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. Transactions processing revenue increased $5.2 million, or 5%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by pricing incentives. Transaction processing revenue increased $7.6 million, or 9%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, related to an increased volume of transactions processed on the network. Transaction processing revenue was a new revenue source in 2005 introduced by our acquisition of PULSE in January 2005. Other Income Other income includes revenues on various fee based products, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts, gains on sales of mortgage loans, investment gains and losses, and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income increased $42.9 million, or 59%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006 related to gains from sales of merchant contracts and revenue from the referral of declined applications. This increase was partially offset by losses recorded in recognizing our interest rate swap agreements at their fair values prior to re designation of hedge accounting in the third quarter of 2007. Other income increased $30.0 million, or 69%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to increased revenue from the referral of declined applications and an increase in unrealized gains on derivative transactions. Other Expense The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2007 vs. 2006 increase (decrease) 2006 vs. 2005 increase (decrease) 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 922,089 $ 933,196 $ 869,635 $ (11,107 ) (1 %) $ 63,561 7 % Marketing and business development 610,205 603,556 586,801 6,649 1 % 16,755 3 % Information processing and communications 388,065 387,595 353,054 470 0 % 34,541 10 % Professional fees 391,024 367,769 292,966 23,255 6 % 74,803 26 % Premises and equipment 91,531 92,278 91,032 (747 ) (1 %) 1,246 1 % Goodwill and intangible impairment loss(1) 391,119 391,119 NM Other expense 362,479 335,089 339,139 27,390 8 % (4,050 ) (1 %) Total other expense(1) $ 3,156,512 $ 2,719,483 $ 2,532,627 $ 437,029 16 % $ 186,856 7 % (1) 2007 includes a $391 million non cash impairment charge related to our International Card segment. Total other expense increased $437.0 million, or 16%, for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily related to a $391 million goodwill and intangible impairment loss in November 2007. Total other expense increased $186.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to higher employee compensation and benefits and professional fees. 68 Table of Contents Employee Compensation and Benefits Employee compensation and benefits decreased $11.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily related to a decrease in overhead allocations from Morgan Stanley as a result of the Distribution and lower benefit and commission costs partially offset by higher salaries and higher amortization related to Founders Grant awards. Employee compensation and benefits increased $63.6 million, or 7%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to additional employees acquired with the Goldfish business, increased employee salary levels and benefit costs and incremental compensation related to equity awards granted to our retirement eligible employees. Marketing and Business Development Marketing and business development increased $6.6 million, or 1%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, related to increased acquisition spending partially offset by reduced advertising. Marketing and business development increased $16.8 million, or 3%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, due to increased acquisition expenses related to the launch of the Discover Business Card and other new products and managements continued focus on receivables growth. Information Processing and Communications Information processing and communications for the year ended November 30, 2007 was relatively unchanged as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. Information processing and communications increased $34.5 million, or 10%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to additional processing costs as a result of the Goldfish acquisition and increased transaction volume on the PULSE Network. Professional Fees Professional fees increased $23.3 million, or 6%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily due to spin off related costs partially offset by lower overhead allocations from Morgan Stanley as a result of the Distribution. Professional fees increased $74.8 million, or 26%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to increased legal fees and consulting costs. The increase in legal fees was primarily driven by costs associated with our lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard. Consulting costs increased due to investments in the Discover Business Card and various other business initiatives. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment decreased $0.7 million, or 1%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, and increased $1.2 million, or 1%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, See Note 7: Premises and Equipment to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information related to premises and equipment. Goodwill and Intangible Impairment Loss For the year ended November 30, 2007, a non cash impairment charge of $391 million was recorded in the International Card segment, related to our Goldfish business in the United Kingdom. The charge was comprised of a $291 million goodwill impairment, a $55 million impairment of trade name intangibles and a $45 million impairment of purchased credit cardholder relationships (PCCRs). There were no such impairment charges in either of the two prior years. 69 Table of Contents Management completed a strategic review of the International Card segment in the fourth quarter of 2007. As a result, management revised its long range projections for the International Card segment, and these projections were used as the basis for a revised estimate of the segments fair value. The International Card segment comprises a single reporting unit for purposes of goodwill allocation under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (Statement No. 142). The carrying value of this reporting unit was in excess of its revised estimated fair value, indicating that goodwill was impaired. Based on evaluation of the estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, management concluded that goodwill had an implied fair value of zero, and accordingly, the $291 million carrying value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit was written off. In conjunction with the strategic review and prior to testing goodwill for impairment, management evaluated the PCCRs and trade name intangibles associated with the International Card segment to determine whether the carrying values of those assets were recoverable from the future cash flow estimates indicated by the revised long term projections. Based on those evaluations, neither asset group was deemed to be entirely recoverable from expected future cash flows, and accordingly, each was written down to its estimated fair value as required by Statement No. 142. These write downs, totaling $100 million before taxes, consisted of $45 million related to PCCRs and $55 million related to trade name intangibles. See Note 9: Goodwill and Note 10: Other Intangible Assets to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further details concerning these impairment charges. Other Expense Other expense increased $27.4 million, or 8%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily related to higher fraud expense and higher transactional related tax expense related to the International Card segment. Other expense decreased $4.0 million, or 1%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to lower fraud expense and legal accruals partially offset by higher franchise taxes, amortization of intangibles and cost associated with new account acquisitions. Income Tax Expense Income tax expense decreased $149.1 million, or 29%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, reflecting a decrease in pretax income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate increased to 37.7% for the year ended November 30, 2007 from 32.0% for the year ended November 30, 2006. The year ended November 30, 2006 benefited from a favorable resolution of tax examination issues addressed during the course of a federal tax audit for the years 1997 through 1998 and the favorable settlement of state tax matters. The year ended November 30, 2007, includes the impact of filing state combined returns exclusive of Morgan Stanley as well as the International Card segment impairment and rewards program benefits. Income tax expense increased $159.3 million, or 46%, for the year ended November 30, 2006 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2005, reflecting an increase in pretax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased to 32.0% for the year ended November 30, 2006 from 37.5% for the year ended November 30, 2005, primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax examination issues addressed during the course of a federal tax audit for the years 1997 through 1998 as well as the favorable settlement of state tax matters. 70 Table of Contents Quarterly Results The following table presents results on a quarterly basis (dollars in thousands): For the Three Months Ended November 30,2007 August 31,2007 May 31,2007 February 28,2007 Interest income $ 748,889 $ 755,610 $ 703,365 $ 680,305 Interest expense 400,734 361,469 336,253 283,959 Net interest income 348,155 394,141 367,112 396,346 Provision for loan losses 339,916 211,576 203,287 195,386 Other income 1,003,251 845,498 871,693 825,677 Other expense(1) 1,099,495 698,849 702,992 655,176 Income before income tax expense (benefit)(1) (88,005 ) 329,214 332,526 371,461 Income tax expense (benefit)(1) (31,521 ) 126,974 123,284 137,829 Net income (loss)(1) $ (56,484 ) $ 202,240 $ 209,242 $ 233,632 (1) November 30, 2007 includes a $391 million pretax ($279 million after tax) non cash impairment charge related to our International Card segment. Liquidity and Capital Resources We seek to maintain liquidity, capital and funding policies that ensure our credit ratings and bank capitalization levels are sufficient to provide cost effective access to debt and deposit markets thus providing sufficient liquidity to fund our business. Our liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk is addressed through various funding criteria and targets that guide our access to the long term and short term debt capital markets, the maturity profile of our liabilities, the diversity of our funding sources and investor base, as well as the level of our liquidity reserve as part of a contingency funding plan. We attempt to ensure that the maturity of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including the liquidity position, which measures funding in various maturity tranches. The maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are staggered. The mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to ensure appropriate diversification. Funding sources include externally derived short term borrowings, asset backed commercial paper conduit financing, long term asset backed securitizations, bank deposits and bank notes. Corporate Treasury monitors and reviews liquidity and capital management policies and executes strategies to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and capital. Our senior management reviews financial performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative financing sources, evaluates liquidity risk and capital adequacy, and assesses the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. In light of the Distribution, total intercompany balances from Morgan Stanley were entirely replaced with certificates of deposit, external deposits from broker dealers, external secured borrowings, unsecured long term debt and asset backed financing. In June 2007, funding sourced through the Morgan Stanley Global Wealth Management Bank Deposit Program was replaced through the issuance of deposits and the use of alternative external broker dealer client funds deposited into Discover Bank. Also in June, we facilitated the repayment of short and long term borrowings from Morgan Stanley through the issuance of new debt. Specifically, we replaced short term borrowings related to our cash collateral accounts with external secured financing arrangements, and short term borrowings related to our fixed assets with our own long term debt. In June 2007, we also structured external secured financing agreements to replace short and long term borrowings related to our International Card segment. 71 Table of Contents Management has implemented liquidity and capital management policies which seek to provide us with adequate access to and supply of funding through the business cycle. Accordingly, management has maintained an investment grade rating at Discover Bank and received an investment grade rating for Discover Financial Services following the Distribution. Discover Bank has maintained its BBB rating from S&P and has been assigned a Baa2 deposit and Baa2 senior unsecured rating from Moodys and a BBB rating from Fitch. Discover Financial Services has been assigned a BBB long term rating from S&P, a Baa3 senior unsecured rating from Moodys and a BBB long term rating from Fitch. In light of the Distribution, we modified our Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) to eliminate reliance on Morgan Stanley sourced funding while limiting our access to the asset backed and certificate of deposit markets. Our CFP model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to: (i) repayment of all debt maturing within one year; (ii) expected funding requirements from receivable growth and or volatility; and (iii) customer cash withdrawals from interest bearing deposits. If we are unable to continue to securitize our credit card receivables at acceptable pricing levels, or at all, including by reason of the early amortization of any of our securitization transactions, we would seek to liquidate investment securities, increase bank deposits and use alternative funding sources (such as federal funds, bank notes, and unsecured debt) to fund increases in loan receivables and meet our other liquidity needs. By June 30, 2007, in anticipation of the Distribution, we enhanced our liquidity by increasing the amount of our liquidity reserve to target $5 billion (with a $5.1 billion balance as of June 30, 2007), increasing committed undrawn securitization conduit facilities to approximately $2.4 billion and negotiating a $2.5 billion unsecured committed credit facility that became effective on July 2, 2007. Through the establishment of these liquidity sources, we expect to manage a CFP that is designed to withstand a Discover stress event characterized by limited access to the brokered deposit and asset backed securitization markets. Throughout the second half of 2007, the ongoing disruptions in the debt and asset backed capital markets caused the LIBOR and asset backed commercial paper rates to rise, credit spreads to widen materially and reduced availability of new issuance in some funding markets. In response to various liquidity events, our senior management increased liquidity targets. As of November 30, 2007, our contingent sources included approximately $8.3 billion in our liquidity reserve (primarily invested in Fed Funds sold and bank deposits), $1.9 billion of unutilized commitments from third party commercial paper asset backed conduits for securitization funding, and $2.5 billion of unsecured committed credit. In addition, we had AAA note issuance capacity of $2.75 billion in the Discover Card Execution Note Trust structure. Our consolidated statement of financial condition at November 30, 2007 consisted primarily of credit card loan receivables, of which 87% were originated in the U.S. and 13% in the United Kingdom. The balance of credit card receivables fluctuates from time to time due to trends in credit card spending and payments, as well as the issuance of new securitization transactions and maturities of existing securitization transactions. Our credit card loan receivables provide us with flexibility in financing and managing our business, as the market for financing credit card loan receivables is generally large and active. Equity Capital Management. Our senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. We determine the level of capital necessary to support our business based on our managed credit card loan receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, taking into account, among other things, regulatory requirements, rating agency guidelines and internally managed requirements to sustain growth. At the time of the Distribution, we targeted approximately $5.5 billion of capital as appropriate to support the Distribution, made a dividend of $350 million in June 2007 to Morgan Stanley, and received an equity infusion from Morgan Stanley in the amount of $135 million to further adjust our capital to its appropriate level. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC insured financial institutions must maintain minimum levels of capital that are dependent upon the risk of the financial institutions assets, specifically (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (leverage ratio), (b) 4% to 6% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio) 72 Table of Contents and (c) 8% to 10% of total capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (total risk weighted capital ratio). At November 30, 2007, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio and total risk weighted capital ratio of Discover Bank as well as our other FDIC insured financial institution, Bank of New Castle, exceeded these regulatory minimums. Dividend Policy. Although we intend to reinvest a substantial portion of our earnings in our business, we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, as a result of applicable banking regulations and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may further be limited. Stock Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, Discover Financial Services announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Discover Financial Services outstanding stock under a new share repurchase program. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. Special Dividend. On June 19, 2007, we declared a special dividend to Morgan Stanley. Pursuant to the special dividend, upon resolution of our outstanding litigation with Visa U.S.A., Inc. and MasterCard Worldwide, after expenses incurred by us in connection with such litigation, we are required to pay Morgan Stanley (1) the first $700 million of value of cash or non cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the minimum proceeds) and (2) 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by us to Morgan Stanley will be net of taxes payable by us with respect to such proceeds. If, in connection with or following a change in control of our company, the litigation is settled for an amount less than minimum proceeds, we are required to pay Morgan Stanley an amount equal to the minimum proceeds. A copy of the special dividend is attached as Schedule 2 to the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Morgan Stanley and us that was filed by us on a Current Report on Form 8 K on July 5, 2007. Short Term Borrowings. Short term borrowings consist of term, overnight Federal Funds purchased and other short term borrowings with original maturities less than one year. The following table identifies the balances and weighted average interest rates on short term borrowings outstanding at and for the years ended (dollars in thousands): November 30, 2007 November 30, 2006 November 30, 2005 MaximumMonth End BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate MaximumMonth End BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate MaximumMonthEnd BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate Domestic: Overnight Federal Funds purchased $ 3,430,000 $ 250,000 4.68 % $ 3,000,000 $ 3,000,000 5.31 % $ 934,000 $ Term Federal Funds purchased $ 540,000 $ 1,769,000 100,000 5.35 % $ 1,865,000 Other short term borrowings $ 2,106,124 $ 4,655,321 1,811,124 5.46 % $ 3,447,064 1,845,910 4.20 % International: Other short term borrowings $ 3,052,739 2,925,426 6.11 % $ 2,186,646 1,828,554 5.25 % $ 1,927,150 1,927,150 4.81 % Total short term borrowings $ 3,175,426 5.99 % $ 6,739,678 5.34 % $ 3,773,060 4.51 % 73 Table of Contents On June 20, 2007, we received proceeds of $2.7 billion related to the issuance of debt by unrelated conduit providers. The transaction was structured as a borrowing secured by the performance of the owned credit card receivables of the International Card segment. The financing arrangement, which has a flexible term of up to 364 days, facilitated the pay down of short term and long term borrowings with Morgan Stanley. As of November 30, 2007, the balance of this structured secured borrowing was $2.9 billion. Deposits. We utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short term credit sensitive funding sources, thus enhancing our liquidity position. We obtain our deposits through various channels: direct retail certificates of deposit and money market accounts, retail and institutional brokerage arrangements and money market accounts, under which we receive funds swept through external third parties. Direct consumer retail deposits are marketed to and received from individual customers, without the use of a third party intermediary, and are an important, stable funding source that typically reacts more slowly to interest rate changes than other deposits. Brokered deposits are deposits placed to consumers through registered brokers. These deposits typically provide funding with maturities ranging from one month to ten years. Total interest bearing deposits of $24.6 billion increased $11.4 billion from November 30, 2006. The increase from prior year end reflected the replacement of funding sourced from Morgan Stanley to funding sourced by us in anticipation of the Distribution. In addition, the increase in deposits also financed the increase in our liquidity portfolio. At November 30, 2007, the weighted average maturity of all certificates of deposit was approximately 22 months. Prior to the Distribution, Discover Bank received funds from Morgan Stanley sourced money market accounts obtained through the Morgan Stanley Global Wealth Management Bank Deposit Program, under which we received funds swept directly from certain Morgan Stanley Global Wealth Management clients. We began participating in this program in the second quarter of 2006, accumulating a balance of $3.0 billion by May 31, 2007. Morgan Stanley subsequently withdrew all these deposits on June 11, 2007, in anticipation of the Distribution. Beginning in the second quarter of 2007, Discover Bank entered into similar agreements with third parties, accumulating balances of $2.9 billion in aggregate at November 30, 2007. The following table summarizes the remaining maturities of our interest bearing deposits at November 30, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Total ThreeMonths orLess Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths Over TwelveMonths Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000 $ 19,385,024 $ 2,532,031 $ 2,120,911 $ 4,632,848 $ 10,099,234 Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or greater 775,717 408,572 47,275 130,801 189,069 Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts 4,482,776 4,482,776 Total interest bearing deposits $ 24,643,517 $ 7,423,379 $ 2,168,186 $ 4,763,649 $ 10,288,303 Long Term Debt and Bank Notes. An additional source of funding is provided by our Global Bank Note Program. The program was launched in 2004 by Discover Bank. Bank notes may be issued under this program with maturities of thirty days or more from the date of issuance. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, we had $250 million par value in bank notes outstanding which mature in February 2009. On June 12, 2007, we received proceeds on the issuance of $800 million par value of unsecured debt to external third parties. The financing is comprised of $400 million having a three year maturity with a floating coupon and $400 million with a ten year maturity with a fixed coupon. The transaction provided additional liquidity to us to support funding requirements of our subsidiaries. 74 Table of Contents Securitization Financing. We also generate a significant portion of our funding through the securitization of credit card loan receivables utilizing non consolidated securitization trusts. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are accounted for as sold and, accordingly, are removed from the consolidated and combined statements of financial condition. We have historically securitized between approximately 50% and 60% of our managed credit card loan receivables. We utilize both the term securitization market as well as the privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduit financing market. Outstanding term financing and asset backed commercial paper conduit financing at November 30, 2007 were $25.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2007, we had $1.9 billion in unused asset backed commercial paper conduit capacity. The following table summarizes expected maturities of the investors interests in securitizations at November 30, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years After FiveYears Expected maturities of the investors interest in securitizations $ 28,212,725 $ 8,338,929 $ 11,069,512 $ 6,024,511 $ 2,779,773 We access the term asset securitization market through the Discover Card Master Trust I and, beginning July 26, 2007, the Discover Card Execution Note Trust using receivables generated by our U.S. Card business. Through the Discover Card Master Trust I, we have been using a structure utilizing Class A, triple A rated certificates and Class B, single A rated certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates and a cash collateral account. The Discover Card Execution Note Trust includes three classes of securities sold to investors, the most senior class generally receiving a triple A rating. In this structure, in order to issue senior, higher rated, classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower rated classes of notes. As of November 30, 2007, cash collateral accounts underlying the securitization transactions of Discover Card Master Trust I had a balance of $1.8 billion. Discover Financial Services financed $1.7 billion of cash collateral accounts (reflected in amounts due from asset securitizations in the consolidated and combined statements of financial condition). The rights to repayment of a portion of the cash collateral account loans have been sold to a special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, as part of a $1.1 billion secured financing and are not expected to be available to creditors of Discover Financial Services. The following table summarizes estimated maturities of the cash collateral accounts at November 30, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThreeYears FourYearsThroughFive Years After FiveYears Estimated maturities of cash collateral accounts $ 1,665,734 $ 561,209 $ 636,824 $ 315,956 $ 151,745 In our International Card segment, we access the term asset backed securitization market through the Cumbernauld Funding plc master trust. Through this trust, we have traditionally utilized a structure having Class A, triple A rated notes, with credit enhancement provided by subordination through the over collateralization of receivables and a cash collateral account. The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature 75 Table of Contents relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (economic early amortization). In the event of an economic early amortization (which would occur if the excess spread falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three month average), the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities. As of November 30, 2007, no economic early amortization events have occurred. The table below provides information concerning investor interest and related excess spreads at November 30, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Investor Interest # of SeriesOutstanding 3 Month RollingAverage ExcessSpread Interchange series(1) $ 17,043,165 19 8.53 % Non interchange series 6,970,508 7 5.16 % Discover Card Master Trust I 24,013,673 26 5.16 % Discover Card Execution Note Trust 2,965,000 6 7.82 % Cumbernauld Funding plc 1,234,052 1 3.81 % Total Company $ 28,212,725 33 (1) Discover Card Master Trust I certificates issued subsequent to and including series 2004 1 include cash flows derived from discount and interchange revenue earned by Discover Bank. Secured Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources. In connection with our asset securitization program, we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through third party bank sponsored securitization conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At November 30, 2007, these conduits totaled $5.1 billion, of which $1.9 billion was unused. These facilities are 364 day agreements and are reviewed for renewal annually. Unsecured Committed Credit Facilities. In light of the Distribution, we negotiated a 59 month unsecured committed credit facility of $2.5 billion that will serve to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility became effective at the time of the Distribution, is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank. We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements See Liquidity and Capital Resources Securitization Financing. Guarantees Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed through the Discover Network and cardmember related services provided to U.K. cardmembers. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement. At November 30, 2007, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our consolidated statement of financial condition related to these transactions. See Note 20: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 76 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2007, include long term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2007 are summarized below (dollars in thousands): Payments Due By Period Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThreeYears Four YearsThroughFive Years More ThanFive Years Deposits(1) $ 24,725,401 $ 14,151,984 $ 7,883,949 $ 1,508,513 $ 1,180,955 Bank notes(2) 250,000 250,000 Secured borrowings(3) 1,080,063 397,606 376,141 306,316 Unsecured borrowings(4) 800,000 400,000 400,000 Capital lease obligations(5) 4,952 1,306 2,871 775 Operating leases(5) 30,786 7,623 13,962 6,787 2,414 Interest payments on fixed rate debt 245,888 25,800 51,600 51,600 116,888 Total contractual obligations $ 27,137,090 $ 14,584,319 $ 8,978,523 $ 1,873,991 $ 1,700,257 (1) See Note 11: Deposits to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our deposits. The certificates of deposit accrue interest at fixed rates. All other interest bearing deposits accrue interest at variable rates. (2) See Note 13: Long Term Borrowings to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $15.3 million as of November 30, 2007, utilizing the current interest rate of 5.03% at November 30, 2007. (3) Interest charges on secured borrowings, of which the full repayment is dependent upon the available balances of the cash collateral accounts at the maturities of the underlying securitization transactions, are based on a fifty basis point spread over monthly commercial paper issuance costs. See Note 13: Long Term Borrowings to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $108.6 million as of November 30, 2007, utilizing the current interest rate of 5.67% at November 30, 2007. (4) See Note 13: Long Term Borrowings to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate note is estimated to be $63.9 million as of November 30, 2007, utilizing the current interest rate of 6.23% at November 30, 2007. Total future payment of interest charges for the fixed rate note is equal to the amount reported included in the table above under Interest payments on fixed rate debt. (5) See Note 20: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our capital and operating lease obligations. At November 30, 2007, we extended credit for consumer and commercial loans of approximately $265 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees are included in our consolidated and combined financial statements. 77 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and to a lesser degree, foreign currency exchange rates. Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally credit card loan receivables, Federal Funds sold, money market funds and other assets as well as excess spread received in connection with the securitized loan receivables against which beneficial interests have been issued. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, long term borrowings, and deposits. Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables as well as our right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed or floating rate credit card loan receivables to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate. See Note 22: Fair Value Disclosures to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our derivative financial instruments. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. The Companys interest rate sensitive assets include Federal Funds sold, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest earning deposits in other banks, certain investment securities and loan receivables. Portions of our credit card loan receivables have fixed interest rates, although we have the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate unless the account has been closed or the cardmember opts out. Therefore, we consider a portion of the credit card loan receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. We measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into consideration the required notice period. In addition, assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. 78 Table of Contents Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of November 30, 2007, we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities over the following 12 month period would be reduced by approximately $113 million. We estimate the comparable reduction of pretax income for the 12 month period following November 30, 2006 to be approximately $125 million. The hypothetical decline in pretax income was lower than the prior year due to a higher level of other interest earning assets related to the liquidity reserve partially offset by a higher level of variable rate funding at November 30, 2007. The model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at the fiscal period end will remain constant over the next 12 month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how we would respond to significant changes in market conditions such as those recently experienced. Furthermore, the analysis does not necessarily reflect our expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. Changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar may impact earnings and capital translated from international operations. Our U.K. business generates credit card loan receivables denominated in pounds sterling which is primarily funded by the issuance of debt by unrelated conduit providers and intercompany lending. We have hedged foreign exchange exposure related to intercompany lending with our International Card segment through the use of forward contracts. We monitor and manage our exposure to reflect the risk tolerance established by our senior management. We expect to continue to monitor foreign exchange exposure created as a result of our net investment in international operations and to manage these risks within our risk management guidelines. 79 Table of Contents
