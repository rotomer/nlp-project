Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. The combined financial information may not be indicative of our future performance or of the results that would have been achieved had we operated as a separate, stand alone entity during the periods presented, including changes that occurred in our operations and capitalization as a result of our spin off from Morgan Stanley. Included in the selected historical financial data are certain amounts and statistics reported on a managed basis. Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided sellers interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is not a presentation in accordance with GAAP, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income.

(3) On June 30, 2007, the Distribution by Morgan Stanley was completed to the Morgan Stanley stockholders of one share of Discover Financial Services common stock for every two shares of Morgan Stanley common stock held on June 18, 2007. As a result, on July 2, 2007, we had 477,235,927 shares of common stock outstanding and this share amount is being utilized for the calculation of basic EPS for all periods presented prior to the date of Distribution. For all periods prior to the date of Distribution, the same number of shares is being used for diluted EPS as for basic EPS as no common stock of Discover Financial Services was traded prior to July 2, 2007 and no Discover equity awards were outstanding for the prior periods. 43 Table of Contents For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Selected Statistics: Total Loan Receivables Loan receivables owned $ 25,216,611 $ 20,831,117 $ 20,790,244 $ 20,611,306 $ 18,894,120 Average loan receivables owned $ 21,348,493 $ 19,947,784 $ 19,252,929 $ 18,875,378 $ 16,579,750 Owned interest yield 10.89 % 10.73 % 10.48 % 10.12 % 10.09 % Owned net principal charge off rate 4.59 % 3.40 % 3.63 % 4.93 % 5.71 % Owned delinquency rate (over 30 days) 4.35 % 3.26 % 3.05 % 3.67 % 4.17 % Owned delinquency rate (over 90 days) 2.06 % 1.51 % 1.43 % 1.60 % 2.02 % Loan receivables managed $ 51,095,278 $ 48,180,436 $ 45,802,071 $ 44,437,450 $ 45,978,638 Average loan receivables managed $ 49,011,148 $ 46,913,474 $ 44,409,232 $ 44,967,420 $ 45,369,518 Managed interest yield 12.61 % 12.65 % 12.52 % 11.75 % 11.88 % Managed net principal charge off rate 5.01 % 3.83 % 3.95 % 5.29 % 6.10 % Managed delinquency rate (over 30 days) 4.56 % 3.58 % 3.39 % 3.97 % 4.64 % Managed delinquency rate (over 90 days) 2.17 % 1.67 % 1.59 % 1.74 % 2.23 % Total Credit Card Loan Receivables Credit card loan receivables owned $ 23,814,307 $ 20,579,923 $ 20,694,395 $ 20,434,977 $ 18,606,211 Average credit card loan receivables owned $ 20,566,864 $ 19,845,880 $ 19,120,946 $ 18,644,660 $ 16,228,520 Owned interest yield 10.92 % 10.75 % 10.50 % 10.16 % 10.13 % Owned net principal charge off rate 4.73 % 3.41 % 3.64 % 4.95 % 5.75 % Owned delinquency rate (over 30 days) 4.55 % 3.28 % 3.05 % 3.69 % 4.19 % Owned delinquency rate (over 90 days) 2.16 % 1.53 % 1.44 % 1.61 % 2.03 % Credit card loan receivables managed $ 49,692,974 $ 47,929,242 $ 45,706,222 $ 44,261,121 $ 45,690,728 Average credit card loan receivables managed $ 48,229,519 $ 46,811,570 $ 44,277,249 $ 44,736,702 $ 45,018,288 Managed interest yield 12.65 % 12.66 % 12.53 % 11.78 % 11.91 % Managed net principal charge off rate 5.07 % 3.84 % 3.96 % 5.30 % 6.12 % Managed delinquency rate (over 30 days) 4.66 % 3.59 % 3.39 % 3.98 % 4.65 % Managed delinquency rate (over 90 days) 2.22 % 1.68 % 1.59 % 1.75 % 2.24 % 44 Table of Contents Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K particularly under Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements are to the Notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements as of November 30, 2008 and 2007 and for the three year period ended November 30, 2008. Introduction and Overview Discover Financial Services is a leading credit card issuer and electronic payment services company. We offer credit cards as well as other financial products and services to qualified customers. We are also a leader in payment processing and related services for merchants and financial institutions. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. Our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables, securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions, and fees earned from cardmembers, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provision, cardmember rewards, and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables. Our business activities are funded primarily through the process of asset securitization, the raising of consumer deposits, and both secured and unsecured debt. In a credit card securitization, loan receivables are first transferred to the securitization trust, from which beneficial interests are issued to investors. We continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans. The trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries. These trusts are excluded from our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Because our securitization activities qualify as sales under GAAP and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions, we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investor interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition. As a result, asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements in that the portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. See Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations below for information regarding proposed amendments to the accounting standards applicable to asset securitizations and see Outlook below for a discussion of the current state of the securitization markets. Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided sellers interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is not a presentation in accordance with GAAP, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income. See GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations. 45 Table of Contents 2008 Highlights The consumer credit environment continues to be challenging. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the managed charge off rate was 5.01% compared to 3.83% for the year ended November 30, 2007 and as of November 30, 2008, the managed over 30 days delinquency rate was 4.56%, up from 3.58% as of November 30, 2007. As a result, we have increased our reserve rate to 5.45% as of November 30, 2008 compared to 3.65% as of November 30, 2007. During 2008, there were significant disruptions in the capital markets. Throughout the year, issuance capacity in the credit card securitization markets became increasingly constrained and was unavailable in the fourth quarter. As a result, our on balance sheet credit card loans have grown during the period and we have recorded a reserve for loan losses on those loans. In order to finance these additional receivables, we have increased our deposit funding. Additionally, in response to the disruptions in the capital markets, we have increased our contingent liquidity reserve to $9.4 billion at November 30, 2008, up from $8.3 billion at November 30, 2007. Market interest rates were highly volatile, but generally declined during the year. As a result, we had a lower cost of funds which positively impacted pretax income as maturing deposits were replaced with new deposits issued at lower interest rates. In addition, our securitization income was favorably impacted by lower interest expense on outstanding securitizations. While the declining interest rate environment also adversely impacted interest income earned on our floating rate assets, we sought to mitigate this impact by reducing new promotional rate balance transfer activity and offering new loans at fixed rates. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 and through much of 2008, the relationship between the Federal Funds rate (which impacts the prime rate, the rate to which our floating rate credit card receivables are benchmarked) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR, the rate to which our securitization borrowings are benchmarked) widened in response to disruptions in the capital markets with LIBOR often remaining significantly higher than the Federal Funds rate. As a result, at various times in 2008, our securitization income was negatively impacted by a higher LIBOR. Also in 2008, asset backed commercial paper rates rose. In 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. In the fourth quarter 2008, we received an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement, which we recorded in other income in the U.S. Card segment. In 2009, we expect to earn the remaining amount in four quarterly payments of up to $472 million each from Visa. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. On June 30, 2008, we acquired Diners Club International (Diners Club) for $168 million. The Diners Club network has 49 network licensees that issue Diners Club cards and that maintain an acceptance network in 185 countries and territories. Results of the Diners Club business since the acquisition are reflected in our Third Party Payments segment. During the year, we had strong transaction volume in our Third Party Payments segment in comparison to 2007. Transaction volume in this segment increased 36% over the prior year to $125.1 billion, including a $12.7 billion volume contribution from Diners Club. We sold our U.K. credit card business (Goldfish) to Barclays Bank PLC on March 31, 2008. This business represented substantially all of our International Card segment, which is presented in discontinued operations in this report. 46 Table of Contents 2007 and 2006 Highlights On June 30, 2007, we spun off from Morgan Stanley through the distribution of shares of our common stock to holders of Morgan Stanley common stock (the Distribution). Our results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2007 include costs incurred as a result of the Distribution of approximately $34 million, including costs that were allocated to the International Card segment, reported as discontinued operations in this report. In 2006, market interest rates trended upward and remained stable throughout most of 2007 and the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR also remained stable during most of the period. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR changed materially, with LIBOR often remaining significantly higher than the Federal Funds rate. Leading up to October 2005, when new U.S. bankruptcy legislation became effective, we experienced a surge in bankruptcy receipts, with receipts peaking in October 2005. In 2006, we experienced a dramatic decline in bankruptcy receipts, which benefited our 2006 financial results. Bankruptcy levels rose from the 2006 level in 2007 and 2008. Outlook Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the challenging economic environment. We believe that rising unemployment levels, declining housing prices and restricted availability of credit to consumers have contributed to higher overall industry delinquency and charge off rates. We expect to continue to operate in a difficult environment in 2009. We recorded higher provision for loan losses this year as a result of higher charge offs and owned loan growth and in anticipation of higher future charge offs. We have been experiencing a trend of a greater percent of delinquent accounts flowing into later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge off. Our underwriting and portfolio management strategies and geographic diversification are designed to manage exposure to credit losses. However, the continued challenges in the consumer credit environment are likely to lead to increasingly higher charge off rates in 2009. Disruptions in the capital markets, which have caused financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail, have caused market participants to be concerned about the stability of financial markets generally, the strength of counterparties and extending credit. Due to these disruptions, we did not enter into an asset backed securitization transaction in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our last public asset backed securitization transaction was on June 18, 2008, and our last private asset backed conduit securitization transaction closed on August 28, 2008. It is difficult to predict if or when securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the introduction of the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (the TALF) in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities. It is unclear at this time what impact the TALF program will have on returning the credit card securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels. We have approximately $5.1 billion in asset backed securities maturing during 2009, of which $3.1 billion will mature in the first quarter of 2009, and $10.3 billion in asset backed securities maturing during 2010. As the downturn in execution levels in the capital markets is expected to continue, we anticipate that all of the 2009 maturities will be funded with deposits, as was done in the fourth quarter of 2008. This shift will result in higher levels of owned loan receivables with related increases in the allowance for loan losses and a reduction in the size of the interest only strip receivable. We obtain deposits through the brokered deposit market, in which third party securities brokers offer our certificates of deposit to their customers, and through the direct to consumer deposit market, in which we offer our deposit products directly to consumers. As of November 30, 2008, we had total deposits of $28.5 billion. In 47 Table of Contents 2009, we expect to increase our direct to consumer deposit business significantly. Although we believe that we can meet all of our funding needs in 2009 with deposits, competition in deposit markets may increase due to the current disruption in the capital markets. We cannot predict how an increase in competition will affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. Our priorities in 2009 include continuing to grow merchant acceptance in the United States and enhancing our global payments business. Our payments business grew its transaction volume this year, which we expect to continue throughout 2009, as this business continues to benefit from new and existing relationships with financial institutions. We will seek to accelerate our growth in third party network volume through signing additional third party issuers and through marketing programs with both our domestic third party issuers and global Diners Club network licensees. Over approximately the next two years, we expect to achieve interoperability between the Diners Club network and the Discover Network, which will allow Discover Network cardholders to use their cards at merchant and ATM locations that accept Diners Club cards around the world, and Diners Club cardholders to use their cards on the Discover Network in North America. We also expect to achieve interoperability between the Diners Club network and the PULSE Network to allow Diners Club cardholders to access cash through the PULSE Network. In 2009, we anticipate receiving significant benefits from the remaining payments from the settlement of our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard, expected to be $472 million per quarter. We expect the proceeds will strengthen our capital base during this period of economic uncertainty and intend to use a portion of the settlement proceeds to invest in growing our business. U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) was signed into law. Under EESA, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) has the authority to, among other things, invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Treasury announced its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), under which it is purchasing senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy. We are seeking to participate in the CPP for additional capital to support our consumer lending operations and other businesses. On January 14, 2009, we received preliminary approval from the U.S. Treasury to participate in the CPP, subject to standard closing conditions. We expect to issue and sell to the U.S. Treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the CPP for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S Treasury will grant final approval of our application or, if approved, what the size of any investment by the U.S Treasury ultimately will be. The senior preferred stock would qualify as Tier 1 capital and would pay a cumulative dividend rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and a rate of nine percent per annum after year five. The senior preferred stock would be non voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock. The senior preferred stock would be redeemable after three years with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Prior to the end of three years, the senior preferred stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock resulting in proceeds of not less than 25 percent of the issue price of the senior preferred stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time. Participation in the CPP would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. In conjunction with the purchase of senior preferred stock, the U.S. Treasury would receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15 percent of the senior preferred investment. The exercise price on the warrants would be the market price of our common stock, calculated on a 20 trading day trailing average. 48 Table of Contents Participation in the CPP would also require us to adopt the U.S. Treasurys standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the U.S. Treasury holds equity issued under the CPP. These standards generally apply to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, plus the three most highly compensated executive officers. In addition, we would be required to agree not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each senior executive. In addition, we expect that participation in the CPP would subject us to increased oversight by the U.S. Treasury, regulators and Congress. Under the terms of the CPP, the U.S. Treasury would have the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulator. In addition, the U.S. Treasury would have the right to appoint two directors to our board if we missed dividend payments for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, on the preferred stock. Congress has held hearings on implementation of TARP. On January 21, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation amending the TARP provisions of EESA to include quarterly reporting requirements with respect to lending activities, examinations by an institutions primary federal regulator of use of funds and compliance with program requirements, restrictions on acquisitions by depository institutions receiving TARP funds, and authorization for U.S. Treasury to have an observer at board meetings of recipient institutions, among other things. Although it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted into law, its provisions, or similar ones, may be imposed administratively by the U.S. Treasury. In addition, Congress may adopt other legislation impacting financial institutions that obtain funding under the CPP or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation. Such provisions could restrict or require changes to our lending or governance practices or increase governmental oversight of our businesses. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A. Risk Factors The impact on us of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time. In connection with participating in the CPP, we would become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Our application to become a bank holding company was approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 19, 2008. Registration as a bank holding company would subject us to new legal and regulatory requirements, including minimum capital requirements, and would subject us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulations to which we are and will become subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company. Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued proposed amendments to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended (Statement No. 140), and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). Under the proposed amendment to Statement No. 140, the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) will be eliminated. QSPEs are currently exempt from the consolidation provisions of FIN 46R, and as a result, amendments to that standard are being considered as well. Exposure drafts for proposed amendments to each standard were issued on September 15, 2008, and each was subject to a 60 day public comment period. Based on comments it received and other considerations, the FASB may revise the amendments before issuing final guidance. The changes to these standards, if adopted as proposed, may make it more difficult for us to maintain or establish sale accounting treatment in connection with transfers of financial assets in securitization transactions and could result in consolidation of the securitization entities by us. This would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. For example, the impact of the potential consolidation, if applied as of November 30, 2008, would require us to add approximately $24 billion of securitized receivables to our assets and add the related debt issued to third party investors to our 49 Table of Contents liabilities. As proposed, each amended standard would become effective for us on December 1, 2009. For a discussion of certain risks to us associated with the proposed amendments, see the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Changes to the accounting treatment of securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, reserve requirements, capital requirements, liquidity, cost of funds and operations. On September 15, 2008, the federal banking agencies issued a joint press release stating that they are evaluating the potential impact that these proposals could have on banking organizations financial statements, regulatory capital, and other regulatory requirements. In addition, a new FASB Staff Position, which requires additional disclosures for securitization activities prior to the effective date of the amendments to Statement No. 140 and FIN 46R, was issued on December 15, 2008. That guidance, FASB Staff Position FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (FSP FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8), requires inclusion of the new disclosures beginning with our report for the quarter ending February 28, 2009. Legislative and Regulatory Developments The Federal Reserve Board has adopted significant amendments to regulations that limit or modify certain credit card practices, including, but not limited to, restrictions on applying rate increases to existing and new balances, payment allocation, default pricing, notice periods and two cycle billing. The amendments become effective July 1, 2010 and will significantly impact many of our business practices. For example, we currently have the ability to increase rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and consumer behavior. The amendments will restrict our ability to manage market and credit risk in this manner. While we anticipate making changes to our pricing, credit and marketing practices that are designed to lessen the impact of these changes, there is no assurance that we will be successful. If we are not able to lessen the impact of these changes, they will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Legislation introduced in Congress in 2009 would accelerate the effective date of certain of these requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The Federal Reserve Boards amendments to certain rules will significantly impact our business practices and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. * * * The remaining discussion provides a summary of our results of operations for the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, as well as our financial condition at November 30, 2008 and 2007. All information and comparisons are based solely on continuing operations. Segments We manage our business activities in two segments: U.S. Card and Third Party Payments. In compiling the segment results that follow, the U.S. Card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Third Party Payments segment. U.S. Card. The U.S. Card segment includes Discover Card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including personal loans, student loans, prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary. Third Party Payments. The Third Party Payments segment includes the PULSE Network (PULSE), an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and our third party issuing business, which includes credit, debit and prepaid cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties. 50 Table of Contents The following table presents segment data on a managed basis and a reconciliation to a GAAP presentation (dollars in thousands): Managed Basis GAAPBasis For the Years Ended November 30, U.S. Card Third PartyPayments(1) Total SecuritizationAdjustment(2) Total 2008 Interest income $ 6,542,664 $ 3,165 $ 6,545,829 $ (3,853,266 ) $ 2,692,563 Interest expense 2,356,836 83 2,356,919 (1,068,915 ) 1,288,004 Net interest income 4,185,828 3,082 4,188,910 (2,784,351 ) 1,404,559 Provision for loan losses 3,068,604 3,068,604 (1,472,989 ) 1,595,615 Other income(3) 2,773,896 179,200 2,953,096 1,311,362 4,264,458 Other expense 2,314,926 100,871 2,415,797 2,415,797 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense $ 1,576,194 $ 81,411 $ 1,657,605 $ $ 1,657,605 2007 Interest income $ 6,376,298 $ 2,376 $ 6,378,674 $ (3,794,272 ) $ 2,584,402 Interest expense 2,741,109 19 2,741,128 (1,517,858 ) 1,223,270 Net interest income 3,635,189 2,357 3,637,546 (2,276,414 ) 1,361,132 Provision for loan losses 1,853,395 1,853,395 (1,119,508 ) 733,887 Other income 2,101,076 118,700 2,219,776 1,156,906 3,376,682 Other expense 2,394,117 84,097 2,478,214 2,478,214 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense $ 1,488,753 $ 36,960 $ 1,525,713 $ $ 1,525,713 2006 Interest income $ 5,748,698 $ 1,801 $ 5,750,499 $ (3,541,307 ) $ 2,209,192 Interest expense 2,160,569 23 2,160,592 (1,324,312 ) 836,280 Net interest income 3,588,129 1,778 3,589,907 (2,216,995 ) 1,372,912 Provision for loan losses 1,663,472 1,663,472 (1,056,707 ) 606,765 Other income 2,097,676 110,700 2,208,376 1,160,288 3,368,664 Other expense 2,383,529 83,529 2,467,058 2,467,058 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense $ 1,638,804 $ 28,949 $ 1,667,753 $ $ 1,667,753 (1) Diners Club was acquired on June 30, 2008.

The segment discussions that follow for the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are on a managed basis. U.S. Card Our U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $1.6 billion for the year ended November 30, 2008, up $87.4 million, or 6%, as compared to November 30, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven principally by payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses. Net interest income increased $550.6 million, or 15%, as higher average loan receivables and the accretion of balance transfer fees, previously recorded in loan fee income, resulted in higher interest income. Net interest income also benefited from lower interest expense driven by a lower cost of funds, which was partially offset by higher borrowings to fund higher loan receivables, higher interest charge offs and lower investment income. Provision for loan losses increased $1.2 billion, or 66%, as a result of higher net charge offs and a higher reserve rate, each of which is reflective of current economic conditions and recent delinquency trends, as well as owned loan growth due to maturing securitizations. Other income increased $672.8 million, or 32%, due to the payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and an increase in discount and interchange revenue partially offset by a write down of the interest only strip receivable and the inclusion of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008. Other expenses decreased $79.2 million, or 3%, primarily due to a $38.9 million benefit from our pension curtailment, lower account acquisition and promotional marketing activity, and a decrease in costs related to litigation. The U.S Card segment reported pretax income of $1.5 billion for the year ended November 30, 2007, down 9% as compared to November 30, 2006. The decrease in pretax income was driven by an increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net interest income. Provisions for loan losses increased $189.9 million, or 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in bankruptcy charge offs compared to the unusually low levels in 2006 as a result of new bankruptcy legislation enacted in October 2005. Net interest income increased $47.1 million, or 1%, due to higher interest income, reflecting higher average receivables, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, reflecting increased funding costs and borrowings. 52 Table of Contents The managed loan balance of $51.1 billion at November 30, 2008 was up 6% from November 30, 2007. This increase in loans is attributable to lower cardmember payments, growth in our installment loans during the year and a slight increase in credit card volume, up 2% in 2008, largely due to higher gasoline prices. This increase was partially offset by lower balance transfer activity in 2008. The weakening economic environment adversely impacted cardmember delinquencies and charge offs. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non credit card loans, was 4.56%, 98 basis points higher than last year, and the managed credit card over 30 days delinquency rate was 4.66%, up 107 basis points from last year. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were 5.01% and 5.07%, up 118 and 123 basis points from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Our loan growth combined with the deterioration in the credit environment led to a $614.7 million increase to our reserves over and above our net charge offs for the year. For the year ended November 30, 2007, managed loans grew 5%, to $48.2 billion, driven by higher sales volume of $90.3 billion, up 4% over 2006. Delinquency rates increased from the prior year reflecting weakening in the U.S. economy. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non credit card loans, was 3.58%, 19 basis points higher than 2006, and the managed credit card over 30 days delinquency rate was 3.59%, up 20 basis points from 2006. For the year ended November 30, 2007, the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were 3.83% and 3.84%, both down 12 basis points from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Third Party Payments Transaction volumes, revenues and pretax income in the Third Party Payments segment grew significantly in 2008 from 2007. Our volumes continue to benefit from new issuers and increased volume from existing issuers. This increase in volume coupled with higher fee income and the inclusion of Diners Club results for the last five months of the year drove increases in revenues and pretax income. Our Third Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $81.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2008, up $44.5 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. Revenue increased as a result of a record $125.1 billion in segment transaction volume, up 36% from last year, and higher fee revenues. Additionally, Diners Club contributed $12.7 billion of transaction volume, $27.7 million of revenues and $10.7 million of pretax income. The Third Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $ 37.0 million for the year ended November 30, 2007, up 28% as compared to November 30, 2006. The increase in pretax income was driven by higher revenue from increased volumes that was partially offset by higher marketing and pricing incentives and from higher third party card issuer fees. Third Party Payments volume was $91.7 billion for the year ended November 30, 2007, up 25% from 2006. GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our GAAP statements of financial condition. Instances in which we retain certificated beneficial interests in the securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in available for sale investment securities. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our GAAP statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. We do not establish an allowance for loan losses on our securitized loans, although a factor for uncollectibility is incorporated into the initial gain on sale of securitized loans. 53 Table of Contents The managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions; however, there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed. Specifically, these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in the transactions and cardmember payments allocated to the securitized loans, both of which are held at the trusts. These assets also include the interest only strip receivable, reflecting the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests. Income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts, changes in the fair value of the interest only strip receivable and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation. Managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitization. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts, occurring as a result of the degree to which receivables from newer accounts are added to the trusts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers and lower charge offs and delinquencies. Financial measures using managed data are non GAAP financial measures. Beginning with Earnings Summary, the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition is on a GAAP basis. The following table provides a reconciliation of the loan receivables and related statistics that are impacted by asset securitization, and which are shown on a managed basis in this annual report on Form 10 K, to the most directly comparable GAAP basis financial measure: Reconciliation of GAAP to Managed Data For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Loan Receivables Total Loans GAAP Basis $ 25,216,611 $ 20,831,117 $ 20,790,244 Securitization Adjustment 25,878,667 27,349,319 25,011,827 Managed Basis $ 51,095,278 $ 48,180,436 $ 45,802,071 Average Total Loans GAAP Basis $ 21,348,493 $ 19,947,784 $ 19,252,929 Securitization Adjustment 27,662,655 26,965,690 25,156,303 Managed Basis $ 49,011,148 $ 46,913,474 $ 44,409,232 Interest Yield GAAP Basis 10.89 % 10.73 % 10.48 % Securitization Adjustment 13.93 % 14.07 % 14.08 % Managed Basis 12.61 % 12.65 % 12.52 % Net Principal Charge off Rate GAAP Basis 4.59 % 3.40 % 3.63 % Securitization Adjustment 5.32 % 4.15 % 4.20 % Managed Basis 5.01 % 3.83 % 3.95 % 54 Table of Contents For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Delinquency Rate (over 30 days) GAAP Basis 4.35 % 3.26 % 3.05 % Securitization Adjustment 4.77 % 3.82 % 3.67 % Managed Basis 4.56 % 3.58 % 3.39 % Delinquency Rate (over 90 days) GAAP Basis 2.06 % 1.51 % 1.43 % Securitization Adjustment 2.27 % 1.79 % 1.72 % Managed Basis 2.17 % 1.67 % 1.59 % Credit Card Loans Credit Card Loans GAAP Basis $ 23,814,307 $ 20,579,923 $ 20,694,395 Securitization Adjustment 25,878,667 27,349,319 25,011,827 Managed Basis $ 49,692,974 $ 47,929,242 $ 45,706,222 Average Credit Card Loans GAAP Basis $ 20,566,864 $ 19,845,880 $ 19,120,946 Securitization Adjustment 27,662,655 26,965,690 25,156,303 Managed Basis $ 48,229,519 $ 46,811,570 $ 44,277,249 Interest Yield GAAP Basis 10.92 % 10.75 % 10.50 % Securitization Adjustment 13.93 % 14.07 % 14.08 % Managed Basis 12.65 % 12.66 % 12.53 % Net Principal Charge off Rate GAAP Basis 4.73 % 3.41 % 3.64 % Securitization Adjustment 5.32 % 4.15 % 4.20 % Managed Basis 5.07 % 3.84 % 3.96 % Delinquency Rate (over 30 days) GAAP Basis 4.55 % 3.28 % 3.05 % Securitization Adjustment 4.77 % 3.82 % 3.67 % Managed Basis 4.66 % 3.59 % 3.39 % Delinquency Rate (over 90 days) GAAP Basis 2.16 % 1.53 % 1.44 % Securitization Adjustment 2.27 % 1.79 % 1.72 % Managed Basis 2.22 % 1.68 % 1.59 % Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated and combined financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined results 55 Table of Contents of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to allowance for loan losses, asset securitization transactions, the valuation of certificated retained interests in the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT), the accrual of cardmember rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable net loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management evaluates the allowance quarterly for adequacy. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses. In estimating losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio, we use an approach that utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in loan receivables. In determining the proper level of the allowance for loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. If management used different assumptions in estimating probable losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in managements estimate of probable net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $137 million in the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2008, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. See Note 5: Loan Receivables to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about the allowance for loan losses. Accounting for Asset Securitization Transactions We account for our securitization transactions in accordance with Statement No. 140. The gain on a securitization transaction depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of the transfer. The interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive interest and certain loan fee revenues less certain costs, including loan losses on securitized loans and the contractual rate of interest paid to third party investors in the securitization as well as a servicing fee from the trust over the life of the asset sold. In the absence of observable market prices, the fair value of the interest only strip receivable is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using managements best estimate of the key assumptions, including forecasted interest yield, loan losses and payment rates, the interest paid to investors and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. Changes in the estimated fair value of the interest only strip receivable, as well as certain other retained interests, are recorded in securitization income. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results. In addition, estimates are likely to change in the future as components of the interest only strip receivable valuation are sensitive to market and economic conditions. If management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip receivable, the impact could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in the excess spread assumption for all securitized loans could have resulted in a change of approximately $28 million in the value of the interest only strip receivable as of November 30, 2008. See Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information about the accounting for securitizations. 56 Table of Contents Valuation of Certificated Retained Interests in DCENT We retain certain subordinated beneficial interests in our securitized assets, most significantly, Class B and Class C notes issued by DCENT. These certificated interests are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated statement of financial condition at their estimated fair values. Changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. The fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models, where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions. In doing these valuations, management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads that market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the currently inactive market for credit card asset backed securities. Assumed discount rates are derived from indicative pricing observed in the most recent active market for such instruments, adjusted for changes occurring thereafter in relative credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums. See Note 4: Investment Securities, Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities and Note 23: Fair Value Disclosures to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion about the accounting for our certificated retained interests in DCENT. Cardmember Rewards Cost We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we offer certain cardmembers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmembers purchases. The liability for cardmember rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition. We compute rewards liability on an individual cardmember basis and it is accumulated as qualified cardmembers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity. The liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. We estimate forfeitures based on historical account closure and charge off experience, actual cardmember purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs. We recognize reward costs for both owned loans and securitized loans as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated and combined statements of income. If management used a different estimate of forfeitures, our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations could have differed significantly. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of November 30, 2008, could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $9 million. The corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue. See Other Income and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about cardmember rewards cost. Goodwill and Other Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair values of the acquired net assets. In addition, we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the Diners Club business. As required by GAAP, we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the business unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. Because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses. Similarly, in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models. In applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. We may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. The valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. 57 Table of Contents If the assumptions used by management in these valuations are inappropriate, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when realized, could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the United States, its states and municipalities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. Changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. When such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations can be significant. See Note 18: Income Taxes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information about income taxes.

The provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge offs and a higher allowance for loan losses as a result of the weakening economic environment. Other income increased $887.8 million largely due to the $862.5 million payment by MasterCard of its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement. Other expenses decreased primarily due to the pension curtailment benefit, lower account acquisition and promotional marketing activity, and a decrease in costs related to litigation. 58 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations for the year ended November 30, 2007 was $964.2 million, down 15% compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, driven by higher provision for loan losses and higher income tax expense. The provision for loan losses increased, reflecting a trend toward higher levels of delinquencies as well as a higher level of loans retained on our balance sheet. Income tax expense increased for the year ended November 30, 2007 primarily due to favorable resolution of tax examination issues for the year ended November 30, 2006 as well as the impact of filing state combined returns exclusive of Morgan Stanley. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. Net interest margin represents interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest earning assets. Our interest earning assets consist of loan receivables, our liquidity reserve which includes Federal Funds sold and money market mutual funds, certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization, and investment securities. Interest earning assets do not include investor interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties since they are not assets which we own. Accordingly, interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans. Our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits. Net interest income is influenced by the following: The level and composition of interest earning assets and liabilities, including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and the percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices; Credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges which reduce interest income; The terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; and Effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. Net interest income increased $43.4 million, or 3%, and net interest margin decreased 62 basis points to 4.20% during the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, related to a $108.1 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $64.7 million increase in interest expense. During the year ended November 30, 2008, our net interest income improved largely because the lower cost of funds more than offset the increased levels of borrowings to support higher average interest earning assets, including a higher average liquidity reserve which generally earns a lower rate of interest than our other interest earning assets. Interest income increased due to the growth in our credit card and installment loan receivables, the inclusion of $70.1 million of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008, previously reported in loan fee income, and a higher average liquidity reserve. These increases were partially offset by higher finance charge charge offs in addition to the impact of a lower interest rate environment on our floating rate assets, specifically our liquidity reserve, amounts due from securitization and loan receivables, even though 42% of our loan receivables earned interest at floating rates for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to 52% in 2007. The increase in interest expense was largely due to our higher average funding levels in 2008, partially offset by a 61 basis point decrease to 4.66% in our cost of funds for the year ended November 30, 2008 as a result of the lower interest rate environment, and the repayment of short term borrowings due to our former parent company prior to our Distribution. 59 Table of Contents Net interest income decreased $11.8 million, or 1%, and net interest margin decreased 118 basis points to 4.82% during the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, related to a $387.0 million increase in interest expense partially offset by a $375.2 million increase in interest income. During the year ended November 30, 2007, our net interest income declined slightly because of higher average interest bearing liabilities and a higher cost of funds, which also negatively impacted our net interest margin, largely offset by higher average interest earning assets. The level of our average interest bearing liabilities, specifically deposits, during 2007 was higher than the previous year, reflecting the financing of the establishment of our liquidity reserve and growth in loan receivables. The increased levels of floating rate interest bearing liabilities coupled with the higher interest rate environment in 2007 as compared to 2006, adversely impacted interest expense. In addition, the higher interest rate environment in 2007 had a negative effect on the cost of issuing new fixed rate certificates of deposit to replace maturing certificates of deposit issued at lower, historical rates. Interest income increased due to a higher level of Federal Funds sold, which was significantly greater in comparison to the prior year as a result of the establishment of our liquidity reserve, as well as growth in average credit card loan receivables. The interest yield for the year ended November 30, 2007, was adversely impacted by a higher mix of lower yielding Federal Funds sold, offset in part by the favorable impact of a higher comparative interest rate environment on floating rate credit card loans and amounts due from asset securitization. 60 Table of Contents The following tables provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes for the years ended November 30 (dollars in thousands): Average Balance Sheet Analysis 2008 2007 2006 AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest Assets Interest earning assets: Interest earning deposits in other banks $ 5,000,415 2.47 % $ 123,445 $ 129,998 4.81 % $ 6,249 $ 1,101 3.81 % $ 42 Federal Funds sold 3,372,827 2.88 % 97,222 4,737,859 5.10 % 241,727 339,016 4.74 % 16,055 Commercial paper 1,663 4.63 % 77 15,434 5.26 % 812 13,850 5.00 % 693 Investment securities 916,307 5.60 % 51,345 199,075 5.28 % 10,502 55,476 5.46 % 3,028 Loan receivables:(1) Credit card(2) 20,566,864 10.92 % 2,245,719 19,845,880 10.75 % 2,134,188 19,120,946 10.50 % 2,007,737 Other 781,629 10.20 % 79,695 101,904 6.32 % 6,442 131,983 7.20 % 9,501 Total loan receivables 21,348,493 10.89 % 2,325,414 19,947,784 10.73 % 2,140,630 19,252,929 10.48 % 2,017,238 Other interest earning assets 2,770,260 3.43 % 95,060 3,237,581 5.70 % 184,482 3,218,436 5.35 % 172,136 Total interest earning assets 33,409,965 8.06 % 2,692,563 28,267,731 9.14 % 2,584,402 22,880,808 9.66 % 2,209,192 Allowance for loan losses (887,668 ) (658,783 ) (699,029 ) Other assets 2,960,496 2,512,889 2,282,228 Assets from discontinued operations 1,321,595 3,802,047 2,913,513 Total assets $ 36,804,388 $ 33,923,884 $ 27,377,520 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits: Time deposits(3) $ 21,208,003 5.01 % 1,062,741 $ 16,423,343 5.19 % 851,988 $ 12,585,124 4.67 % 587,244 Money market deposits 4,439,434 3.07 % 136,271 3,662,961 5.22 % 191,389 1,683,975 4.88 % 82,239 Other interest bearing deposits 40,337 1.05 % 424 36,748 3.26 % 1,197 25,613 3.29 % 843 Total interest bearing deposits 25,687,774 4.67 % 1,199,436 20,123,052 5.19 % 1,044,574 14,294,712 4.69 % 670,326 Borrowings: Short term borrowings 37,660 0.91 % 343 1,629,810 5.48 % 89,319 2,334,648 5.03 % 117,462 Long term borrowings 1,919,147 4.60 % 88,225 1,459,114 6.13 % 89,377 820,045 5.91 % 48,492 Total borrowings 1,956,807 4.53 % 88,568 3,088,924 5.79 % 178,696 3,154,693 5.26 % 165,954 Total interest bearing liabilities 27,644,581 4.66 % 1,288,004 23,211,976 5.27 % 1,223,270 17,449,405 4.79 % 836,280 Other liabilities and stockholders equity Liabilities of discontinued operations 968,406 2,806,564 2,429,459 Other liabilities and stockholders equity 8,191,401 7,905,344 7,498,656 Total other liabilities and stockholders equity 9,159,807 10,711,908 9,928,115 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 36,804,388 $ 33,923,884 $ 27,377,520 Net interest income $ 1,404,559 $ 1,361,132 $ 1,372,912 Net interest margin(4) 4.20 % 4.82 % 6.00 % Interest rate spread(5) 3.40 % 3.87 % 4.87 % (1) Average balances of loan receivables include non accruing loans and these loans are therefore included in the yield calculations.

Loan Quality Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance, the seasoning of our loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. We also consider the credit quality of the loan portfolio in determining the allowance for loan losses. Credit quality at any time reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts, the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, and the seasoning of the loans. See Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion of our policies and Net Charge offs and Delinquencies and Non Performing Loans below for further discussion of credit quality. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $861.7 million, or 117%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge offs. In the year ended November 30, 2008, we added $614.7 million to the allowance for loan losses to bring the total allowance to $1.4 billion, an increase of 81% over November 30, 2007. This 62 Table of Contents increase in the allowance reflects an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to rising delinquency and charge off rates and loan growth, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as we retained more loan receivables from maturing securitizations on our balance sheet in response to the inability to re securitize the receivables as a result of the disruption in the securitization markets. For the year ended November 30, 2007, the provision for loan losses increased $127.1 million, or 21%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, reflecting a higher loan portfolio and an increase in delinquencies in the fourth quarter of 2007. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses rose to $759.9 million at November 30, 2007, an increase of $56.0 million, or 8%, as compared to November 30, 2006. Allowance for Loan Losses The following table provides a summary of the composition of the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Balance at beginning of year $ 759,925 $ 703,917 $ 795,722 $ 910,261 $ 963,093 Additions: Provision for loan losses 1,595,615 733,887 606,765 816,197 893,531 Deductions: Charge offs (1,147,240 ) (839,092 ) (852,636 ) (1,076,179 ) (1,061,084 ) Recoveries 166,285 161,213 154,066 145,642 114,721 Net charge offs (980,955 ) (677,879 ) (698,570 ) (930,537 ) (946,363 ) Translation adjustments and other (199 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,374,585 $ 759,925 $ 703,917 $ 795,722 $ 910,261 Net Charge offs Our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day contractual time frame. The net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period. The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Net charge offs $ 980,955 4.59 % $ 677,879 3.40 % $ 698,570 3.63 % $ 930,537 4.93 % $ 946,363 5.71 % The net charge off rate on our loan receivables increased 119 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2008 compared to November 30, 2007. The higher net charge off rate was due to higher delinquencies beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the weakening economic environment as a result of rising unemployment, declining housing prices and the decrease in the availability of consumer credit, as well as an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs. 63 Table of Contents The net charge off rate on loan receivables declined 23 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. This decline reflected a continued lower level of bankruptcy related charge offs following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation, offset in part by a higher level of contractual charge offs. The bankruptcy legislation, which made it more difficult for individuals to declare bankruptcy, resulted in a surge in bankruptcy receipts and related charge offs in 2005 and early 2006. Accordingly, the year ended November 30, 2006 was adversely impacted by an elevated level of charge offs in the first quarter. Delinquencies and Non Performing Loans Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. Loan receivables are placed on non accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember, as part of certain collection management processes, and other instances in which management feels collectibility is not assured. The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days past due, loan receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands): At November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Loans over 30 days delinquent $ 1,096,627 4.35 % $ 679,306 3.26 % $ 633,150 3.05 % $ 756,198 3.67 % $ 790,512 4.18 % Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest $ 444,324 1.76 % $ 271,227 1.30 % $ 244,675 1.17 % $ 263,439 1.26 % $ 342,324 1.64 % Loans not accruing interest $ 173,123 0.69 % $ 102,286 0.49 % $ 110,625 0.53 % $ 215,671 1.05 % $ 116,596 0.62 % The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 109 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively, at November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. This increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our cardmembers ability to pay their loan balances. Delinquency rates normally rise as charge offs rise, however, in 2008, we experienced a pattern of charge offs rising faster than delinquencies due to greater percentage of delinquent accounts flowing into the later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge off and due to an increase in consumer bankruptcy filings. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2008 increased 20 basis points to 0.69%, as compared to November 30, 2007, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications. The delinquency rate of our loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 21 basis points and 13 basis points, respectively, at November 30, 2007, as compared to November 30, 2006, as a result of a weakening U.S. economy. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2007 decreased 4 basis points to 0.49%, as compared to November 30, 2006, as a result of lower bankruptcies. Maturities and Sensitivities of Loan Receivables to Changes in Interest Rates Our loan receivables had the following maturity distribution(1) at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Due OneYear orLess Due AfterOne YearThroughFive Years Due AfterFive Years Total Credit card $ 5,770,208 $ 12,071,108 $ 5,972,991 $ 23,814,307 Other 1,012 483,185 918,107 1,402,304 Loan receivables $ 5,771,220 $ 12,554,293 $ 6,891,098 $ 25,216,611 (1) Because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, which historically have been higher than contractually required minimum payments, this amount may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments. 64 Table of Contents At November 30, 2008, of our loan receivables due after one year, approximately $8.3 billion had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $11.1 billion were fixed rate loans.

Total other income increased $887.8 million, or 26%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, primarily as a result of an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and higher securitization income, partially offset by a decline in loan fee income as balance transfer fees were reported in interest income beginning in the third quarter 2008. Total other income was relatively flat for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, as higher securitization income and other income were largely offset by lower discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. Within other income, this change to allocating discount and interchange revenue has the effect of decreasing discount and interchange revenue and increasing securitization income. The amount of discount and interchange revenue allocated to securitization transactions has increased since this change was made in 2004 and is expected to continue increasing as new transactions which include such allocations are completed and or securitizations transactions that did not receive allocations mature. For the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were 84%, 67% and 53%, respectively, of average securitized loans to which discount and interchange revenue was allocated. To broaden merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards, we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late 2006. In addition, we have sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and reduce costs. As the outsourcing continues, merchant discount has been replaced by acquirer interchange and assessments, which reduces the percentage of income per transaction and, over time, operating expenses as we no longer incur costs to acquire and service small and mid sized merchants. The lower cost per transaction is generally expected to be offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance. Gains on the sale of merchant acquiring portfolios are reflected in other income as earned. 65 Table of Contents Securitization Income Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through the securitization and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card receivables we originated. The issuance of asset backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition. Also, portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our residual interests in those transactions. Investors in securitizations are allocated the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue earned on securitized loans. In addition, for securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. These cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows remaining are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests. Securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans. For the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the average securitized loans were $27.7 billion, $27.0 billion and $25.2 billion, respectively. The table below presents the components of securitization income (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Excess spread $ 2,017,146 $ 1,753,844 $ 1,619,225 $ 263,302 15 % $ 134,619 8 % Servicing fees on securitized loans 553,398 538,409 506,417 14,989 3 % 31,992 6 % Net revaluation of retained interests(1) (119,324 ) 51,346 156,621 (170,670 ) (332 %) (105,275 ) (67 %) Other (principally transaction costs) (22,062 ) (19,976 ) (17,396 ) (2,086 ) (10 %) (2,580 ) (15 %) Total securitization income $ 2,429,158 $ 2,323,623 $ 2,264,867 $ 105,535 5 % $ 58,756 3 % (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable. For the year ended November 30, 2008, securitization income increased $105.5 million, or 5%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007 primarily reflecting higher excess spread on securitized loans offset in part by a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests, which are detailed further in the tables and discussion below. For the year ended November 30, 2007, securitization income increased $58.8 million, or 3%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The increase reflects higher excess spread and servicing fees related to a higher level of average securitized loans, offset in part by a lower net revaluation of retained interests. 66 Table of Contents Excess spread. The following table provides the components of excess spread (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Interest income on securitized loans $ 3,853,266 $ 3,794,272 $ 3,541,307 $ 58,994 2 % $ 252,965 7 % Interest paid to investors in asset backed securities (1,068,915 ) (1,517,858 ) (1,324,312 ) 448,943 30 % (193,546 ) (15 %) Net interest income 2,784,351 2,276,414 2,216,995 507,937 22 % 59,419 3 % Other fee revenue on securitized loans(1) 1,259,182 1,135,347 965,354 123,835 11 % 169,993 18 % Net charge offs on securitized loans (1,472,989 ) (1,119,508 ) (1,056,707 ) (353,481 ) (32 %) (62,801 ) (6 %) Net revenues on securitized loans 2,570,544 2,292,253 2,125,642 278,291 12 % 166,611 8 % Servicing fees on securitized loans (553,398 ) (538,409 ) (506,417 ) (14,989 ) (3 %) (31,992 ) (6 %) Excess spread $ 2,017,146 $ 1,753,844 $ 1,619,225 $ 263,302 15 % $ 134,619 8 % (1) Other fee income includes discount and interchange revenue, loan fee income and fee products revenue. For the year ended November 30, 2008, excess spread on securitized loans increased $263.3 million, or 15%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. The increase was attributable to higher net interest income and higher other fee revenue on securitized loans offset in part by higher net charge offs. The increase in net interest income related largely to a decrease in interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average LIBOR on floating rate investor interests, offset in part by higher premiums paid to investors on new transactions. Higher other fee revenue was attributable to the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. The higher net charge offs were reflective of the weakening economic and credit environment. For the year ended November 30, 2007, excess spread on securitized loans increased $134.6 million, or 8%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due primarily to a higher level of average securitized loans and other fee revenue on securitized loans resulting from the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. Although net interest income increased as a result of the higher level of average securitized loans, the net interest spread for the year ended November 30, 2007 was lower due to a higher rate of return paid on floating rate investor interest due to higher average LIBOR. Servicing fees on securitized loans. We are paid a servicing fee from the cash flows generated by the securitized loans. Servicing fees are paid to the Company for servicing the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements. These cash flows include interest income and loan fee income as well as discount and interchange revenue for certain securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2008, servicing fees increased $15.0 million, or 3%, from the prior year due to a higher level of securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2007, servicing fees increased $32.0 million, or 6%, from the prior year due to a higher level of securitized loans. 67 Table of Contents Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ $ Initial gain on new securitization transactions(1) $ 71,872 $ 122,949 $ 96,724 $ (51,077 ) $ 26,225 Revaluation of retained interests (191,196 ) (71,603 ) 59,897 (119,593 ) (131,500 ) Net revaluation of retained interests $ (119,324 ) $ 51,346 $ 156,621 $ (170,670 ) $ (105,275 ) (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2008 decreased $170.7 million, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. The decrease included $51.1 million lower initial gains on a lower level of securitization activity ($5.6 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to $8.5 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2007) and lower projected excess spread on new securitizations as a result of higher charge offs. The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests of $191.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2008 largely related to unfavorable changes in assumptions used to value the interest only strip receivable as compared to the previous period end, including lower projected excess spread. The lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge offs, higher interest rate projections and widening spreads on new securitizations as a result of the current trends in the securitization markets. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2007 decreased $105.3 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The unfavorable net revaluation of retained interests of $71.6 million for the year ended November 30, 2007 was primarily attributable to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions. This was offset in part by higher projected excess spread at November 30, 2007, reflecting the lower absolute interest rate environment as compared to that assumed at the prior year end. The year ended November 30, 2007 also reflected a higher initial gain as a result of a higher level of new securitization transactions as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. Loan Fee Income Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, cash advance and other miscellaneous fees. Loan fee income decreased $75.5 million, or 22%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007, respectively, as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees beginning in the second quarter of 2008 historically accounted for in loan fee income. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, balance transfer fees are accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Loan fee income increased $12.3 million, or 4%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, reflecting higher balance transfer fees partially offset by lower late and overlimit fees. Discount and Interchange Revenue Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions and acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by cardholders at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually 68 Table of Contents established and is based on the card issuing organizations transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmembers purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which results in a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and an increase in securitization income. However, cardmember rewards costs associated with the securitized loans are not allocated to investor interests, and as such, do not impact securitization income. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $53.4 million, or 22% for the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to November 30, 2007, due to higher allocations to securitized loans, partially offset by lower cardholder rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized loans receiving such allocations in the current year than in 2007. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $110.8 million, or 31%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due to higher allocations to securitized loans and higher cardmember rewards, partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue earned related to increased sales volume. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized loans receiving allocations than in 2006 while the increase in cardmember rewards reflected higher sales volume. Fee Products We earn revenue related to fees received for marketing credit related ancillary products including debt deferment/debt cancellation contracts and identity theft protection services to cardmembers. The amount of revenue recorded is based on the terms of the agreements and contracts with third party providers. We recognize this income over the agreement or contract period as earned. Fee products income increased $35.2 million, or 16%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, primarily related to debt deferment/debt cancellation and identity theft protection revenues as a result of increased marketing of these products. Fee products income increased $22.5 million, or 12%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily related to higher debt deferment/debt cancellation revenue. Merchant Fees Merchant fees consist primarily of fees charged to merchants for various services including manual authorization of transactions and delivery of hardcopy statements. For the year ended November 30, 2008, merchant fees decreased $25.5 million, or 28%, as compared to November 30, 2007 and merchant fees decreased $16.7 million, or 15%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The decrease in both periods is due to increased outsourcing to merchant acquirers. As merchant acquiring portfolios are sold to third party merchant acquirers, this revenue will decrease along with associated costs. Transaction Processing Revenue Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing ATM, debit and point of sale transactions over the PULSE Network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. Transaction processing revenue increased $16.3 million, or 16%, for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to November 30, 2007, primarily due to increased volumes of transactions processed on the network partially offset by pricing incentives. Transaction processing revenue increased $5.2 million, or 5%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by pricing incentives. 69 Table of Contents Loss on Investment Securities Loss on investment securities includes realized gains and losses on the sale of investments as well as any write downs of investment securities to fair value when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary. In both 2008 and 2007, we concluded there had been an other than temporary impairment in our investment in the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC, which invested in mortgage backed securities, resulting in a $49.1 million and $11.4 million write down of the notes in the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to monitor the value of the investment. Future valuations may result in further impairment of the investment. In comparison, there were no material losses on investment securities for the year ended November 30, 2006. Antitrust Litigation Settlement Amounts received in conjunction with the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, including related interest, are recorded in this line item when earned. In 2008, we received an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Other Income Other income includes revenues from the sale of merchant portfolios to third party acquirers, royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income increased $60.4 million in 2008, primarily due to the inclusion of Diners Club revenue and reporting an unrealized gain on interest rate swap agreements for the year ended November 30, 2008 compared to an unrealized loss for the year ended November 30, 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower gains from sales of merchant portfolios. Other income increased $48.2 million, or 159%, for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to November 30, 2006 related to gains from sales of merchant portfolios and revenue from the referral of declined applications. This increase was partially offset by losses recorded in recognizing our interest rate swap agreements not designated as fair value swaps at their fair value. Other Expense The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 845,392 $ 850,065 $ 864,565 $ (4,673 ) (1 %) $ (14,500 ) (2 %) Marketing and business development 530,901 576,263 561,751 (45,362 ) (8 %) 14,512 3 % Information processing and communications 315,943 330,053 331,159 (14,110 ) (4 %) (1,106 ) 0 % Professional fees 349,484 361,409 339,784 (11,925 ) (3 %) 21,625 6 % Premises and equipment 80,394 79,442 80,325 952 1 % (883 ) (1 %) Other expense 293,683 280,982 289,474 12,701 5 % (8,492 ) (3 %) Total other expense $ 2,415,797 $ 2,478,214 $ 2,467,058 $ (62,417 ) (3 %) $ 11,156 0 % 70 Table of Contents Total other expense decreased $62.4 million, or 3% for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by lower marketing expenditures, lower information processing and communications and lower professional fees, partially offset by the inclusion of Diners Club expenses. Marketing fees decreased $45.4 million, or 8% in the same period due to lower direct marketing activity partially offset by increased internet and television advertising. Information processing and communications fees declined due to lower depreciation expense as certain assets became fully depreciated in 2008. Professional fees decreased $11.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to lower legal fees relating to lower general, regulatory and routine advisory legal fees partially offset by an increase in legal fees associated with collection fees. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased due to a pension credit as a result of the announcement of the freezing of benefit accruals under the pension plans in 2008 partially offset by higher compensation costs. Total other expense was relatively flat for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to November 30, 2006 as higher professional fees and marketing expenses were largely offset by lower employee compensation and benefits and other expense. Professional fees increased $21.6 million, or 6%, primarily due to spin off related costs partially offset by lower overhead allocations from Morgan Stanley. Marketing and business development increased $14.5 million, or 3%, due to increased acquisition spending partially offset by reduced advertising. Employee compensation and benefits decreased $14.5 million, or 2%, primarily related to a decrease in overhead allocations from Morgan Stanley and lower benefit and commission costs partially offset by higher salaries and higher amortization related to Founders Grant awards. Other expense decreased $8.5 million, or 3%, related to lower licenses and fees expenses. Income Tax Expense For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2008 2007 2006 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits 2.5 2.2 1.8 Federal examinations and settlements (2.3 ) State examinations and settlements (0.9 ) (0.1 ) (1.3 ) Non deductible spin off costs 0.2 Other (0.7 ) (0.5 ) (1.1 ) Effective income tax rate 35.9 % 36.8 % 32.1 % Income tax expense increased $33.2 million, or 6%, for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting an increase in pretax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased 1% for the year ended November 30, 2008 from 36.8% for the year ended November 30, 2007 as a result of the settlement of certain state examination issues, which resulted in a tax benefit during 2008. Income tax expense increased $26.0 million, or 5%, in the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The year ended November 30, 2006 benefited from a favorable resolution of tax examination issues addressed during the course of a federal tax audit for the years 1997 through 1998 and the favorable settlement of state tax matters. The year ended November 30, 2007, includes the impact of filing state combined returns exclusive of Morgan Stanley. Liquidity and Capital Resources We maintain liquidity, capital and funding strategies designed to optimize our credit ratings and provide that our bank capitalization levels are sufficient to allow for cost effective access to debt and deposit markets, thus providing sufficient liquidity to fund our business over both the short and long term. Our liquidity and funding risk management strategies are designed to mitigate the risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to fund our business and service our financial obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk is addressed 71 Table of Contents through various funding criteria and targets that guide our access to the long term and short term debt capital markets and various deposit distribution channels, the maturity profile of our liabilities, the diversity of our funding sources and investor base, as well as the level of our liquidity reserve. Liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including our maturity profile, which measures funding in various maturity tranches. The maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are appropriately staggered. The mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to assess whether there is appropriate diversification. Our primary funding sources include deposits (sourced directly or through brokers), term asset backed securitizations, asset backed commercial paper conduit financing and short term borrowings. We monitor and review liquidity and capital management strategies seeking to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and capital. Our senior management reviews financial performance relative to these strategies, monitors the availability of alternative financing sources, evaluates liquidity risk and capital adequacy, and assesses the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. Certain of our borrowing costs and the ability to raise funds in specific ratings sensitive markets are directly impacted by our credit ratings. Discover Bank and Discover Financial Services have maintained investment grade ratings. Discover Bank has a BBB rating from Standard & Poors, a Baa2 deposit and Baa2 senior unsecured rating from Moodys Investors Service and a BBB rating from Fitch Ratings. Discover Financial Services has a BBB long term rating from Standard & Poors, a Baa3 senior unsecured rating from Moodys Investors Service and a BBB long term rating from Fitch Ratings. Moodys Investors Service recently changed its outlook for the credit ratings of Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank from Stable to Negative. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We maintain a process designed to evaluate our liquidity position and our vulnerabilities to disruptions in our funding markets. This process results in contingency funding plans that model a range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to: (i) repayment of all debt maturing within an assumed stress period; (ii) expected funding requirements from receivable maintenance, growth and or volatility; and (iii) customer cash withdrawals from interest bearing deposits. These stress scenarios are designed to evaluate both short term liquidity stress as well as a prolonged liquidity stress event. In a liquidity stress event, we would seek to increase deposits, liquidate investments and use contingent funding sources to fund our loan receivables and meet our other liquidity needs. At November 30, 2008, our contingent funding sources included approximately $9.4 billion in our liquidity reserve (primarily invested in Federal Funds sold and triple A rated money market mutual funds), $1.5 billion of unutilized commitments from third party commercial paper asset backed conduits for securitization funding, and $2.4 billion of unsecured committed credit. In addition, we had $5.2 billion of available capacity through the Federal Reserve discount window, which includes access to $2.4 billion through the Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility. In addition, management may seek to reduce business funding requirements by implementing asset reduction strategies. Notwithstanding the challenging conditions in the financial markets during the past year, we have satisfied all maturing obligations and funded our business operations by utilizing the multiple funding sources more fully described below. We expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations during the next 12 months through access to our multiple funding sources, with primary reliance on deposits. In the event that existing access to deposit channels becomes disrupted and or access to the capital markets continues to be disrupted during the next 12 months, we believe that we would be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations during that time by utilizing our multiple sources of contingent funding more fully described below, including our liquidity reserve, asset backed commercial paper conduit capacity, committed credit facility capacity and Federal Reserve discount window capacity. 72 Table of Contents Equity Capital Management. Management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. We determine the level of capital necessary to support our business based on our managed loan receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, taking into account, among other things, regulatory requirements, rating agency guidelines and internally managed requirements to sustain growth. Equity increased to $5.9 billion in November 30, 2008 from $5.6 billion in November 30, 2007. The level of capital throughout 2009 is expected to be positively impacted by the Visa and Master Card antitrust litigation settlement more fully described below, which will contribute to capital in 2009. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC insured financial institutions must maintain minimum levels of capital that are dependent upon the risk of the financial institutions assets, specifically (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (leverage ratio), (b) 4% to 6% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio) and (c) 8% to 10% of total capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (total risk weighted capital ratio). At November 30, 2008, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio and total risk weighted capital ratio of Discover Bank as well as those of our other FDIC insured financial institution, Bank of New Castle, exceeded these regulatory minimums. U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) was signed into law. Under EESA, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) has the authority to, among other things, invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Treasury announced its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), under which it is purchasing senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy. We are seeking to participate in the CPP for additional capital to support our consumer lending operations and other businesses. On January 14, 2009, we received preliminary approval from the U.S. Treasury to participate in the CPP, subject to standard closing conditions. We expect to issue and sell to the U.S. Treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the CPP for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S Treasury will grant final approval of our application or, if approved, what the size of any investment by the U.S Treasury ultimately will be. In connection with participating in the CPP, we would become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Our application to become a bank holding company was approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 19, 2008. The senior preferred stock would qualify as Tier 1 capital and would pay a cumulative dividend rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and a rate of nine percent per annum after year five. The senior preferred stock would be non voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock. The senior preferred stock would be redeemable after three years with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Prior to the end of three years, the senior preferred stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock resulting in proceeds of not less than 25 percent of the issue price of the senior preferred stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time. Participation in the CPP would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. In conjunction with the purchase of senior preferred stock, the U.S. Treasury would receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15 percent of the senior preferred investment. The exercise price on the warrants would be the market price of our common stock, calculated on a 20 trading day trailing average. For more information, see U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. 73 Table of Contents Dividend Policy. Although we intend to reinvest a substantial portion of our earnings in our business, we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, as a result of applicable banking regulations and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be further limited. If we participate in the CPP, we will be prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock for a period of three years unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, dividend payments on our common stock will be prohibited unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock. Share Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock under a new share repurchase program. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. At November 30, 2008, we had not repurchased any stock under this program. If we participate in the CPP, we will be prohibited from repurchasing our common stock for a period of three years, except in connection with the administration of an employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock issued under the CPP is outstanding, we may not repurchase any of our shares of common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock. Settlement of Visa and MasterCard Antitrust Litigation. On October 27, 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. In the fourth quarter 2008, we received an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement, which we recorded in other income in the U.S. Card segment. In 2009, we expect to earn the remaining amount in four quarterly payments of up to $472 million each from Visa. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Impact of Proposed Revisions to FASB Statement No. 140 and FASB Interpretation 46R. The trusts used in our securitizations currently are not consolidated on our financial statements for reporting purposes because the trusts are qualifying special purpose entities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (Statement No. 140). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued proposed amendments to Statement No. 140 and FASB Interpretation No. 46R. As currently drafted, these amendments will require us to consolidate our securitization trusts on our balance sheet, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, including our capital requirements. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Changes to the accounting treatment of securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, reserve requirements, capital requirements, liquidity, cost of funds and operations. Securities Available for Sale. As of November 30, 2008, Discover Bank held $1.1 billion in available for sale investment securities. This amount includes $981.7 million of certificated retained interests in DCENT. Our available for sale investment securities also include $85.8 million of investments made in highly rated third party credit card asset backed securities. As of November 30, 2008, the weighted average life of all of our available for sale investment securities was approximately 2 years. 74 Table of Contents Funding Sources Securitization Financing. Historically, we have used the securitization of credit card receivables as our largest single source of funding, including both the public securitization market and the privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduit financing market. Due to recent market events and continued disruption in the capital markets, the securitization markets have not been available at volumes and pricing levels that would be attractive to us. Our last public securitization transaction closed on June 18, 2008, and our last private asset backed commercial paper conduit transaction closed on August 28, 2008. It is difficult to predict if or when the securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels, but we currently do not expect to be able to access these markets during 2009. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the introduction of the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (the TALF) in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities generally. It is unclear at this time what impact the TALF program will have on returning the securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels. Our response to the tightened securitization markets has been, and will continue to be, utilization of deposits. For more information, see the Outlook section at the beginning of this Item 7 and Deposits below. We use non consolidated securitization trusts to securitize our credit card loan receivables. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are accounted for as sold and, accordingly, are removed from the consolidated statements of financial condition. We have historically securitized between approximately 50% and 60% of our managed credit card loan receivables. Outstanding public and private asset backed commercial paper conduit financing at November 30, 2008 were $20.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2008, we had $1.5 billion in unused asset backed commercial paper conduit capacity. The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of the investors interests in securitizations at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year(1) One YearThroughThree Years(2) Four YearsThroughFive Years AfterFive Years Scheduled maturities of the investors interest in securitizations $ 25,559,744 $ 4,989,475 $ 14,875,530 $ 3,705,265 $ 1,989,474 (1) In the first quarter of 2009, we have total contractual maturities of investors interest of $3.1 billion. (2) In 2010, we have total contractual maturities of investors interest of $10.3 billion. We access the public asset securitization market through the Discover Card Master Trust I and, beginning July 26, 2007, DCENT, using receivables generated by our U.S. Card business. Through the Discover Card Master Trust I, we have used a structure utilizing Class A, triple A rated certificates and Class B, single A rated certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates and a cash collateral account. DCENT includes three classes of securities sold to investors, the most senior class generally receiving a triple A rating. In this structure, in order to issue senior, higher rated classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower rated classes of notes. As of November 30, 2008, we had triple A rated note issuance capacity of $5.0 billion in DCENT, subject to market availability. In order to maintain this level of triple A rated note issuance capacity, we have purchased $1.1 billion principal amount of subordinated notes issued by DCENT, which are classified as available for sale investment securities for accounting purposes. In the future, we may purchase additional subordinated notes to maintain our triple A rated note issuance capacity. As of November 30, 2008, cash collateral accounts providing credit enhancement for the securitization transactions of Discover Card Master Trust I had a balance of $1.3 billion. Discover Financial Services financed 75 Table of Contents $1.2 billion of cash collateral accounts (reflected in amounts due from asset securitizations in the consolidated statements of financial condition at its fair value, which was $1.1 billion at November 30, 2008). The rights to repayment of a portion of the cash collateral account loans have been sold to a special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, as part of a $0.7 billion secured financing and are not expected to be available to creditors of Discover Financial Services. The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of the cash collateral accounts at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years AfterFive Years Scheduled maturities of cash collateral accounts $ 1,163,685 $ 321,316 $ 655,263 $ 127,895 $ 59,211 The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the underlying securities, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as economic early amortization. In the event of an economic early amortization (which would occur if the excess spread (the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged off receivables) falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three month rolling average), the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our consolidated statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities. As of November 30, 2008, no economic early amortization events have occurred. The table below provides information concerning investor interest and related excess spreads at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Investor Interest # of SeriesOutstanding 3 Month RollingAverage ExcessSpread Interchange series(1) $ 14,905,269 17 7.31 % Non interchange series 2,789,475 3 4.14 % Discover Card Master Trust I 17,694,744 20 4.14 % Discover Card Execution Note Trust(1) 7,865,000 20 6.49 % Total Company $ 25,559,744 40 (1) Discover Card Master Trust I certificates issued on or after November 4, 2004 and all notes issued by DCENT include cash flows derived from discount and interchange revenue earned by Discover Bank. Deposits. We utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short term credit sensitive funding sources, thus enhancing our liquidity position. Our response to the disruptions in the securitization market has been, and we anticipate will continue to be, increased utilization of deposits. We obtain our deposits through two channels: (1) agency arrangements with securities brokerage firms, which place deposits with their customers; and, increasingly, (2) products offered directly to consumers through direct mail, internet origination and affinity relationships, including certificates of deposit and money market accounts. We currently utilize six of the largest securities brokerage firms to obtain deposit funding through distribution of our certificates of deposit to their customers. Four of these six brokerage firms have external selling group capability, which allows them to distribute deposits through other brokerage firms (which can exceed a group of 200 brokers). We have elected to use the selling group capabilities of these brokerage firms to extend deposit gathering capabilities for cost effectiveness. 76 Table of Contents Our certificates of deposit have maturities ranging from one month to fifteen years, and had a weighted average maturity of 28 months at November 30, 2008, which is up from 22 months at November 30, 2007 as a result of issuances of deposits with longer maturities. Total interest bearing deposits at November 30, 2008 were $28.5 billion, the remaining maturities of which are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): Total ThreeMonths orLess Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths Over TwelveMonths Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000(1) $ 22,083,962 $ 2,359,276 $ 2,162,925 $ 2,294,831 $ 15,266,930 Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000(1) or greater 1,808,320 216,453 210,886 415,712 965,269 Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts 4,559,864 4,559,864 Total interest bearing deposits $ 28,452,146 $ 7,135,593 $ 2,373,811 $ 2,710,543 $ 16,232,199 (1) Represents the basic insurance amount covered by the FDIC. Effective October 23, 2008, the United States Congress temporarily increased FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000 through December 31, 2009. Short Term Borrowings. Short term borrowings consist of borrowings through the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility, term, overnight Federal Funds purchased and other short term borrowings with original maturities of less than one year. On November 6, 2008, Discover Bank borrowed $500 million through the Term Auction Facility at an interest rate of 60 bps for a period of 84 days. This allowed Discover Bank to obtain funding at a lower interest rate than alternatives existing at that time. The following table identifies the balances and weighted average interest rates on short term borrowings outstanding at and for the years ended (dollars in thousands): November 30, 2008 November 30, 2007 November 30, 2006 MaximumMonth End BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate MaximumMonth End BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate MaximumMonthEnd BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate Overnight Federal Funds purchased $ 250,000 $ $ 3,430,000 $ 250,000 4.68 % $ 3,000,000 $ 3,000,000 5.31 % Term Federal Funds purchased $ 500,000 500,000 0.60 % $ 540,000 $ 1,769,000 100,000 5.35 % Other short term borrowings $ $ 2,106,124 $ 4,655,321 1,811,124 5.46 % Total short term borrowings $ 500,000 0.60 % $ 250,000 $ 4,911,124 Long Term Debt and Bank Notes. At November 30, 2008, we had $400 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes outstanding which mature in June 2010 and $400 million principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding which mature in June 2017. Additionally, we had $250 million principal amount of bank notes outstanding at November 30, 2008 which mature in February 2009. In October 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the TLGP) pursuant to which the FDIC will guarantee the timely payment of interest and principal on certain newly issued senior unsecured debt of eligible entities issued on or before June 30, 2009. Discover Bank has opted into the TLGP and is eligible to receive the benefit of the TLGP guarantee in connection with the issuance of senior unsecured debt of up to $312.5 million. While it is unclear at this time whether Discover Bank will be issuing unsecured debt pursuant to the TLGP, our participation in this program may provide us access to an additional source of funding. 77 Table of Contents Available Credit Facilities Secured Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources. In connection with our asset securitization program, we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At November 30, 2008, these conduits totaled $6.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion was unused. The original commitments of these facilities range from 364 day renewable agreements to multi year extendable commitments. Unsecured Committed Credit Facilities. As of November 30, 2008, our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.4 billion had a remaining life of 42 months. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility became effective at the time of the Distribution, is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank (Discover Financial Services may borrow up to 30% and Discover Bank may borrow up to 100% of the total commitment). We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time. At November 30, 2008, we had no outstanding balances due under the facility. Federal Reserve. Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias discount window and has participated in the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility. In December 2007, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a temporary Term Auction Facility. All depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program are eligible to participate in Term Auction Facility auctions. Discover Bank had $5.2 billion of available capacity through the Federal discount window as of November 30, 2008, which was reduced to $4.7 billion after we borrowed an additional $500 million through the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility in December 2008. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements See Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Sources Securitization Financing. Guarantees Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed on the Discover Network, transactions processed by Diners Club licensees and indemnifications made in conjunction with the sale of the Goldfish business. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement. See Note 21: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 78 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2008 include deposits, long term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2008 are summarized below (dollars in thousands): Payments Due By Period Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years More ThanFive Years Deposits(1) $ 28,530,521 $ 12,298,322 $ 8,657,292 $ 5,932,728 $ 1,642,179 Bank notes(2) 250,000 250,000 Secured borrowings(3) 682,456 154,210 528,246 Unsecured borrowings(4) 800,000 400,000 400,000 Capital lease obligations(5) 3,646 1,391 2,255 Operating leases(5) 37,766 5,872 10,155 7,572 14,167 Interest payments on fixed rate debt 232,200 25,800 51,600 51,600 103,200 Purchase obligations(6) 403,706 208,680 121,264 34,770 38,992 Total contractual obligations $ 30,940,295 $ 12,944,275 $ 9,770,812 $ 6,026,670 $ 2,198,538 (1) See Note 10: Deposits to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our deposits. The certificates of deposit accrue interest at fixed rates. All other interest bearing deposits accrue interest at variable rates. (2) See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $1.3 million as of November 30, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 2.54% at November 30, 2008. (3) Interest charges on secured borrowings, of which the full repayment is dependent upon the available balances of the cash collateral accounts at the maturities of the underlying securitization transactions, are based on a fifty basis point spread over monthly commercial paper issuance costs. See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $32.3 million as of November 30, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 3.05% at November 30, 2008. (4) See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate note is estimated to be $20.8 million as of November 30, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 3.35% at November 30, 2008. Total future payment of interest charges for the fixed rate note is equal to the amount reported in the table above under Interest payments on fixed rate debt. The fixed rate note is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition net of discounts. (5) See Note 21: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our capital and operating lease obligations. (6) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license and telecommunications agreements. Purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2008 reflect the minimum collateral obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition. As of November 30, 2008 the Companys consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefit of $285.6 million, and approximately $29.6 million of accrued interest and penalties. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated income tax obligations associated with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) have been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 18: Income Taxes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our FIN 48 obligations. At November 30, 2008, we extended credit for consumer and commercial loans of approximately $207 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated and combined financial statements. 79 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally managed loan receivables. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, deposits, and short term and long term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree. Our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables, Federal Funds sold, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest earning deposits and certain investment securities. Portions of our credit card loan receivables have fixed interest rates, although we currently have the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate unless the account has been closed or the cardmember opts out of repricing actions. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2008, we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities (reported on a managed basis) over the following 12 month period would be reduced by approximately $38 million. We estimate the comparable reduction of pretax income for the 12 month period following November 30, 2007 to be approximately $108 million. A predominate portion of this change can be attributed to changes we made to our market risk model. We have moved from a static view of future balances towards a more dynamic approach that portrays our business forecast. The change is also due to having fewer interest rate sensitive liabilities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. As of November 30, 2008, we believe our foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial. 80 Table of Contents 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K particularly under Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements are to the Notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements as of November 30, 2008 and 2007 and for the three year period ended November 30, 2008. Introduction and Overview Discover Financial Services is a leading credit card issuer and electronic payment services company. We offer credit cards as well as other financial products and services to qualified customers. We are also a leader in payment processing and related services for merchants and financial institutions. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. Our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables, securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions, and fees earned from cardmembers, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provision, cardmember rewards, and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables. Our business activities are funded primarily through the process of asset securitization, the raising of consumer deposits, and both secured and unsecured debt. In a credit card securitization, loan receivables are first transferred to the securitization trust, from which beneficial interests are issued to investors. We continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans. The trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries. These trusts are excluded from our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Because our securitization activities qualify as sales under GAAP and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions, we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investor interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition. As a result, asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements in that the portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. See Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations below for information regarding proposed amendments to the accounting standards applicable to asset securitizations and see Outlook below for a discussion of the current state of the securitization markets. Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided sellers interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is not a presentation in accordance with GAAP, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income. See GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations. 45 Table of Contents 2008 Highlights The consumer credit environment continues to be challenging. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the managed charge off rate was 5.01% compared to 3.83% for the year ended November 30, 2007 and as of November 30, 2008, the managed over 30 days delinquency rate was 4.56%, up from 3.58% as of November 30, 2007. As a result, we have increased our reserve rate to 5.45% as of November 30, 2008 compared to 3.65% as of November 30, 2007. During 2008, there were significant disruptions in the capital markets. Throughout the year, issuance capacity in the credit card securitization markets became increasingly constrained and was unavailable in the fourth quarter. As a result, our on balance sheet credit card loans have grown during the period and we have recorded a reserve for loan losses on those loans. In order to finance these additional receivables, we have increased our deposit funding. Additionally, in response to the disruptions in the capital markets, we have increased our contingent liquidity reserve to $9.4 billion at November 30, 2008, up from $8.3 billion at November 30, 2007. Market interest rates were highly volatile, but generally declined during the year. As a result, we had a lower cost of funds which positively impacted pretax income as maturing deposits were replaced with new deposits issued at lower interest rates. In addition, our securitization income was favorably impacted by lower interest expense on outstanding securitizations. While the declining interest rate environment also adversely impacted interest income earned on our floating rate assets, we sought to mitigate this impact by reducing new promotional rate balance transfer activity and offering new loans at fixed rates. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 and through much of 2008, the relationship between the Federal Funds rate (which impacts the prime rate, the rate to which our floating rate credit card receivables are benchmarked) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR, the rate to which our securitization borrowings are benchmarked) widened in response to disruptions in the capital markets with LIBOR often remaining significantly higher than the Federal Funds rate. As a result, at various times in 2008, our securitization income was negatively impacted by a higher LIBOR. Also in 2008, asset backed commercial paper rates rose. In 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. In the fourth quarter 2008, we received an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement, which we recorded in other income in the U.S. Card segment. In 2009, we expect to earn the remaining amount in four quarterly payments of up to $472 million each from Visa. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. On June 30, 2008, we acquired Diners Club International (Diners Club) for $168 million. The Diners Club network has 49 network licensees that issue Diners Club cards and that maintain an acceptance network in 185 countries and territories. Results of the Diners Club business since the acquisition are reflected in our Third Party Payments segment. During the year, we had strong transaction volume in our Third Party Payments segment in comparison to 2007. Transaction volume in this segment increased 36% over the prior year to $125.1 billion, including a $12.7 billion volume contribution from Diners Club. We sold our U.K. credit card business (Goldfish) to Barclays Bank PLC on March 31, 2008. This business represented substantially all of our International Card segment, which is presented in discontinued operations in this report. 46 Table of Contents 2007 and 2006 Highlights On June 30, 2007, we spun off from Morgan Stanley through the distribution of shares of our common stock to holders of Morgan Stanley common stock (the Distribution). Our results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2007 include costs incurred as a result of the Distribution of approximately $34 million, including costs that were allocated to the International Card segment, reported as discontinued operations in this report. In 2006, market interest rates trended upward and remained stable throughout most of 2007 and the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR also remained stable during most of the period. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the relationship between the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR changed materially, with LIBOR often remaining significantly higher than the Federal Funds rate. Leading up to October 2005, when new U.S. bankruptcy legislation became effective, we experienced a surge in bankruptcy receipts, with receipts peaking in October 2005. In 2006, we experienced a dramatic decline in bankruptcy receipts, which benefited our 2006 financial results. Bankruptcy levels rose from the 2006 level in 2007 and 2008. Outlook Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the challenging economic environment. We believe that rising unemployment levels, declining housing prices and restricted availability of credit to consumers have contributed to higher overall industry delinquency and charge off rates. We expect to continue to operate in a difficult environment in 2009. We recorded higher provision for loan losses this year as a result of higher charge offs and owned loan growth and in anticipation of higher future charge offs. We have been experiencing a trend of a greater percent of delinquent accounts flowing into later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge off. Our underwriting and portfolio management strategies and geographic diversification are designed to manage exposure to credit losses. However, the continued challenges in the consumer credit environment are likely to lead to increasingly higher charge off rates in 2009. Disruptions in the capital markets, which have caused financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail, have caused market participants to be concerned about the stability of financial markets generally, the strength of counterparties and extending credit. Due to these disruptions, we did not enter into an asset backed securitization transaction in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our last public asset backed securitization transaction was on June 18, 2008, and our last private asset backed conduit securitization transaction closed on August 28, 2008. It is difficult to predict if or when securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the introduction of the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (the TALF) in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities. It is unclear at this time what impact the TALF program will have on returning the credit card securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels. We have approximately $5.1 billion in asset backed securities maturing during 2009, of which $3.1 billion will mature in the first quarter of 2009, and $10.3 billion in asset backed securities maturing during 2010. As the downturn in execution levels in the capital markets is expected to continue, we anticipate that all of the 2009 maturities will be funded with deposits, as was done in the fourth quarter of 2008. This shift will result in higher levels of owned loan receivables with related increases in the allowance for loan losses and a reduction in the size of the interest only strip receivable. We obtain deposits through the brokered deposit market, in which third party securities brokers offer our certificates of deposit to their customers, and through the direct to consumer deposit market, in which we offer our deposit products directly to consumers. As of November 30, 2008, we had total deposits of $28.5 billion. In 47 Table of Contents 2009, we expect to increase our direct to consumer deposit business significantly. Although we believe that we can meet all of our funding needs in 2009 with deposits, competition in deposit markets may increase due to the current disruption in the capital markets. We cannot predict how an increase in competition will affect deposit renewal rates, costs or availability. Our priorities in 2009 include continuing to grow merchant acceptance in the United States and enhancing our global payments business. Our payments business grew its transaction volume this year, which we expect to continue throughout 2009, as this business continues to benefit from new and existing relationships with financial institutions. We will seek to accelerate our growth in third party network volume through signing additional third party issuers and through marketing programs with both our domestic third party issuers and global Diners Club network licensees. Over approximately the next two years, we expect to achieve interoperability between the Diners Club network and the Discover Network, which will allow Discover Network cardholders to use their cards at merchant and ATM locations that accept Diners Club cards around the world, and Diners Club cardholders to use their cards on the Discover Network in North America. We also expect to achieve interoperability between the Diners Club network and the PULSE Network to allow Diners Club cardholders to access cash through the PULSE Network. In 2009, we anticipate receiving significant benefits from the remaining payments from the settlement of our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard, expected to be $472 million per quarter. We expect the proceeds will strengthen our capital base during this period of economic uncertainty and intend to use a portion of the settlement proceeds to invest in growing our business. U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) was signed into law. Under EESA, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) has the authority to, among other things, invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Treasury announced its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), under which it is purchasing senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy. We are seeking to participate in the CPP for additional capital to support our consumer lending operations and other businesses. On January 14, 2009, we received preliminary approval from the U.S. Treasury to participate in the CPP, subject to standard closing conditions. We expect to issue and sell to the U.S. Treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the CPP for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S Treasury will grant final approval of our application or, if approved, what the size of any investment by the U.S Treasury ultimately will be. The senior preferred stock would qualify as Tier 1 capital and would pay a cumulative dividend rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and a rate of nine percent per annum after year five. The senior preferred stock would be non voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock. The senior preferred stock would be redeemable after three years with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Prior to the end of three years, the senior preferred stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock resulting in proceeds of not less than 25 percent of the issue price of the senior preferred stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time. Participation in the CPP would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. In conjunction with the purchase of senior preferred stock, the U.S. Treasury would receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15 percent of the senior preferred investment. The exercise price on the warrants would be the market price of our common stock, calculated on a 20 trading day trailing average. 48 Table of Contents Participation in the CPP would also require us to adopt the U.S. Treasurys standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the U.S. Treasury holds equity issued under the CPP. These standards generally apply to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, plus the three most highly compensated executive officers. In addition, we would be required to agree not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of $500,000 for each senior executive. In addition, we expect that participation in the CPP would subject us to increased oversight by the U.S. Treasury, regulators and Congress. Under the terms of the CPP, the U.S. Treasury would have the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulator. In addition, the U.S. Treasury would have the right to appoint two directors to our board if we missed dividend payments for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, on the preferred stock. Congress has held hearings on implementation of TARP. On January 21, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation amending the TARP provisions of EESA to include quarterly reporting requirements with respect to lending activities, examinations by an institutions primary federal regulator of use of funds and compliance with program requirements, restrictions on acquisitions by depository institutions receiving TARP funds, and authorization for U.S. Treasury to have an observer at board meetings of recipient institutions, among other things. Although it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted into law, its provisions, or similar ones, may be imposed administratively by the U.S. Treasury. In addition, Congress may adopt other legislation impacting financial institutions that obtain funding under the CPP or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation. Such provisions could restrict or require changes to our lending or governance practices or increase governmental oversight of our businesses. See Item 1. Business Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A. Risk Factors The impact on us of recently enacted legislation and government programs to stabilize the financial markets cannot be predicted at this time. In connection with participating in the CPP, we would become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Our application to become a bank holding company was approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 19, 2008. Registration as a bank holding company would subject us to new legal and regulatory requirements, including minimum capital requirements, and would subject us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. See Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new regulations to which we are and will become subject as a result of becoming a bank holding company. Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued proposed amendments to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended (Statement No. 140), and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46R). Under the proposed amendment to Statement No. 140, the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE) will be eliminated. QSPEs are currently exempt from the consolidation provisions of FIN 46R, and as a result, amendments to that standard are being considered as well. Exposure drafts for proposed amendments to each standard were issued on September 15, 2008, and each was subject to a 60 day public comment period. Based on comments it received and other considerations, the FASB may revise the amendments before issuing final guidance. The changes to these standards, if adopted as proposed, may make it more difficult for us to maintain or establish sale accounting treatment in connection with transfers of financial assets in securitization transactions and could result in consolidation of the securitization entities by us. This would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. For example, the impact of the potential consolidation, if applied as of November 30, 2008, would require us to add approximately $24 billion of securitized receivables to our assets and add the related debt issued to third party investors to our 49 Table of Contents liabilities. As proposed, each amended standard would become effective for us on December 1, 2009. For a discussion of certain risks to us associated with the proposed amendments, see the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors Changes to the accounting treatment of securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, reserve requirements, capital requirements, liquidity, cost of funds and operations. On September 15, 2008, the federal banking agencies issued a joint press release stating that they are evaluating the potential impact that these proposals could have on banking organizations financial statements, regulatory capital, and other regulatory requirements. In addition, a new FASB Staff Position, which requires additional disclosures for securitization activities prior to the effective date of the amendments to Statement No. 140 and FIN 46R, was issued on December 15, 2008. That guidance, FASB Staff Position FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (FSP FAS 140 4 and FIN 46(R) 8), requires inclusion of the new disclosures beginning with our report for the quarter ending February 28, 2009. Legislative and Regulatory Developments The Federal Reserve Board has adopted significant amendments to regulations that limit or modify certain credit card practices, including, but not limited to, restrictions on applying rate increases to existing and new balances, payment allocation, default pricing, notice periods and two cycle billing. The amendments become effective July 1, 2010 and will significantly impact many of our business practices. For example, we currently have the ability to increase rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and consumer behavior. The amendments will restrict our ability to manage market and credit risk in this manner. While we anticipate making changes to our pricing, credit and marketing practices that are designed to lessen the impact of these changes, there is no assurance that we will be successful. If we are not able to lessen the impact of these changes, they will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Legislation introduced in Congress in 2009 would accelerate the effective date of certain of these requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors The Federal Reserve Boards amendments to certain rules will significantly impact our business practices and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. * * * The remaining discussion provides a summary of our results of operations for the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, as well as our financial condition at November 30, 2008 and 2007. All information and comparisons are based solely on continuing operations. Segments We manage our business activities in two segments: U.S. Card and Third Party Payments. In compiling the segment results that follow, the U.S. Card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Third Party Payments segment. U.S. Card. The U.S. Card segment includes Discover Card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including personal loans, student loans, prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary. Third Party Payments. The Third Party Payments segment includes the PULSE Network (PULSE), an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and our third party issuing business, which includes credit, debit and prepaid cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties. 50 Table of Contents The following table presents segment data on a managed basis and a reconciliation to a GAAP presentation (dollars in thousands): Managed Basis GAAPBasis For the Years Ended November 30, U.S. Card Third PartyPayments(1) Total SecuritizationAdjustment(2) Total 2008 Interest income $ 6,542,664 $ 3,165 $ 6,545,829 $ (3,853,266 ) $ 2,692,563 Interest expense 2,356,836 83 2,356,919 (1,068,915 ) 1,288,004 Net interest income 4,185,828 3,082 4,188,910 (2,784,351 ) 1,404,559 Provision for loan losses 3,068,604 3,068,604 (1,472,989 ) 1,595,615 Other income(3) 2,773,896 179,200 2,953,096 1,311,362 4,264,458 Other expense 2,314,926 100,871 2,415,797 2,415,797 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense $ 1,576,194 $ 81,411 $ 1,657,605 $ $ 1,657,605 2007 Interest income $ 6,376,298 $ 2,376 $ 6,378,674 $ (3,794,272 ) $ 2,584,402 Interest expense 2,741,109 19 2,741,128 (1,517,858 ) 1,223,270 Net interest income 3,635,189 2,357 3,637,546 (2,276,414 ) 1,361,132 Provision for loan losses 1,853,395 1,853,395 (1,119,508 ) 733,887 Other income 2,101,076 118,700 2,219,776 1,156,906 3,376,682 Other expense 2,394,117 84,097 2,478,214 2,478,214 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense $ 1,488,753 $ 36,960 $ 1,525,713 $ $ 1,525,713 2006 Interest income $ 5,748,698 $ 1,801 $ 5,750,499 $ (3,541,307 ) $ 2,209,192 Interest expense 2,160,569 23 2,160,592 (1,324,312 ) 836,280 Net interest income 3,588,129 1,778 3,589,907 (2,216,995 ) 1,372,912 Provision for loan losses 1,663,472 1,663,472 (1,056,707 ) 606,765 Other income 2,097,676 110,700 2,208,376 1,160,288 3,368,664 Other expense 2,383,529 83,529 2,467,058 2,467,058 Income from continuing operations before income tax expense $ 1,638,804 $ 28,949 $ 1,667,753 $ $ 1,667,753 (1) Diners Club was acquired on June 30, 2008.

The segment discussions that follow for the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are on a managed basis. U.S. Card Our U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $1.6 billion for the year ended November 30, 2008, up $87.4 million, or 6%, as compared to November 30, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven principally by payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses. Net interest income increased $550.6 million, or 15%, as higher average loan receivables and the accretion of balance transfer fees, previously recorded in loan fee income, resulted in higher interest income. Net interest income also benefited from lower interest expense driven by a lower cost of funds, which was partially offset by higher borrowings to fund higher loan receivables, higher interest charge offs and lower investment income. Provision for loan losses increased $1.2 billion, or 66%, as a result of higher net charge offs and a higher reserve rate, each of which is reflective of current economic conditions and recent delinquency trends, as well as owned loan growth due to maturing securitizations. Other income increased $672.8 million, or 32%, due to the payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and an increase in discount and interchange revenue partially offset by a write down of the interest only strip receivable and the inclusion of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008. Other expenses decreased $79.2 million, or 3%, primarily due to a $38.9 million benefit from our pension curtailment, lower account acquisition and promotional marketing activity, and a decrease in costs related to litigation. The U.S Card segment reported pretax income of $1.5 billion for the year ended November 30, 2007, down 9% as compared to November 30, 2006. The decrease in pretax income was driven by an increase in provision for loan losses partially offset by higher net interest income. Provisions for loan losses increased $189.9 million, or 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in bankruptcy charge offs compared to the unusually low levels in 2006 as a result of new bankruptcy legislation enacted in October 2005. Net interest income increased $47.1 million, or 1%, due to higher interest income, reflecting higher average receivables, partially offset by an increase in interest expense, reflecting increased funding costs and borrowings. 52 Table of Contents The managed loan balance of $51.1 billion at November 30, 2008 was up 6% from November 30, 2007. This increase in loans is attributable to lower cardmember payments, growth in our installment loans during the year and a slight increase in credit card volume, up 2% in 2008, largely due to higher gasoline prices. This increase was partially offset by lower balance transfer activity in 2008. The weakening economic environment adversely impacted cardmember delinquencies and charge offs. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non credit card loans, was 4.56%, 98 basis points higher than last year, and the managed credit card over 30 days delinquency rate was 4.66%, up 107 basis points from last year. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were 5.01% and 5.07%, up 118 and 123 basis points from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Our loan growth combined with the deterioration in the credit environment led to a $614.7 million increase to our reserves over and above our net charge offs for the year. For the year ended November 30, 2007, managed loans grew 5%, to $48.2 billion, driven by higher sales volume of $90.3 billion, up 4% over 2006. Delinquency rates increased from the prior year reflecting weakening in the U.S. economy. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non credit card loans, was 3.58%, 19 basis points higher than 2006, and the managed credit card over 30 days delinquency rate was 3.59%, up 20 basis points from 2006. For the year ended November 30, 2007, the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were 3.83% and 3.84%, both down 12 basis points from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Third Party Payments Transaction volumes, revenues and pretax income in the Third Party Payments segment grew significantly in 2008 from 2007. Our volumes continue to benefit from new issuers and increased volume from existing issuers. This increase in volume coupled with higher fee income and the inclusion of Diners Club results for the last five months of the year drove increases in revenues and pretax income. Our Third Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $81.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2008, up $44.5 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. Revenue increased as a result of a record $125.1 billion in segment transaction volume, up 36% from last year, and higher fee revenues. Additionally, Diners Club contributed $12.7 billion of transaction volume, $27.7 million of revenues and $10.7 million of pretax income. The Third Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $ 37.0 million for the year ended November 30, 2007, up 28% as compared to November 30, 2006. The increase in pretax income was driven by higher revenue from increased volumes that was partially offset by higher marketing and pricing incentives and from higher third party card issuer fees. Third Party Payments volume was $91.7 billion for the year ended November 30, 2007, up 25% from 2006. GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our GAAP statements of financial condition. Instances in which we retain certificated beneficial interests in the securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in available for sale investment securities. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our GAAP statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. We do not establish an allowance for loan losses on our securitized loans, although a factor for uncollectibility is incorporated into the initial gain on sale of securitized loans. 53 Table of Contents The managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions; however, there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed. Specifically, these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in the transactions and cardmember payments allocated to the securitized loans, both of which are held at the trusts. These assets also include the interest only strip receivable, reflecting the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests. Income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts, changes in the fair value of the interest only strip receivable and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation. Managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitization. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts, occurring as a result of the degree to which receivables from newer accounts are added to the trusts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers and lower charge offs and delinquencies. Financial measures using managed data are non GAAP financial measures. Beginning with Earnings Summary, the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition is on a GAAP basis. The following table provides a reconciliation of the loan receivables and related statistics that are impacted by asset securitization, and which are shown on a managed basis in this annual report on Form 10 K, to the most directly comparable GAAP basis financial measure: Reconciliation of GAAP to Managed Data For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Loan Receivables Total Loans GAAP Basis $ 25,216,611 $ 20,831,117 $ 20,790,244 Securitization Adjustment 25,878,667 27,349,319 25,011,827 Managed Basis $ 51,095,278 $ 48,180,436 $ 45,802,071 Average Total Loans GAAP Basis $ 21,348,493 $ 19,947,784 $ 19,252,929 Securitization Adjustment 27,662,655 26,965,690 25,156,303 Managed Basis $ 49,011,148 $ 46,913,474 $ 44,409,232 Interest Yield GAAP Basis 10.89 % 10.73 % 10.48 % Securitization Adjustment 13.93 % 14.07 % 14.08 % Managed Basis 12.61 % 12.65 % 12.52 % Net Principal Charge off Rate GAAP Basis 4.59 % 3.40 % 3.63 % Securitization Adjustment 5.32 % 4.15 % 4.20 % Managed Basis 5.01 % 3.83 % 3.95 % 54 Table of Contents For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Delinquency Rate (over 30 days) GAAP Basis 4.35 % 3.26 % 3.05 % Securitization Adjustment 4.77 % 3.82 % 3.67 % Managed Basis 4.56 % 3.58 % 3.39 % Delinquency Rate (over 90 days) GAAP Basis 2.06 % 1.51 % 1.43 % Securitization Adjustment 2.27 % 1.79 % 1.72 % Managed Basis 2.17 % 1.67 % 1.59 % Credit Card Loans Credit Card Loans GAAP Basis $ 23,814,307 $ 20,579,923 $ 20,694,395 Securitization Adjustment 25,878,667 27,349,319 25,011,827 Managed Basis $ 49,692,974 $ 47,929,242 $ 45,706,222 Average Credit Card Loans GAAP Basis $ 20,566,864 $ 19,845,880 $ 19,120,946 Securitization Adjustment 27,662,655 26,965,690 25,156,303 Managed Basis $ 48,229,519 $ 46,811,570 $ 44,277,249 Interest Yield GAAP Basis 10.92 % 10.75 % 10.50 % Securitization Adjustment 13.93 % 14.07 % 14.08 % Managed Basis 12.65 % 12.66 % 12.53 % Net Principal Charge off Rate GAAP Basis 4.73 % 3.41 % 3.64 % Securitization Adjustment 5.32 % 4.15 % 4.20 % Managed Basis 5.07 % 3.84 % 3.96 % Delinquency Rate (over 30 days) GAAP Basis 4.55 % 3.28 % 3.05 % Securitization Adjustment 4.77 % 3.82 % 3.67 % Managed Basis 4.66 % 3.59 % 3.39 % Delinquency Rate (over 90 days) GAAP Basis 2.16 % 1.53 % 1.44 % Securitization Adjustment 2.27 % 1.79 % 1.72 % Managed Basis 2.22 % 1.68 % 1.59 % Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated and combined financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated and combined results 55 Table of Contents of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to allowance for loan losses, asset securitization transactions, the valuation of certificated retained interests in the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT), the accrual of cardmember rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable net loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management evaluates the allowance quarterly for adequacy. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses. In estimating losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio, we use an approach that utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in loan receivables. In determining the proper level of the allowance for loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. If management used different assumptions in estimating probable losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in managements estimate of probable net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $137 million in the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2008, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. See Note 5: Loan Receivables to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about the allowance for loan losses. Accounting for Asset Securitization Transactions We account for our securitization transactions in accordance with Statement No. 140. The gain on a securitization transaction depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of the transfer. The interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive interest and certain loan fee revenues less certain costs, including loan losses on securitized loans and the contractual rate of interest paid to third party investors in the securitization as well as a servicing fee from the trust over the life of the asset sold. In the absence of observable market prices, the fair value of the interest only strip receivable is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using managements best estimate of the key assumptions, including forecasted interest yield, loan losses and payment rates, the interest paid to investors and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. Changes in the estimated fair value of the interest only strip receivable, as well as certain other retained interests, are recorded in securitization income. The use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different financial results. In addition, estimates are likely to change in the future as components of the interest only strip receivable valuation are sensitive to market and economic conditions. If management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip receivable, the impact could have a material effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in the excess spread assumption for all securitized loans could have resulted in a change of approximately $28 million in the value of the interest only strip receivable as of November 30, 2008. See Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information about the accounting for securitizations. 56 Table of Contents Valuation of Certificated Retained Interests in DCENT We retain certain subordinated beneficial interests in our securitized assets, most significantly, Class B and Class C notes issued by DCENT. These certificated interests are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated statement of financial condition at their estimated fair values. Changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. The fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models, where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions. In doing these valuations, management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads that market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the currently inactive market for credit card asset backed securities. Assumed discount rates are derived from indicative pricing observed in the most recent active market for such instruments, adjusted for changes occurring thereafter in relative credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums. See Note 4: Investment Securities, Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities and Note 23: Fair Value Disclosures to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion about the accounting for our certificated retained interests in DCENT. Cardmember Rewards Cost We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we offer certain cardmembers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmembers purchases. The liability for cardmember rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition. We compute rewards liability on an individual cardmember basis and it is accumulated as qualified cardmembers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity. The liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. We estimate forfeitures based on historical account closure and charge off experience, actual cardmember purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs. We recognize reward costs for both owned loans and securitized loans as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated and combined statements of income. If management used a different estimate of forfeitures, our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations could have differed significantly. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of November 30, 2008, could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $9 million. The corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue. See Other Income and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further details about cardmember rewards cost. Goodwill and Other Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair values of the acquired net assets. In addition, we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the Diners Club business. As required by GAAP, we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the business unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. Because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses. Similarly, in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models. In applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. We may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. The valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. 57 Table of Contents If the assumptions used by management in these valuations are inappropriate, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when realized, could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the United States, its states and municipalities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. Changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. When such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated and combined financial condition and results of operations can be significant. See Note 18: Income Taxes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information about income taxes. Earnings Summary The following table outlines changes in our consolidated and combined statement of income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase (decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Interest income $ 2,692,563 $ 2,584,402 $ 2,209,192 $ 108,161 4 % $ 375,210 17 % Interest expense 1,288,004 1,223,270 836,280 64,734 5 % 386,990 46 % Net interest income 1,404,559 1,361,132 1,372,912 43,427 3 % (11,780 ) (1 %) Provision for loan losses 1,595,615 733,887 606,765 861,728 117 % 127,122 21 % Net interest income after provision for loan losses (191,056 ) 627,245 766,147 (818,301 ) (130 %) (138,902 ) (18 %) Other income 4,264,458 3,376,682 3,368,664 887,776 26 % 8,018 0 % Other expense 2,415,797 2,478,214 2,467,058 (62,417 ) (3 %) 11,156 0 % Income from continuing operations before income tax expense 1,657,605 1,525,713 1,667,753 131,892 9 % (142,040 ) (9 %) Income tax expense 594,692 561,514 535,563 33,178 6 % 25,951 5 % Income from continuing operations $ 1,062,913 $ 964,199 $ 1,132,190 $ 98,714 10 % $ (167,991 ) (15 %) Income from continuing operations for the year ended November 30, 2008 was $1.1 billion, up 10% compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, driven by higher other income, higher net interest income and lower other expense, partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge offs and a higher allowance for loan losses as a result of the weakening economic environment. Other income increased $887.8 million largely due to the $862.5 million payment by MasterCard of its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement. Other expenses decreased primarily due to the pension curtailment benefit, lower account acquisition and promotional marketing activity, and a decrease in costs related to litigation. 58 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations for the year ended November 30, 2007 was $964.2 million, down 15% compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, driven by higher provision for loan losses and higher income tax expense. The provision for loan losses increased, reflecting a trend toward higher levels of delinquencies as well as a higher level of loans retained on our balance sheet. Income tax expense increased for the year ended November 30, 2007 primarily due to favorable resolution of tax examination issues for the year ended November 30, 2006 as well as the impact of filing state combined returns exclusive of Morgan Stanley. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. Net interest margin represents interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest earning assets. Our interest earning assets consist of loan receivables, our liquidity reserve which includes Federal Funds sold and money market mutual funds, certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization, and investment securities. Interest earning assets do not include investor interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties since they are not assets which we own. Accordingly, interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans. Our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits. Net interest income is influenced by the following: The level and composition of interest earning assets and liabilities, including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and the percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices; Credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges which reduce interest income; The terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; and Effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. Net interest income increased $43.4 million, or 3%, and net interest margin decreased 62 basis points to 4.20% during the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, related to a $108.1 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $64.7 million increase in interest expense. During the year ended November 30, 2008, our net interest income improved largely because the lower cost of funds more than offset the increased levels of borrowings to support higher average interest earning assets, including a higher average liquidity reserve which generally earns a lower rate of interest than our other interest earning assets. Interest income increased due to the growth in our credit card and installment loan receivables, the inclusion of $70.1 million of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008, previously reported in loan fee income, and a higher average liquidity reserve. These increases were partially offset by higher finance charge charge offs in addition to the impact of a lower interest rate environment on our floating rate assets, specifically our liquidity reserve, amounts due from securitization and loan receivables, even though 42% of our loan receivables earned interest at floating rates for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to 52% in 2007. The increase in interest expense was largely due to our higher average funding levels in 2008, partially offset by a 61 basis point decrease to 4.66% in our cost of funds for the year ended November 30, 2008 as a result of the lower interest rate environment, and the repayment of short term borrowings due to our former parent company prior to our Distribution. 59 Table of Contents Net interest income decreased $11.8 million, or 1%, and net interest margin decreased 118 basis points to 4.82% during the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, related to a $387.0 million increase in interest expense partially offset by a $375.2 million increase in interest income. During the year ended November 30, 2007, our net interest income declined slightly because of higher average interest bearing liabilities and a higher cost of funds, which also negatively impacted our net interest margin, largely offset by higher average interest earning assets. The level of our average interest bearing liabilities, specifically deposits, during 2007 was higher than the previous year, reflecting the financing of the establishment of our liquidity reserve and growth in loan receivables. The increased levels of floating rate interest bearing liabilities coupled with the higher interest rate environment in 2007 as compared to 2006, adversely impacted interest expense. In addition, the higher interest rate environment in 2007 had a negative effect on the cost of issuing new fixed rate certificates of deposit to replace maturing certificates of deposit issued at lower, historical rates. Interest income increased due to a higher level of Federal Funds sold, which was significantly greater in comparison to the prior year as a result of the establishment of our liquidity reserve, as well as growth in average credit card loan receivables. The interest yield for the year ended November 30, 2007, was adversely impacted by a higher mix of lower yielding Federal Funds sold, offset in part by the favorable impact of a higher comparative interest rate environment on floating rate credit card loans and amounts due from asset securitization. 60 Table of Contents The following tables provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes for the years ended November 30 (dollars in thousands): Average Balance Sheet Analysis 2008 2007 2006 AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest Assets Interest earning assets: Interest earning deposits in other banks $ 5,000,415 2.47 % $ 123,445 $ 129,998 4.81 % $ 6,249 $ 1,101 3.81 % $ 42 Federal Funds sold 3,372,827 2.88 % 97,222 4,737,859 5.10 % 241,727 339,016 4.74 % 16,055 Commercial paper 1,663 4.63 % 77 15,434 5.26 % 812 13,850 5.00 % 693 Investment securities 916,307 5.60 % 51,345 199,075 5.28 % 10,502 55,476 5.46 % 3,028 Loan receivables:(1) Credit card(2) 20,566,864 10.92 % 2,245,719 19,845,880 10.75 % 2,134,188 19,120,946 10.50 % 2,007,737 Other 781,629 10.20 % 79,695 101,904 6.32 % 6,442 131,983 7.20 % 9,501 Total loan receivables 21,348,493 10.89 % 2,325,414 19,947,784 10.73 % 2,140,630 19,252,929 10.48 % 2,017,238 Other interest earning assets 2,770,260 3.43 % 95,060 3,237,581 5.70 % 184,482 3,218,436 5.35 % 172,136 Total interest earning assets 33,409,965 8.06 % 2,692,563 28,267,731 9.14 % 2,584,402 22,880,808 9.66 % 2,209,192 Allowance for loan losses (887,668 ) (658,783 ) (699,029 ) Other assets 2,960,496 2,512,889 2,282,228 Assets from discontinued operations 1,321,595 3,802,047 2,913,513 Total assets $ 36,804,388 $ 33,923,884 $ 27,377,520 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits: Time deposits(3) $ 21,208,003 5.01 % 1,062,741 $ 16,423,343 5.19 % 851,988 $ 12,585,124 4.67 % 587,244 Money market deposits 4,439,434 3.07 % 136,271 3,662,961 5.22 % 191,389 1,683,975 4.88 % 82,239 Other interest bearing deposits 40,337 1.05 % 424 36,748 3.26 % 1,197 25,613 3.29 % 843 Total interest bearing deposits 25,687,774 4.67 % 1,199,436 20,123,052 5.19 % 1,044,574 14,294,712 4.69 % 670,326 Borrowings: Short term borrowings 37,660 0.91 % 343 1,629,810 5.48 % 89,319 2,334,648 5.03 % 117,462 Long term borrowings 1,919,147 4.60 % 88,225 1,459,114 6.13 % 89,377 820,045 5.91 % 48,492 Total borrowings 1,956,807 4.53 % 88,568 3,088,924 5.79 % 178,696 3,154,693 5.26 % 165,954 Total interest bearing liabilities 27,644,581 4.66 % 1,288,004 23,211,976 5.27 % 1,223,270 17,449,405 4.79 % 836,280 Other liabilities and stockholders equity Liabilities of discontinued operations 968,406 2,806,564 2,429,459 Other liabilities and stockholders equity 8,191,401 7,905,344 7,498,656 Total other liabilities and stockholders equity 9,159,807 10,711,908 9,928,115 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 36,804,388 $ 33,923,884 $ 27,377,520 Net interest income $ 1,404,559 $ 1,361,132 $ 1,372,912 Net interest margin(4) 4.20 % 4.82 % 6.00 % Interest rate spread(5) 3.40 % 3.87 % 4.87 % (1) Average balances of loan receivables include non accruing loans and these loans are therefore included in the yield calculations.

Loan Quality Provision for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance, the seasoning of our loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. We also consider the credit quality of the loan portfolio in determining the allowance for loan losses. Credit quality at any time reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts, the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, and the seasoning of the loans. See Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion of our policies and Net Charge offs and Delinquencies and Non Performing Loans below for further discussion of credit quality. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $861.7 million, or 117%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge offs. In the year ended November 30, 2008, we added $614.7 million to the allowance for loan losses to bring the total allowance to $1.4 billion, an increase of 81% over November 30, 2007. This 62 Table of Contents increase in the allowance reflects an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to rising delinquency and charge off rates and loan growth, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as we retained more loan receivables from maturing securitizations on our balance sheet in response to the inability to re securitize the receivables as a result of the disruption in the securitization markets. For the year ended November 30, 2007, the provision for loan losses increased $127.1 million, or 21%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, reflecting a higher loan portfolio and an increase in delinquencies in the fourth quarter of 2007. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses rose to $759.9 million at November 30, 2007, an increase of $56.0 million, or 8%, as compared to November 30, 2006. Allowance for Loan Losses The following table provides a summary of the composition of the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 Balance at beginning of year $ 759,925 $ 703,917 $ 795,722 $ 910,261 $ 963,093 Additions: Provision for loan losses 1,595,615 733,887 606,765 816,197 893,531 Deductions: Charge offs (1,147,240 ) (839,092 ) (852,636 ) (1,076,179 ) (1,061,084 ) Recoveries 166,285 161,213 154,066 145,642 114,721 Net charge offs (980,955 ) (677,879 ) (698,570 ) (930,537 ) (946,363 ) Translation adjustments and other (199 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,374,585 $ 759,925 $ 703,917 $ 795,722 $ 910,261 Net Charge offs Our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day contractual time frame. The net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period. The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Net charge offs $ 980,955 4.59 % $ 677,879 3.40 % $ 698,570 3.63 % $ 930,537 4.93 % $ 946,363 5.71 % The net charge off rate on our loan receivables increased 119 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2008 compared to November 30, 2007. The higher net charge off rate was due to higher delinquencies beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the weakening economic environment as a result of rising unemployment, declining housing prices and the decrease in the availability of consumer credit, as well as an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs. 63 Table of Contents The net charge off rate on loan receivables declined 23 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. This decline reflected a continued lower level of bankruptcy related charge offs following the October 2005 effective date of the new U.S. bankruptcy legislation, offset in part by a higher level of contractual charge offs. The bankruptcy legislation, which made it more difficult for individuals to declare bankruptcy, resulted in a surge in bankruptcy receipts and related charge offs in 2005 and early 2006. Accordingly, the year ended November 30, 2006 was adversely impacted by an elevated level of charge offs in the first quarter. Delinquencies and Non Performing Loans Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. Loan receivables are placed on non accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember, as part of certain collection management processes, and other instances in which management feels collectibility is not assured. The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days past due, loan receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands): At November 30, 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Loans over 30 days delinquent $ 1,096,627 4.35 % $ 679,306 3.26 % $ 633,150 3.05 % $ 756,198 3.67 % $ 790,512 4.18 % Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest $ 444,324 1.76 % $ 271,227 1.30 % $ 244,675 1.17 % $ 263,439 1.26 % $ 342,324 1.64 % Loans not accruing interest $ 173,123 0.69 % $ 102,286 0.49 % $ 110,625 0.53 % $ 215,671 1.05 % $ 116,596 0.62 % The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 109 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively, at November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. This increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our cardmembers ability to pay their loan balances. Delinquency rates normally rise as charge offs rise, however, in 2008, we experienced a pattern of charge offs rising faster than delinquencies due to greater percentage of delinquent accounts flowing into the later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge off and due to an increase in consumer bankruptcy filings. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2008 increased 20 basis points to 0.69%, as compared to November 30, 2007, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications. The delinquency rate of our loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 21 basis points and 13 basis points, respectively, at November 30, 2007, as compared to November 30, 2006, as a result of a weakening U.S. economy. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2007 decreased 4 basis points to 0.49%, as compared to November 30, 2006, as a result of lower bankruptcies. Maturities and Sensitivities of Loan Receivables to Changes in Interest Rates Our loan receivables had the following maturity distribution(1) at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Due OneYear orLess Due AfterOne YearThroughFive Years Due AfterFive Years Total Credit card $ 5,770,208 $ 12,071,108 $ 5,972,991 $ 23,814,307 Other 1,012 483,185 918,107 1,402,304 Loan receivables $ 5,771,220 $ 12,554,293 $ 6,891,098 $ 25,216,611 (1) Because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, which historically have been higher than contractually required minimum payments, this amount may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments. 64 Table of Contents At November 30, 2008, of our loan receivables due after one year, approximately $8.3 billion had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $11.1 billion were fixed rate loans. Other Income The principal component of other income is securitization income.

Total other income increased $887.8 million, or 26%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, primarily as a result of an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and higher securitization income, partially offset by a decline in loan fee income as balance transfer fees were reported in interest income beginning in the third quarter 2008. Total other income was relatively flat for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, as higher securitization income and other income were largely offset by lower discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. Within other income, this change to allocating discount and interchange revenue has the effect of decreasing discount and interchange revenue and increasing securitization income. The amount of discount and interchange revenue allocated to securitization transactions has increased since this change was made in 2004 and is expected to continue increasing as new transactions which include such allocations are completed and or securitizations transactions that did not receive allocations mature. For the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were 84%, 67% and 53%, respectively, of average securitized loans to which discount and interchange revenue was allocated. To broaden merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards, we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late 2006. In addition, we have sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and reduce costs. As the outsourcing continues, merchant discount has been replaced by acquirer interchange and assessments, which reduces the percentage of income per transaction and, over time, operating expenses as we no longer incur costs to acquire and service small and mid sized merchants. The lower cost per transaction is generally expected to be offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance. Gains on the sale of merchant acquiring portfolios are reflected in other income as earned. 65 Table of Contents Securitization Income Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through the securitization and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card receivables we originated. The issuance of asset backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition. Also, portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our residual interests in those transactions. Investors in securitizations are allocated the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue earned on securitized loans. In addition, for securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. These cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows remaining are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests. Securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans. For the years ended November 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the average securitized loans were $27.7 billion, $27.0 billion and $25.2 billion, respectively.

For the year ended November 30, 2008, securitization income increased $105.5 million, or 5%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007 primarily reflecting higher excess spread on securitized loans offset in part by a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests, which are detailed further in the tables and discussion below. For the year ended November 30, 2007, securitization income increased $58.8 million, or 3%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The increase reflects higher excess spread and servicing fees related to a higher level of average securitized loans, offset in part by a lower net revaluation of retained interests. 66 Table of Contents Excess spread. The following table provides the components of excess spread (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Interest income on securitized loans $ 3,853,266 $ 3,794,272 $ 3,541,307 $ 58,994 2 % $ 252,965 7 % Interest paid to investors in asset backed securities (1,068,915 ) (1,517,858 ) (1,324,312 ) 448,943 30 % (193,546 ) (15 %) Net interest income 2,784,351 2,276,414 2,216,995 507,937 22 % 59,419 3 % Other fee revenue on securitized loans(1) 1,259,182 1,135,347 965,354 123,835 11 % 169,993 18 % Net charge offs on securitized loans (1,472,989 ) (1,119,508 ) (1,056,707 ) (353,481 ) (32 %) (62,801 ) (6 %) Net revenues on securitized loans 2,570,544 2,292,253 2,125,642 278,291 12 % 166,611 8 % Servicing fees on securitized loans (553,398 ) (538,409 ) (506,417 ) (14,989 ) (3 %) (31,992 ) (6 %) Excess spread $ 2,017,146 $ 1,753,844 $ 1,619,225 $ 263,302 15 % $ 134,619 8 % (1) Other fee income includes discount and interchange revenue, loan fee income and fee products revenue. For the year ended November 30, 2008, excess spread on securitized loans increased $263.3 million, or 15%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. The increase was attributable to higher net interest income and higher other fee revenue on securitized loans offset in part by higher net charge offs. The increase in net interest income related largely to a decrease in interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average LIBOR on floating rate investor interests, offset in part by higher premiums paid to investors on new transactions. Higher other fee revenue was attributable to the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. The higher net charge offs were reflective of the weakening economic and credit environment. For the year ended November 30, 2007, excess spread on securitized loans increased $134.6 million, or 8%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due primarily to a higher level of average securitized loans and other fee revenue on securitized loans resulting from the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. Although net interest income increased as a result of the higher level of average securitized loans, the net interest spread for the year ended November 30, 2007 was lower due to a higher rate of return paid on floating rate investor interest due to higher average LIBOR. Servicing fees on securitized loans. We are paid a servicing fee from the cash flows generated by the securitized loans. Servicing fees are paid to the Company for servicing the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements. These cash flows include interest income and loan fee income as well as discount and interchange revenue for certain securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2008, servicing fees increased $15.0 million, or 3%, from the prior year due to a higher level of securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2007, servicing fees increased $32.0 million, or 6%, from the prior year due to a higher level of securitized loans. 67 Table of Contents Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ $ Initial gain on new securitization transactions(1) $ 71,872 $ 122,949 $ 96,724 $ (51,077 ) $ 26,225 Revaluation of retained interests (191,196 ) (71,603 ) 59,897 (119,593 ) (131,500 ) Net revaluation of retained interests $ (119,324 ) $ 51,346 $ 156,621 $ (170,670 ) $ (105,275 ) (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2008 decreased $170.7 million, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. The decrease included $51.1 million lower initial gains on a lower level of securitization activity ($5.6 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to $8.5 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2007) and lower projected excess spread on new securitizations as a result of higher charge offs. The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests of $191.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2008 largely related to unfavorable changes in assumptions used to value the interest only strip receivable as compared to the previous period end, including lower projected excess spread. The lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge offs, higher interest rate projections and widening spreads on new securitizations as a result of the current trends in the securitization markets. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2007 decreased $105.3 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The unfavorable net revaluation of retained interests of $71.6 million for the year ended November 30, 2007 was primarily attributable to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions. This was offset in part by higher projected excess spread at November 30, 2007, reflecting the lower absolute interest rate environment as compared to that assumed at the prior year end. The year ended November 30, 2007 also reflected a higher initial gain as a result of a higher level of new securitization transactions as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. Loan Fee Income Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, cash advance and other miscellaneous fees. Loan fee income decreased $75.5 million, or 22%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007, respectively, as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees beginning in the second quarter of 2008 historically accounted for in loan fee income. Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2008, balance transfer fees are accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Loan fee income increased $12.3 million, or 4%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, reflecting higher balance transfer fees partially offset by lower late and overlimit fees. Discount and Interchange Revenue Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions and acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by cardholders at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually 68 Table of Contents established and is based on the card issuing organizations transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmembers purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which results in a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and an increase in securitization income. However, cardmember rewards costs associated with the securitized loans are not allocated to investor interests, and as such, do not impact securitization income. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $53.4 million, or 22% for the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to November 30, 2007, due to higher allocations to securitized loans, partially offset by lower cardholder rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized loans receiving such allocations in the current year than in 2007. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $110.8 million, or 31%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, due to higher allocations to securitized loans and higher cardmember rewards, partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue earned related to increased sales volume. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized loans receiving allocations than in 2006 while the increase in cardmember rewards reflected higher sales volume. Fee Products We earn revenue related to fees received for marketing credit related ancillary products including debt deferment/debt cancellation contracts and identity theft protection services to cardmembers. The amount of revenue recorded is based on the terms of the agreements and contracts with third party providers. We recognize this income over the agreement or contract period as earned. Fee products income increased $35.2 million, or 16%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, primarily related to debt deferment/debt cancellation and identity theft protection revenues as a result of increased marketing of these products. Fee products income increased $22.5 million, or 12%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006, primarily related to higher debt deferment/debt cancellation revenue. Merchant Fees Merchant fees consist primarily of fees charged to merchants for various services including manual authorization of transactions and delivery of hardcopy statements. For the year ended November 30, 2008, merchant fees decreased $25.5 million, or 28%, as compared to November 30, 2007 and merchant fees decreased $16.7 million, or 15%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The decrease in both periods is due to increased outsourcing to merchant acquirers. As merchant acquiring portfolios are sold to third party merchant acquirers, this revenue will decrease along with associated costs. Transaction Processing Revenue Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing ATM, debit and point of sale transactions over the PULSE Network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. Transaction processing revenue increased $16.3 million, or 16%, for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to November 30, 2007, primarily due to increased volumes of transactions processed on the network partially offset by pricing incentives. Transaction processing revenue increased $5.2 million, or 5%, for the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to November 30, 2006, primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by pricing incentives. 69 Table of Contents Loss on Investment Securities Loss on investment securities includes realized gains and losses on the sale of investments as well as any write downs of investment securities to fair value when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary. In both 2008 and 2007, we concluded there had been an other than temporary impairment in our investment in the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC, which invested in mortgage backed securities, resulting in a $49.1 million and $11.4 million write down of the notes in the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to monitor the value of the investment. Future valuations may result in further impairment of the investment. In comparison, there were no material losses on investment securities for the year ended November 30, 2006. Antitrust Litigation Settlement Amounts received in conjunction with the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, including related interest, are recorded in this line item when earned. In 2008, we received an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Other Income Other income includes revenues from the sale of merchant portfolios to third party acquirers, royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income increased $60.4 million in 2008, primarily due to the inclusion of Diners Club revenue and reporting an unrealized gain on interest rate swap agreements for the year ended November 30, 2008 compared to an unrealized loss for the year ended November 30, 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower gains from sales of merchant portfolios. Other income increased $48.2 million, or 159%, for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to November 30, 2006 related to gains from sales of merchant portfolios and revenue from the referral of declined applications. This increase was partially offset by losses recorded in recognizing our interest rate swap agreements not designated as fair value swaps at their fair value. Other Expense The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2007 vs. 2006increase(decrease) 2008 2007 2006 $ % $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 845,392 $ 850,065 $ 864,565 $ (4,673 ) (1 %) $ (14,500 ) (2 %) Marketing and business development 530,901 576,263 561,751 (45,362 ) (8 %) 14,512 3 % Information processing and communications 315,943 330,053 331,159 (14,110 ) (4 %) (1,106 ) 0 % Professional fees 349,484 361,409 339,784 (11,925 ) (3 %) 21,625 6 % Premises and equipment 80,394 79,442 80,325 952 1 % (883 ) (1 %) Other expense 293,683 280,982 289,474 12,701 5 % (8,492 ) (3 %) Total other expense $ 2,415,797 $ 2,478,214 $ 2,467,058 $ (62,417 ) (3 %) $ 11,156 0 % 70 Table of Contents Total other expense decreased $62.4 million, or 3% for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by lower marketing expenditures, lower information processing and communications and lower professional fees, partially offset by the inclusion of Diners Club expenses. Marketing fees decreased $45.4 million, or 8% in the same period due to lower direct marketing activity partially offset by increased internet and television advertising. Information processing and communications fees declined due to lower depreciation expense as certain assets became fully depreciated in 2008. Professional fees decreased $11.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to lower legal fees relating to lower general, regulatory and routine advisory legal fees partially offset by an increase in legal fees associated with collection fees. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased due to a pension credit as a result of the announcement of the freezing of benefit accruals under the pension plans in 2008 partially offset by higher compensation costs. Total other expense was relatively flat for the year ended November 30, 2007, as compared to November 30, 2006 as higher professional fees and marketing expenses were largely offset by lower employee compensation and benefits and other expense. Professional fees increased $21.6 million, or 6%, primarily due to spin off related costs partially offset by lower overhead allocations from Morgan Stanley. Marketing and business development increased $14.5 million, or 3%, due to increased acquisition spending partially offset by reduced advertising. Employee compensation and benefits decreased $14.5 million, or 2%, primarily related to a decrease in overhead allocations from Morgan Stanley and lower benefit and commission costs partially offset by higher salaries and higher amortization related to Founders Grant awards. Other expense decreased $8.5 million, or 3%, related to lower licenses and fees expenses. Income Tax Expense For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2008 2007 2006 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits 2.5 2.2 1.8 Federal examinations and settlements (2.3 ) State examinations and settlements (0.9 ) (0.1 ) (1.3 ) Non deductible spin off costs 0.2 Other (0.7 ) (0.5 ) (1.1 ) Effective income tax rate 35.9 % 36.8 % 32.1 % Income tax expense increased $33.2 million, or 6%, for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting an increase in pretax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased 1% for the year ended November 30, 2008 from 36.8% for the year ended November 30, 2007 as a result of the settlement of certain state examination issues, which resulted in a tax benefit during 2008. Income tax expense increased $26.0 million, or 5%, in the year ended November 30, 2007 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2006. The year ended November 30, 2006 benefited from a favorable resolution of tax examination issues addressed during the course of a federal tax audit for the years 1997 through 1998 and the favorable settlement of state tax matters. The year ended November 30, 2007, includes the impact of filing state combined returns exclusive of Morgan Stanley. Liquidity and Capital Resources We maintain liquidity, capital and funding strategies designed to optimize our credit ratings and provide that our bank capitalization levels are sufficient to allow for cost effective access to debt and deposit markets, thus providing sufficient liquidity to fund our business over both the short and long term. Our liquidity and funding risk management strategies are designed to mitigate the risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to fund our business and service our financial obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk is addressed 71 Table of Contents through various funding criteria and targets that guide our access to the long term and short term debt capital markets and various deposit distribution channels, the maturity profile of our liabilities, the diversity of our funding sources and investor base, as well as the level of our liquidity reserve. Liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including our maturity profile, which measures funding in various maturity tranches. The maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are appropriately staggered. The mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to assess whether there is appropriate diversification. Our primary funding sources include deposits (sourced directly or through brokers), term asset backed securitizations, asset backed commercial paper conduit financing and short term borrowings. We monitor and review liquidity and capital management strategies seeking to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and capital. Our senior management reviews financial performance relative to these strategies, monitors the availability of alternative financing sources, evaluates liquidity risk and capital adequacy, and assesses the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. Certain of our borrowing costs and the ability to raise funds in specific ratings sensitive markets are directly impacted by our credit ratings. Discover Bank and Discover Financial Services have maintained investment grade ratings. Discover Bank has a BBB rating from Standard & Poors, a Baa2 deposit and Baa2 senior unsecured rating from Moodys Investors Service and a BBB rating from Fitch Ratings. Discover Financial Services has a BBB long term rating from Standard & Poors, a Baa3 senior unsecured rating from Moodys Investors Service and a BBB long term rating from Fitch Ratings. Moodys Investors Service recently changed its outlook for the credit ratings of Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank from Stable to Negative. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. We maintain a process designed to evaluate our liquidity position and our vulnerabilities to disruptions in our funding markets. This process results in contingency funding plans that model a range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to: (i) repayment of all debt maturing within an assumed stress period; (ii) expected funding requirements from receivable maintenance, growth and or volatility; and (iii) customer cash withdrawals from interest bearing deposits. These stress scenarios are designed to evaluate both short term liquidity stress as well as a prolonged liquidity stress event. In a liquidity stress event, we would seek to increase deposits, liquidate investments and use contingent funding sources to fund our loan receivables and meet our other liquidity needs. At November 30, 2008, our contingent funding sources included approximately $9.4 billion in our liquidity reserve (primarily invested in Federal Funds sold and triple A rated money market mutual funds), $1.5 billion of unutilized commitments from third party commercial paper asset backed conduits for securitization funding, and $2.4 billion of unsecured committed credit. In addition, we had $5.2 billion of available capacity through the Federal Reserve discount window, which includes access to $2.4 billion through the Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility. In addition, management may seek to reduce business funding requirements by implementing asset reduction strategies. Notwithstanding the challenging conditions in the financial markets during the past year, we have satisfied all maturing obligations and funded our business operations by utilizing the multiple funding sources more fully described below. We expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations during the next 12 months through access to our multiple funding sources, with primary reliance on deposits. In the event that existing access to deposit channels becomes disrupted and or access to the capital markets continues to be disrupted during the next 12 months, we believe that we would be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund normal business operations during that time by utilizing our multiple sources of contingent funding more fully described below, including our liquidity reserve, asset backed commercial paper conduit capacity, committed credit facility capacity and Federal Reserve discount window capacity. 72 Table of Contents Equity Capital Management. Management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. We determine the level of capital necessary to support our business based on our managed loan receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, taking into account, among other things, regulatory requirements, rating agency guidelines and internally managed requirements to sustain growth. Equity increased to $5.9 billion in November 30, 2008 from $5.6 billion in November 30, 2007. The level of capital throughout 2009 is expected to be positively impacted by the Visa and Master Card antitrust litigation settlement more fully described below, which will contribute to capital in 2009. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC insured financial institutions must maintain minimum levels of capital that are dependent upon the risk of the financial institutions assets, specifically (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (leverage ratio), (b) 4% to 6% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio) and (c) 8% to 10% of total capital, as defined, to risk weighted assets (total risk weighted capital ratio). At November 30, 2008, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk weighted capital ratio and total risk weighted capital ratio of Discover Bank as well as those of our other FDIC insured financial institution, Bank of New Castle, exceeded these regulatory minimums. U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA) was signed into law. Under EESA, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the U.S. Treasury) has the authority to, among other things, invest in financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Treasury announced its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), under which it is purchasing senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy. We are seeking to participate in the CPP for additional capital to support our consumer lending operations and other businesses. On January 14, 2009, we received preliminary approval from the U.S. Treasury to participate in the CPP, subject to standard closing conditions. We expect to issue and sell to the U.S. Treasury shares of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the CPP for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S Treasury will grant final approval of our application or, if approved, what the size of any investment by the U.S Treasury ultimately will be. In connection with participating in the CPP, we would become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Our application to become a bank holding company was approved by the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 19, 2008. The senior preferred stock would qualify as Tier 1 capital and would pay a cumulative dividend rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and a rate of nine percent per annum after year five. The senior preferred stock would be non voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock. The senior preferred stock would be redeemable after three years with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Prior to the end of three years, the senior preferred stock may be redeemed with the proceeds from a qualifying equity offering of any Tier 1 perpetual preferred or common stock resulting in proceeds of not less than 25 percent of the issue price of the senior preferred stock. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time. Participation in the CPP would restrict our ability to increase dividends on our common stock or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. In conjunction with the purchase of senior preferred stock, the U.S. Treasury would receive warrants to purchase a number of shares of common stock with an aggregate market price equal to 15 percent of the senior preferred investment. The exercise price on the warrants would be the market price of our common stock, calculated on a 20 trading day trailing average. For more information, see U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. 73 Table of Contents Dividend Policy. Although we intend to reinvest a substantial portion of our earnings in our business, we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, as a result of applicable banking regulations and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be further limited. If we participate in the CPP, we will be prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock for a period of three years unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, dividend payments on our common stock will be prohibited unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock. Share Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock under a new share repurchase program. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. At November 30, 2008, we had not repurchased any stock under this program. If we participate in the CPP, we will be prohibited from repurchasing our common stock for a period of three years, except in connection with the administration of an employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock issued under the CPP is outstanding, we may not repurchase any of our shares of common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock. Settlement of Visa and MasterCard Antitrust Litigation. On October 27, 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. In the fourth quarter 2008, we received an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard as payment in full of its portion of the settlement, which we recorded in other income in the U.S. Card segment. In 2009, we expect to earn the remaining amount in four quarterly payments of up to $472 million each from Visa. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Impact of Proposed Revisions to FASB Statement No. 140 and FASB Interpretation 46R. The trusts used in our securitizations currently are not consolidated on our financial statements for reporting purposes because the trusts are qualifying special purpose entities under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (Statement No. 140). The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued proposed amendments to Statement No. 140 and FASB Interpretation No. 46R. As currently drafted, these amendments will require us to consolidate our securitization trusts on our balance sheet, which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, including our capital requirements. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Changes to the accounting treatment of securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, reserve requirements, capital requirements, liquidity, cost of funds and operations. Securities Available for Sale. As of November 30, 2008, Discover Bank held $1.1 billion in available for sale investment securities. This amount includes $981.7 million of certificated retained interests in DCENT. Our available for sale investment securities also include $85.8 million of investments made in highly rated third party credit card asset backed securities. As of November 30, 2008, the weighted average life of all of our available for sale investment securities was approximately 2 years. 74 Table of Contents Funding Sources Securitization Financing. Historically, we have used the securitization of credit card receivables as our largest single source of funding, including both the public securitization market and the privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduit financing market. Due to recent market events and continued disruption in the capital markets, the securitization markets have not been available at volumes and pricing levels that would be attractive to us. Our last public securitization transaction closed on June 18, 2008, and our last private asset backed commercial paper conduit transaction closed on August 28, 2008. It is difficult to predict if or when the securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels, but we currently do not expect to be able to access these markets during 2009. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the introduction of the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (the TALF) in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities and improve the market conditions for asset backed securities generally. It is unclear at this time what impact the TALF program will have on returning the securitization market to historical capacity and pricing levels. Our response to the tightened securitization markets has been, and will continue to be, utilization of deposits. For more information, see the Outlook section at the beginning of this Item 7 and Deposits below. We use non consolidated securitization trusts to securitize our credit card loan receivables. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are accounted for as sold and, accordingly, are removed from the consolidated statements of financial condition. We have historically securitized between approximately 50% and 60% of our managed credit card loan receivables. Outstanding public and private asset backed commercial paper conduit financing at November 30, 2008 were $20.7 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. At November 30, 2008, we had $1.5 billion in unused asset backed commercial paper conduit capacity. The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of the investors interests in securitizations at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year(1) One YearThroughThree Years(2) Four YearsThroughFive Years AfterFive Years Scheduled maturities of the investors interest in securitizations $ 25,559,744 $ 4,989,475 $ 14,875,530 $ 3,705,265 $ 1,989,474 (1) In the first quarter of 2009, we have total contractual maturities of investors interest of $3.1 billion. (2) In 2010, we have total contractual maturities of investors interest of $10.3 billion. We access the public asset securitization market through the Discover Card Master Trust I and, beginning July 26, 2007, DCENT, using receivables generated by our U.S. Card business. Through the Discover Card Master Trust I, we have used a structure utilizing Class A, triple A rated certificates and Class B, single A rated certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates and a cash collateral account. DCENT includes three classes of securities sold to investors, the most senior class generally receiving a triple A rating. In this structure, in order to issue senior, higher rated classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower rated classes of notes. As of November 30, 2008, we had triple A rated note issuance capacity of $5.0 billion in DCENT, subject to market availability. In order to maintain this level of triple A rated note issuance capacity, we have purchased $1.1 billion principal amount of subordinated notes issued by DCENT, which are classified as available for sale investment securities for accounting purposes. In the future, we may purchase additional subordinated notes to maintain our triple A rated note issuance capacity. As of November 30, 2008, cash collateral accounts providing credit enhancement for the securitization transactions of Discover Card Master Trust I had a balance of $1.3 billion. Discover Financial Services financed 75 Table of Contents $1.2 billion of cash collateral accounts (reflected in amounts due from asset securitizations in the consolidated statements of financial condition at its fair value, which was $1.1 billion at November 30, 2008). The rights to repayment of a portion of the cash collateral account loans have been sold to a special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, as part of a $0.7 billion secured financing and are not expected to be available to creditors of Discover Financial Services. The following table summarizes scheduled maturities of the cash collateral accounts at November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years AfterFive Years Scheduled maturities of cash collateral accounts $ 1,163,685 $ 321,316 $ 655,263 $ 127,895 $ 59,211 The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the underlying securities, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as economic early amortization. In the event of an economic early amortization (which would occur if the excess spread (the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged off receivables) falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three month rolling average), the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our consolidated statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities. As of November 30, 2008, no economic early amortization events have occurred.

Deposits. We utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short term credit sensitive funding sources, thus enhancing our liquidity position. Our response to the disruptions in the securitization market has been, and we anticipate will continue to be, increased utilization of deposits. We obtain our deposits through two channels: (1) agency arrangements with securities brokerage firms, which place deposits with their customers; and, increasingly, (2) products offered directly to consumers through direct mail, internet origination and affinity relationships, including certificates of deposit and money market accounts. We currently utilize six of the largest securities brokerage firms to obtain deposit funding through distribution of our certificates of deposit to their customers. Four of these six brokerage firms have external selling group capability, which allows them to distribute deposits through other brokerage firms (which can exceed a group of 200 brokers). We have elected to use the selling group capabilities of these brokerage firms to extend deposit gathering capabilities for cost effectiveness. 76 Table of Contents Our certificates of deposit have maturities ranging from one month to fifteen years, and had a weighted average maturity of 28 months at November 30, 2008, which is up from 22 months at November 30, 2007 as a result of issuances of deposits with longer maturities. Total interest bearing deposits at November 30, 2008 were $28.5 billion, the remaining maturities of which are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands): Total ThreeMonths orLess Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths Over TwelveMonths Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000(1) $ 22,083,962 $ 2,359,276 $ 2,162,925 $ 2,294,831 $ 15,266,930 Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000(1) or greater 1,808,320 216,453 210,886 415,712 965,269 Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts 4,559,864 4,559,864 Total interest bearing deposits $ 28,452,146 $ 7,135,593 $ 2,373,811 $ 2,710,543 $ 16,232,199 (1) Represents the basic insurance amount covered by the FDIC. Effective October 23, 2008, the United States Congress temporarily increased FDIC deposit insurance to $250,000 through December 31, 2009. Short Term Borrowings. Short term borrowings consist of borrowings through the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility, term, overnight Federal Funds purchased and other short term borrowings with original maturities of less than one year. On November 6, 2008, Discover Bank borrowed $500 million through the Term Auction Facility at an interest rate of 60 bps for a period of 84 days. This allowed Discover Bank to obtain funding at a lower interest rate than alternatives existing at that time. The following table identifies the balances and weighted average interest rates on short term borrowings outstanding at and for the years ended (dollars in thousands): November 30, 2008 November 30, 2007 November 30, 2006 MaximumMonth End BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate MaximumMonth End BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate MaximumMonthEnd BalanceDuring Year Year EndAmount Year EndWeightedAverageInterest Rate Overnight Federal Funds purchased $ 250,000 $ $ 3,430,000 $ 250,000 4.68 % $ 3,000,000 $ 3,000,000 5.31 % Term Federal Funds purchased $ 500,000 500,000 0.60 % $ 540,000 $ 1,769,000 100,000 5.35 % Other short term borrowings $ $ 2,106,124 $ 4,655,321 1,811,124 5.46 % Total short term borrowings $ 500,000 0.60 % $ 250,000 $ 4,911,124 Long Term Debt and Bank Notes. At November 30, 2008, we had $400 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes outstanding which mature in June 2010 and $400 million principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding which mature in June 2017. Additionally, we had $250 million principal amount of bank notes outstanding at November 30, 2008 which mature in February 2009. In October 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the TLGP) pursuant to which the FDIC will guarantee the timely payment of interest and principal on certain newly issued senior unsecured debt of eligible entities issued on or before June 30, 2009. Discover Bank has opted into the TLGP and is eligible to receive the benefit of the TLGP guarantee in connection with the issuance of senior unsecured debt of up to $312.5 million. While it is unclear at this time whether Discover Bank will be issuing unsecured debt pursuant to the TLGP, our participation in this program may provide us access to an additional source of funding. 77 Table of Contents Available Credit Facilities Secured Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources. In connection with our asset securitization program, we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through privately placed asset backed commercial paper conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At November 30, 2008, these conduits totaled $6.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion was unused. The original commitments of these facilities range from 364 day renewable agreements to multi year extendable commitments. Unsecured Committed Credit Facilities. As of November 30, 2008, our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.4 billion had a remaining life of 42 months. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility became effective at the time of the Distribution, is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank (Discover Financial Services may borrow up to 30% and Discover Bank may borrow up to 100% of the total commitment). We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time. At November 30, 2008, we had no outstanding balances due under the facility. Federal Reserve. Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias discount window and has participated in the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility. In December 2007, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a temporary Term Auction Facility. All depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program are eligible to participate in Term Auction Facility auctions. Discover Bank had $5.2 billion of available capacity through the Federal discount window as of November 30, 2008, which was reduced to $4.7 billion after we borrowed an additional $500 million through the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility in December 2008. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements See Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Sources Securitization Financing. Guarantees Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed on the Discover Network, transactions processed by Diners Club licensees and indemnifications made in conjunction with the sale of the Goldfish business. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement. See Note 21: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. 78 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2008 include deposits, long term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2008 are summarized below (dollars in thousands): Payments Due By Period Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years More ThanFive Years Deposits(1) $ 28,530,521 $ 12,298,322 $ 8,657,292 $ 5,932,728 $ 1,642,179 Bank notes(2) 250,000 250,000 Secured borrowings(3) 682,456 154,210 528,246 Unsecured borrowings(4) 800,000 400,000 400,000 Capital lease obligations(5) 3,646 1,391 2,255 Operating leases(5) 37,766 5,872 10,155 7,572 14,167 Interest payments on fixed rate debt 232,200 25,800 51,600 51,600 103,200 Purchase obligations(6) 403,706 208,680 121,264 34,770 38,992 Total contractual obligations $ 30,940,295 $ 12,944,275 $ 9,770,812 $ 6,026,670 $ 2,198,538 (1) See Note 10: Deposits to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our deposits. The certificates of deposit accrue interest at fixed rates. All other interest bearing deposits accrue interest at variable rates. (2) See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $1.3 million as of November 30, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 2.54% at November 30, 2008. (3) Interest charges on secured borrowings, of which the full repayment is dependent upon the available balances of the cash collateral accounts at the maturities of the underlying securitization transactions, are based on a fifty basis point spread over monthly commercial paper issuance costs. See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $32.3 million as of November 30, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 3.05% at November 30, 2008. (4) See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate note is estimated to be $20.8 million as of November 30, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 3.35% at November 30, 2008. Total future payment of interest charges for the fixed rate note is equal to the amount reported in the table above under Interest payments on fixed rate debt. The fixed rate note is recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition net of discounts. (5) See Note 21: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our capital and operating lease obligations. (6) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license and telecommunications agreements. Purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2008 reflect the minimum collateral obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition. As of November 30, 2008 the Companys consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefit of $285.6 million, and approximately $29.6 million of accrued interest and penalties. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated income tax obligations associated with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48) have been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 18: Income Taxes to our consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our FIN 48 obligations. At November 30, 2008, we extended credit for consumer and commercial loans of approximately $207 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated and combined financial statements. 79 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally managed loan receivables. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, deposits, and short term and long term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree. Our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables, Federal Funds sold, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest earning deposits and certain investment securities. Portions of our credit card loan receivables have fixed interest rates, although we currently have the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate unless the account has been closed or the cardmember opts out of repricing actions. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2008, we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities (reported on a managed basis) over the following 12 month period would be reduced by approximately $38 million. We estimate the comparable reduction of pretax income for the 12 month period following November 30, 2007 to be approximately $108 million. A predominate portion of this change can be attributed to changes we made to our market risk model. We have moved from a static view of future balances towards a more dynamic approach that portrays our business forecast. The change is also due to having fewer interest rate sensitive liabilities. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. As of November 30, 2008, we believe our foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial. 80 Table of Contents
