Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K particularly under Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to Notes to our consolidated financial statements are to the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of November 30, 2009 and 2008 and for the three year period ended November 30, 2009. Introduction and Overview Discover Financial Services is a leading credit card issuer in the United States and an electronic payment services company. In March 2009, we became a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act in connection with our participation in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program (CPP). Therefore, we are now subject to oversight, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). Through our Discover Bank subsidiary, we offer our customers credit cards, other consumer loans and deposit products. Through our DFS Services LLC subsidiary and its subsidiaries, we operate the Discover Network, the PULSE Network and Diners Club. The Discover Network operates a credit card transaction processing network for Discover card branded and third party issued credit cards. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE Network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally, as well as point of sale terminals at retail locations throughout the U.S. for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network that grants rights to licensees, which are generally financial institutions, to issue Diners Club branded credit cards and or to provide card acceptance services. Our Diners Club business also offers transaction processing and marketing services to licensees globally. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. Our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables, securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions, and fees earned from customers, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provisions, customer rewards, and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables. Our business activities are funded primarily through the raising of consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of both secured and unsecured debt. In a credit card securitization, loan receivables are transferred to a securitization trust, from which beneficial interests are issued to investors. We continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans. The trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries. These trusts are excluded from our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Because our securitization activities qualify as sales under GAAP and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions, we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investors interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition. As a result, asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements in that the portions of interest income, net charge offs and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. As described in Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations, pursuant to new accounting guidance, the securitization trusts will be consolidated in our financial statements effective December 1, 2009. Beginning on that date, our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income, but will instead report interest income, net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt. 47 Table of Contents Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided sellers interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is not a presentation in accordance with GAAP, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income. See GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations. 2009 Highlights Net income for 2009 was $1.3 billion, up from $0.9 billion in 2008, which includes $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, of after tax income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement (described further in Legal Proceedings). Results for 2008 also include a $0.1 billion loss related to the sale of the Goldfish business in March 2008. The challenging economic environment included increasing unemployment and higher consumer bankruptcies. As a result, net charge off rates rose steadily throughout 2009 while delinquency rates remain elevated above prior periods. The net charge off rate for 2009 was 7.45% on an owned basis (7.77% on a managed basis), compared to 4.59% on an owned basis in 2008 (5.01% on a managed basis). This increase in our net charge off rates resulted in a $1.5 billion reduction of 2009 pretax income as compared to 2008. Additionally, our over 30 days delinquency rate at November 30, 2009, was 4.92% on an owned basis (5.31% on a managed basis), compared to 4.35% on an owned basis in 2008 (4.56% on a managed basis). In response to these trends, we increased the loan loss reserve rate throughout the year, from 5.45% at November 30, 2008 to 7.44% at November 30, 2009. Despite the challenging economic environment, we maintained a steady level of managed receivables, and ended 2009 with $50.9 billion in managed loans compared to $51.1 billion at the end of 2008. However, owned loans fluctuated throughout the year as a result of securitization maturities and, in the second half of 2009, new securitization transactions. Credit card sales volumes were down 5% in 2009, largely due to lower gasoline prices but also due to the economic environment generally. This decline in sales, along with a lower level of promotional rate offers, contributed to a decline in managed credit card loans, which was largely offset by $2 billion of growth in our personal and student loan products and a lower payment rate on our credit card receivables. During 2009, we took actions that resulted in higher net interest yield on loan receivables, including charging higher standard annual percentage rates and substantially reducing promotional rate offers. These actions, which were partially offset by a higher level of interest charge offs, resulted in a net interest yield on loan receivables of 7.13% in 2009 (9.41% on a managed basis), up from 6.58% in 2008 (8.55% on a managed basis). This higher net interest yield along with a higher average level of owned loans contributed to $1.9 billion in net interest income for 2009 as compared to $1.4 billion in 2008. We strengthened our liquidity and capital position through a number of capital market transactions during the year: In March 2009, through our participation in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program, we issued and sold shares of our preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the U.S. Treasury for approximately $1.2 billion in cash and became a bank holding company; We raised $534 million in a common stock offering of approximately 60 million shares in July and August 2009; We raised a total of $1.1 billion in a senior debt offering in July 2009 and a subordinated debt offering in November 2009; and Our securitization trusts issued $2.8 billion of asset backed securities funded under the Federal Reserves Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) in July and September 2009. We continued to grow our direct to consumer deposits and deposit products offered through affinity relationships, ending 2009 with $12.6 billion of these deposits, an increase of $6.4 billion from 2008. Our total funding from deposits, including brokered deposits, increased to $32.1 billion in 2009 from $28.5 billion in 2008. We significantly reduced our operating expenses in 2009 by reducing promotional rate balance transfer offers and related marketing expenses, lowering headcount, and implementing several cost containment initiatives. As a result, our operating expenses decreased $165 million, or 7%, from 2008. 48 Table of Contents 2008 and 2007 Highlights We acquired Diners Club International (Diners Club) for $168 million on June 30, 2008. Diners Club has network licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded credit cards and or provide card acceptance services in over 185 countries and territories. We sold our U.K. credit card business (Goldfish) to Barclays Bank PLC on March 31, 2008. This business represented substantially all of our International Card segment, which is presented in discontinued operations in this report. On June 30, 2007, we spun off from Morgan Stanley through the distribution of shares of our common stock to holders of Morgan Stanley common stock. Our results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2007 include costs incurred as a result of the distribution of approximately $34 million, including costs that were allocated to the International Card segment, reported as discontinued operations in this report. Outlook The economic environment in 2009 was particularly challenging. Although we have seen some encouraging trends in certain economic indicators and in some of our own statistics, we have yet to see sustained economic improvement. In the last half of 2009, our charge off and delinquency rates continued to rise, although not as quickly as they had risen in the last half of 2008 and into the first half of 2009, indicating that our loan losses might be approaching, but have not yet reached, their peak. We anticipate higher credit losses in 2010 and, given the continued uncertainty regarding the economic environment and somewhat higher level of delinquencies at the end of the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the end of the previous quarter, we increased our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans to 7.44% at November 30, 2009. Additionally, our results in 2010 will not benefit from the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and will be adversely impacted by the new credit card legislation. See Legislative and Regulatory Developments below for a further discussion. We anticipate that adjustments that we made to certain aspects of our business in 2009 in response to the current economic environment and the new credit card legislation will impact our 2010 financial results. Specifically, in the third quarter 2009, we made changes to new and existing accounts, such as increasing standard annual percentage rates and converting many accounts with fixed rates to variable rates. The higher rates charged on standard balances along with a decline in the level of promotional rate offers during the year had a positive impact on our 2009 net interest yield on credit card loan receivables. Although the benefit of these actions will continue to accumulate in 2010, the impact will not be as significant as in 2009 and will also be offset by all of the restrictions under the CARD Act, as described below. We expect to maintain our current level of loan receivables through emphasizing our Cashback Bonus rewards program, our customer service and our other lending products, including student and personal loans. We also took certain actions to reduce our operating expenses in 2009, which included reducing headcount. We plan to invest in marketing and other initiatives to grow our deposit products and our network capabilities, but we will continue to focus on sustaining a lower level of overall operating expenses compared to prior years. At November 30, 2009, we had increased our liquidity reserve, primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents, to $14.2 billion, in anticipation of approximately $12.5 billion of asset backed securities and deposit maturities in the first half of 2010. In 2009, we relied principally on deposits to fund our business, experiencing $3.6 billion growth in our total deposit balance at November 30, 2009 as compared to November 30, 2008, while our level of securitization borrowings from third parties declined by approximately $2.2 billion. In 2010, we plan to continue to grow deposits, particularly direct to consumer deposits, as a percentage of our total funding by using both organic and inorganic methods. Our ability to issue asset backed securities in 2010 depends on a number of factors, including market liquidity as well as legislative and regulatory developments. In 2009, we issued $1.2 billion of senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP. We subsequently raised a total of $1.6 billion in various capital market transactions. We also increased our capital in 2009 through growth in retained earnings. Going forward, as we continue to evaluate our capital levels, we will also evaluate our continued participation in the CPP and we intend, at the appropriate time, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve, to repurchase our preferred stock from the U.S. Treasury. 49 Table of Contents In our payments business, we continue to focus on increasing global volume across the Discover, PULSE and Diners Club networks by leveraging our flexibility, network relationships and emerging payments opportunities. This effort includes the rapid implementation of our U.S. acceptance strategy, which is based on increasing the number of active merchants who accept Discover through the numerous acquiring relationships we have built in recent years. Outside the U.S., we will continue to work with various Diners Club licensees, acquirers and other payment networks to grow volume and continue the expansion of our acceptance footprint, which includes the global cash access network we launched in 2009. In 2010, we expect to make investments in an attempt to grow volume and market share for our payments business around the world. Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (Statement No. 166) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (Statement No. 167). In December 2009, Statement No. 166 was codified within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification under Section 860, Transfers and Servicing, and Statement No. 167 was codified within Section 810, Consolidation. For ease of reference, and to clarify between guidance applicable as of the date of the accompanying financial statements and guidance applicable to future periods, we will continue to refer to Statements No. 166 and 167 under their previous names within this document. Statement No. 166 amends the accounting for transfers of financial assets and will impact the accounting for our credit card asset securitization activities. Under Statement No. 166, the trusts used in our securitization transactions will no longer be exempt from consolidation. Statement No. 167 prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on our financial statements. The assessment under Statement No. 167, which became effective for us on December 1, 2009, will result in the consolidation of the trusts by us as of that date. Using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by Statement No. 167, we expect to record a $21.1 billion increase in total assets, a $22.4 billion increase in total liabilities and a $1.3 billion decrease in stockholders equity (comprised of a $1.4 billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of $0.1 billion in other comprehensive income). 50 Table of Contents The following table shows significant line items on our consolidated statement of financial condition on an actual and pro forma basis, the latter of which gives effect to adjustments expected to be recorded on December 1, 2009 in connection with adopting Statements No. 166 and 167. The adoption of Statements No. 166 and 167 requires a full consolidation of the trusts in accordance with GAAP, which is different from a managed presentation. For further discussion of these differences, see GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations. November 30, 2009 Actual Balance Sheet November 30, 2009 Pro Forma Balance Sheet(1) (dollars in millions) Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,021 $ 13,021 Restricted cash 643 1,882 Investment securities 5,035 534 Loan receivables, gross 23,625 50,854 Allowance for loan losses (1,758 ) (3,902 ) Loan receivables, net 21,867 46,952 Amounts due from asset securitization 1,692 Deferred tax assets 790 1,578 Other assets 2,973 3,151 Total assets $ 46,021 $ 67,118 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Deposits $ 32,093 $ 32,093 Long term borrowings 2,428 24,760 Other liabilities 3,064 3,162 Total liabilities 37,585 60,015 Total stockholders equity 8,436 7,103 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 46,021 $ 67,118 (1) When presented in financial reports beginning in 2010, assets and liabilities of the securitization trusts will be separately presented on the face of the balance sheet, as required by Statement No. 167, to reflect the facts that trust assets can be used only to settle trust obligations and that the trusts creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The pro forma balance sheet as of November 30, 2009 shown above reflects the following adjustments: Consolidation of $22.3 billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors; Reclassification of $4.6 billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables; Recording of a $2.1 billion allowance for loan losses, not previously required under GAAP, for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables; Derecognition of the remaining $0.1 billion value of the interest only strip receivable, net of tax, recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining $1.6 billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash, loan receivables and other assets; and Recording of net deferred tax assets of $0.8 billion, largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables. After adoption, our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income, but will instead report interest income, net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt. Additionally, after adoption, we will no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans will no longer receive sale accounting treatment, nor will there be any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not 51 Table of Contents recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing. Because our securitization transactions will be accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales, the cash flows from these transactions will be presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating or investing activities. Notwithstanding this accounting treatment, our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from Discover Bank and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. We would, however, continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in these trusts. Actions we took in the third quarter of 2009 to adjust the credit enhancement structure of the trusts had the effect of causing the assets of the trusts to be included in our risk weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes effective July 2009. As a result, the consolidation of the trusts under Statement No. 167 on December 1, 2009, had a lesser impact on our regulatory capital calculations than would have otherwise been the case because much of this effect has already been reflected as a result of the trust actions. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Sources Securitization Financing below for further discussion of these trust support actions. However, the $1.4 billion charge to retained earnings as a result of adopting Statement No. 167 will further reduce our regulatory capital ratios, although both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank are expected to remain above well capitalized levels after the adoption of Statements No. 166 and 167. The following table shows our regulatory capital amounts and ratios on an actual and pro forma basis as of November 30, 2009, the latter of which gives effect to the estimated $1.4 billion reduction of retained earnings expected to be recorded on December 1, 2009 in connection with adopting Statements No. 166 and 167: November 30, 2009 Actual November 30, 2009 Pro Forma (dollars in thousands) Discover Financial Services Total Capital $ 9,516,965 $ 8,104,091 Tier 1 Capital $ 8,139,309 $ 6,728,192 Total Risk Based Capital Ratio 17.9 % 15.9 % Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio 15.3 % 13.2 % Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 18.1 % 10.2 % Discover Bank Total Capital $ 8,210,450 $ 6,797,568 Tier 1 Capital $ 6,572,320 $ 5,161,203 Total Risk Based Capital Ratio 15.8 % 13.7 % Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio 12.6 % 10.4 % Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 15.9 % 8.3 % Legislative and Regulatory Developments Legislation Addressing Credit Card Practices In May 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act) was enacted. The CARD Act makes numerous changes to the Truth in Lending Act, affecting the marketing, underwriting, pricing, billing and other aspects of the consumer credit card business. Several provisions of the CARD Act became effective in August 2009, but most of the requirements will become effective in February 2010 and others will become effective in August 2010. Legislation has been proposed to accelerate the effective date of all of the CARD Act provisions effective as soon as the legislation is enacted, but prospects for enactment are uncertain. The CARD Act and its implementing regulations: Prohibit interest rate increases on outstanding balances except under limited circumstances; Prohibit interest rate increases on new balances during the first year an account is opened except under limited circumstances; Require allocation of payments in excess of the required minimum payment to balances with the highest annual percentage rate (APR) before balances with a lower APR (for accounts with different APRs on different balances); Restrict imposition of a default APR on existing balances unless an account is 60 days past due and require that the increased APR resulting from a default be reduced if payments are timely made for six months; 52 Table of Contents Generally require 45 days advance notice be provided prior to increasing any APR (as permitted by the CARD Act) or other significant changes to account terms. Except for certain changes, the notice must include a statement of the cardholders right to cancel the account prior to the effective date of the change; Prohibit the use of the two cycle average daily balance method of calculating interest and prohibit the assessment of interest on any portion of a balance that is repaid within the grace period; Require penalty fees (e.g., late fees and over limit fees) to be reasonable and proportional to the consumers violation of the account terms; Prohibit card issuers from imposing over limit fees unless the cardholder has expressly opted in to the issuer authorizing such over limit transactions, and imposes other limits on such fees; Require card issuers to review accounts at least every six months when an APR has been increased to determine whether the APR should be reduced; Prohibit issuance of a credit card to a consumer under the age of 21 unless there is a co signer over the age of 21 who has a means to repay or the individual under the age of 21 has an independent means to repay; and Require new billing statement disclosures, such as the length of time and cost of paying down the account balances if only minimum payments are made. A number of the CARD Acts requirements reflect our existing practices and will not require modifications of policies or procedures. Restrictions on risk management practices that have been commonplace in the industry already have compelled us, and our competitors, to manage risk through more restrictive underwriting and credit line management, reduce promotional offers and increase annual percentage rates. Certain provisions of the CARD Act, however, such as those addressing limitations on interest rate increases, late and over limit fees and payment allocation, are requiring us to make additional fundamental changes to our current business practices and systems. For example, we have informed our credit card customers that as of certain specified dates we will no longer charge over limit fees, impose fees for payments made over the telephone, or change interest rates on existing balances when a customers payments are late. Full implementation of the CARD Act requires the promulgation of regulations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued final regulations implementing the majority of the provisions of the CARD Act. We are making changes that the CARD Act requires to be implemented in a relatively short timeframe. Other changes must await final regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve. We are continuing to evaluate appropriate modifications to products, revenue generation, marketing strategies and other business practices that will be in compliance with the law, will be attractive to consumers and will provide a good return for our stockholders. The full impact of the CARD Act on us is unknown at this time as it ultimately depends upon Federal Reserve interpretation of some of the provisions, successful implementation of our strategies, consumer behavior, and the actions of our competitors. The CARD Act also requires the Federal Reserve and the Government Accountability Office to conduct various studies, including studies regarding interchange fees, reasons for credit limit reductions and rate increases, small business cards, and credit card terms and disclosures. Based on the results of these studies, new requirements that negatively impact us may be introduced as future legislation or regulation. Other Credit Card and Student Loan Legislation Congress may also consider other legislation affecting our business. Examples include a ceiling on the rate of interest that can be charged on credit cards, restrictions on interchange fees and merchant rules established by the credit card networks, authority for merchants to provide discounts to customers who use certain types of credit or debit cards, and extending the provisions of the CARD Act to business cards. We currently offer both federal and private student loans. In September 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA), which is currently under consideration in the U.S. Senate. If passed in its current form, SAFRA would require all federal student loans to be made directly by the federal government starting July 2010, rather than by private institutions through the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Because SAFRA allows financial institutions to continue offering private student loans, we do not expect SAFRA to have an impact on our ability to continue offering private student loans, even if we discontinue offering student loans under federal programs. 53 Table of Contents Bankruptcy Legislation The Senate Judiciary Committee continues to consider legislation that would disallow claims in Chapter 7 bankruptcy based on high cost consumer debt and exclude consumers with such debt from the bankruptcy means test. The means test requires debtors who can afford to repay a portion of their debts through Chapter 13 repayment plan do so, rather than discharge all indebtedness under Chapter 7. The proposed legislation, if enacted, could increase the percentage of bankruptcy filers who obtain full debt discharges to the detriment of all unsecured lenders, and could result in increased charge offs of our loan receivables. It is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted by Congress. Congress also continues to consider legislation to allow bankruptcy courts to restructure first mortgage loans (e.g., by reducing the loan amount to the value of the collateral, a process referred to as cramdown). This change is likely to increase the number of individuals who file for bankruptcy, which would adversely impact all creditors including us. While the House of Representatives has approved a cramdown bill, it has garnered significant opposition in the Senate and prospects for enactment are unclear. Financial Regulatory Reform Reacting to the financial crisis and proposals from the Administration, Congress is considering extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms. In December 2009, the House of Representatives approved the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Senate Banking Committee plans to consider its own version of financial regulatory reform legislation in February. The bills, though different at present, address risks to the economy and the payments system, especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms, through a variety of measures, including regulatory oversight of nonbanking entities, increased capital requirements, enhanced authority to limit activities and growth, changes in supervisory authority, resolution authority for failed financial firms (and the establishment of a fund to pay for the costs financed by assessments on financial firms with more than $10 billion in assets), enhanced regulation of derivatives and asset backed securities (e.g., requiring loan originators to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securitized exposures), restrictions on executive compensation, and oversight of credit rating agencies. Both bills contain versions of a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA) that would regulate consumer financial services and products, including credit, savings and payment products to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, promote product simplicity and ensure equal access to financial products. The CFPA would have sole rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws and supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over institutions subject to its regulations. The bills would limit the ability of federal laws to preempt state and local law. The President has made the enactment of financial reform legislation a priority, although there is significant opposition to several components, including the creation of a CFPA. Passage of the bills in their present form would have a material adverse impact on us, but prospects for approval of the legislation, and the content of a final bill, are unclear. Additionally, in January 2010, the Administration announced plans to propose a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee over a ten year period on large financial firms to offset the cost of the U.S. Treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Program. As currently outlined, we would be subject to the fee because the size of our balance sheet will exceed the $50 billion threshold established by the proposal after the adoption of newly applicable accounting guidance related to consolidation. As proposed, qualifying institutions would pay 15 basis points on total assets less Tier 1 capital and deposits, beginning June 30, 2010. Whether the fee will be implemented, and in what form, is uncertain. Compensation Developments In June 2009, the U.S. Treasury issued interim final rules implementing the compensation and corporate governance requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which amended the requirements of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended (EESA), as described in our quarterly report for the quarter ended February 28, 2009. The rules apply to us as of June 2009 as a recipient of funds under the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program. These rules were subject to a public comment period which has expired, but no final rule has been adopted. The rules, among other things, set forth prohibitions on incentive compensation payments, provide guidance on the use of restricted stock units, expand restrictions on golden parachute payments, mandate enforcement of clawback provisions unless unreasonable to do so, outline the steps compensation committees must take when evaluating risks posed by 54 Table of Contents compensation arrangements, require the adoption and disclosure of a luxury expenditure policy, and require compliance with federal securities rules and regulations allowing stockholders to have a non binding advisory vote on executive compensation. Under rules issued by the SEC pursuant to EESA, we, as a participant in the Capital Purchase Program, will be required to include a non binding, advisory shareholder vote on the compensation of our executives, as set forth in the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables, and any related material in our proxy statement, at our annual meeting in April. Additionally, new requirements under the U.S. Treasurys rules include enhanced disclosure of perquisites and the use of compensation consultants, and a prohibition on tax gross up payments. In October 2009, the Federal Reserve issued proposed supervisory guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation practices of banking organizations are consistent with safety and soundness. The proposed guidance was subject to a public comment period which has expired, but no final guidance has been issued. The Federal Reserve has also commenced a special horizontal review of compensation practices at 28 large complex banking organizations, including us. The financial regulatory reform bill approved by the House of Representatives in December 2009, which is described above, would impose additional disclosures and restrictions on compensation paid by financial institutions if enacted. The bill also would require the regulation of inappropriate or imprudently risky compensation practices. FDIC Rule Regarding Securitizations While we have capacity to issue new asset backed securities from our securitization trusts, there has been uncertainty in the securitization market recently as a result of revised accounting standards and related guidance from the FDIC. The ability of issuers of asset backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has been based, in part, on the FDICs rule entitled Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection with a Securitization or Participation, which provides that the FDIC will not seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP. Pursuant to FASB guidance for transfers of financial assets, effective for us on December 1, 2009, certain transfers of assets to special purpose entities (including Discover Banks transfer of assets to the Discover Card Master Trust) no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment. Consequently, there has been uncertainty in the securitization market as to how the FDIC will treat assets transferred into securitization vehicles under the new FASB guidance. This uncertainty had made it difficult or impossible to obtain the necessary credit ratings for the issuances of asset backed securities, including the required ratings for securities to qualify as eligible securities under TALF. In November 2009, the FDIC issued an interim final rule that preserves the legal isolation treatment applicable under the existing FDIC rule for asset backed securities issued on or prior to March 31, 2010, which is the date that TALF expires. Issuances after this date are subject to the final determination of the FDIC regarding the legal isolation standard, the potential framework of which was described in the FDICs Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in December 2009. The form that this rule will ultimately take is uncertain at this time, but it may impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future. FDIC Rule Regarding Assessments Market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result, we may be required to pay significantly increased premiums or additional special assessments. In 2009, we paid $15.8 million for a special industry wide FDIC deposit insurance assessment. The FDIC has finalized a proposal that requires banks to prepay their FDIC insurance premiums for the years 2010 through 2012. On December 30, 2009, we prepaid $185.5 million, which includes all of our quarterly assessments, typically paid one quarter in arrears, for the calendar quarters ending December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2012. Additionally, in January 2010, the FDIC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on ways that the FDICs risk based deposit insurance assessment system could be changed to account for the risks posed by certain employee compensation programs. * * * The remaining discussion provides a summary of our results of operations for the years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, as well as our financial condition at November 30, 2009 and 2008. All information and comparisons are based solely on continuing operations. 55 Table of Contents Segments We manage our business activities in two segments: Direct Banking, formerly referred to as U.S. Card, and Payment Services, formerly referred to as Third Party Payments. We have changed the names of our segments to better reflect the nature of the products and services included in our segments. The composition of each segment, however, has not changed. In compiling the segment results that follow, our Direct Banking segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by our Payment Services segment. Direct Banking. Our Direct Banking segment includes Discover card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including personal loans, student loans, prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary. Payment Services. Our Payment Services segment includes the PULSE Network (PULSE), an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and our third party issuing business, which includes credit, debit and prepaid cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties.

Direct Banking Our Direct Banking segment, formerly referred to as our U.S. Card segment, reported pretax income of $2.0 billion for the year ended November 30, 2009, up 28% from the year ended November 30, 2008. The increase was driven principally by income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, higher net interest income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses. Net interest income increased $625.9 million, or 15%, due to the impact of higher interest rates on standard balances, a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances and lower interest rates on borrowings, partially offset by higher interest charge offs. Provision for loan losses increased $1.3 billion, or 42%, as a result of higher charge offs and a higher reserve rate, reflective of the current economic environment. Other income increased $0.9 billion mainly due to revenue related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement. Other expense decreased $198.0 million, or 9%, reflecting the impact of cost containment initiatives such as a reduction of headcount, lower marketing and lower litigation expenses. The 2008 other expenses included a $38.9 million benefit due to curtailment of the companys pension plan. Managed loans of $50.9 billion at November 30, 2009 were relatively unchanged from November 30, 2008 as lower payments from our credit card customers and growth in both student and personal loans were largely offset by lower balance transfer activity and sales volume. Rising unemployment and bankruptcy levels adversely impacted customer delinquencies and charge offs, resulting in a 5.31% managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non credit card loans, up from 4.56% at November 30, 2008. For the year ended November 30, 2009, the managed segment and credit card net charge off rates were 7.77% and 8.00%, respectively, up 276 basis points and 293 basis points, respectively, from the year ended November 30, 2008. Our Direct Banking segment reported pretax income of $1.6 billion for the year ended November 30, 2008, up $87.4 million, or 6%, as compared to November 30, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven principally by payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses. Net interest income increased $550.6 million, or 15%, as higher average loan receivables and the accretion of balance transfer fees, previously recorded in loan fee income, 57 Table of Contents resulted in higher interest income. Net interest income also benefited from lower interest expense driven by a lower cost of funds, which was partially offset by higher borrowings to fund higher loan receivables, higher interest charge offs and lower investment income. Provision for loan losses increased $1.2 billion, or 66%, as a result of higher net charge offs and a higher reserve rate, each of which reflected the deterioration in economic conditions and delinquency trends, as well as owned loan growth due to maturing securitizations. Other income increased $672.8 million, or 32%, due to the payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and an increase in discount and interchange revenue. These were partially offset by a $119.3 million write down of the interest only strip receivable and the inclusion of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008. Other expenses decreased $79.2 million, or 3%, primarily due to a $38.9 million benefit from our pension curtailment, a lower level of marketing for new account acquisition and promotional activity, and a decrease in costs related to litigation. The managed loan balance of $51.1 billion at November 30, 2008 was up 6% from November 30, 2007. This increase in loans was attributable to lower customer payments, growth in personal and student loans during the year and a slight increase in credit card volume, up 2% in 2008, largely due to higher gasoline prices. This increase was partially offset by lower balance transfer activity in 2008. The weakening economic environment adversely impacted customer delinquencies and charge offs. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non credit card loans, was 4.56% at November 30, 2008, 98 basis points higher than the comparable prior year. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge off rates were 5.01% and 5.07%, up 118 and 123 basis points from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Our loan growth combined with the deterioration in the credit environment led to a $614.7 million increase to our reserves over and above our net charge offs for the year ended November 30, 2008. Payment Services Revenues, expenses, pretax income and transaction volumes in our Payment Services segment, formerly referred to as our Third Party Payments segment, grew significantly in 2009 from 2008. 2009 volumes benefited from the inclusion of Diners Club transaction volume for the full year in addition to higher activity from new and existing financial institutions on the PULSE Network. These were partially offset by the loss of volume from one large financial institution along with lower third party issuer volume as a result of lower gasoline prices and lower overall spending. Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $106.5 million for the year ended November 30, 2009, up $25.1 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. Revenues were up $60.6 million mainly driven by increased transactions on the PULSE Network, along with lower incentive payments and higher fee revenue. Expenses were also up $33.3 million including a higher level of international marketing investments, partially offset by the impact of cost containment initiatives. Additionally, the increase in both revenues and expenses during 2009 is due to the inclusion of Diners Club for the full year. Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $81.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2008, up $44.5 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. Revenue increased as a result of a record $125.1 billion in segment transaction volume, up 36% from 2007, and higher fee revenues. Additionally, in 2008, Diners Club contributed $12.7 billion of transaction volume, $27.7 million of revenues and $10.7 million of pretax income. GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our GAAP statements of financial condition. Instances in which a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Bank acquires certificated beneficial interests in securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the acquired beneficial interest and a corresponding increase in investment securities. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our GAAP statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. The managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions; however, there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed. Specifically, these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in certain transactions and payments made by our credit card 58 Table of Contents customers which are allocated to the securitized loans, both of which are held at the trusts. These assets also include the interest only strip receivable, which reflects the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests. Income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts, changes in the fair value of the interest only strip receivable, and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation. Managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitizations. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically have lower charge offs and delinquencies and carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new credit card customers, though such offers have been substantially reduced in recent periods. 59 Table of Contents Financial measures using managed data are non GAAP financial measures. Beginning with Earnings Summary, the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition is on a GAAP basis. The following table provides a reconciliation of the loan receivables and related statistics that are impacted by asset securitization, and which are shown on a managed basis in this annual report, to the most directly comparable GAAP basis financial measure: Reconciliation of GAAP to Managed Data For the Years Ended November 30, 2009 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Loan Receivables Total Loans GAAP Basis $ 23,625,084 $ 25,216,611 $ 20,831,117 Securitization Adjustment 27,235,288 25,878,667 27,349,319 Managed Basis $ 50,860,372 $ 51,095,278 $ 48,180,436 Average Total Loans GAAP Basis $ 26,552,574 $ 21,348,493 $ 19,947,784 Securitization Adjustment 24,588,040 27,662,655 26,965,690 Managed Basis $ 51,140,614 $ 49,011,148 $ 46,913,474 Interest Yield GAAP Basis 11.31 % 10.89 % 10.73 % Securitization Adjustment 13.49 % 13.93 % 14.07 % Managed Basis 12.36 % 12.61 % 12.65 % Net Principal Charge off Rate GAAP Basis 7.45 % 4.59 % 3.40 % Securitization Adjustment 8.12 % 5.32 % 4.15 % Managed Basis 7.77 % 5.01 % 3.83 % Delinquency Rate (over 30 days) GAAP Basis 4.92 % 4.35 % 3.26 % Securitization Adjustment 5.65 % 4.77 % 3.82 % Managed Basis 5.31 % 4.56 % 3.58 % Delinquency Rate (over 90 days) GAAP Basis 2.58 % 2.06 % 1.51 % Securitization Adjustment 2.95 % 2.27 % 1.79 % Managed Basis 2.78 % 2.17 % 1.67 % Credit Card Loans GAAP Basis $ 20,230,302 $ 23,814,307 $ 20,579,923 Securitization Adjustment 27,235,288 25,878,667 27,349,319 Managed Basis $ 47,465,590 $ 49,692,974 $ 47,929,242 Average Credit Card Loans GAAP Basis $ 24,266,782 $ 20,566,864 $ 19,845,880 Securitization Adjustment 24,588,040 27,662,655 26,965,690 Managed Basis $ 48,854,822 $ 48,229,519 $ 46,811,570 Interest Yield GAAP Basis 11.69 % 10.92 % 10.75 % Securitization Adjustment 13.49 % 13.93 % 14.07 % Managed Basis 12.59 % 12.65 % 12.66 % Net Principal Charge off Rate GAAP Basis 7.87 % 4.73 % 3.41 % Securitization Adjustment 8.12 % 5.32 % 4.15 % Managed Basis 8.00 % 5.07 % 3.84 % Delinquency Rate (over 30 days) GAAP Basis 5.52 % 4.55 % 3.28 % Securitization Adjustment 5.65 % 4.77 % 3.82 % Managed Basis 5.60 % 4.66 % 3.59 % Delinquency Rate (over 90 days) GAAP Basis 2.92 % 2.16 % 1.53 % Securitization Adjustment 2.95 % 2.27 % 1.79 % Managed Basis 2.94 % 2.22 % 1.68 % 60 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses, our interest only strip receivable, the valuation of certain certificated retained interests in Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT), the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable net loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management evaluates the allowance monthly for adequacy. The allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses. In estimating losses inherent in the credit card loan portfolio, we use an approach that utilizes a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables. A migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in loan receivables. In determining the proper level of the allowance for loan losses, management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience, including current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. If management used different assumptions in estimating probable losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in managements estimate of probable net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $176 million in the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2009, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. See Note 5: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements for further details about the allowance for loan losses. Accounting for Asset Securitization Transactions We account for our securitization transactions in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 860, Transfers of Financial Assets. The gain on a securitization transaction depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of the transfer. The interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive interest and certain loan fee revenues less certain costs, including loan losses on securitized loans and the contractual rate of interest paid to third party investors in the securitization as well as a servicing fee from the trust over the life of the asset sold. In the absence of observable market prices, the fair value of the interest only strip receivable is estimated based on the present value of expected future cash flows using managements best estimate of the key assumptions, including forecasted interest yield, loan losses and payment rates, the interest paid to investors and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. Changes in the estimated fair value of the interest only strip receivable, as well as certain other retained interests, are recorded in securitization income. If management used different assumptions in estimating the value of the interest only strip receivable, the impact could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in the excess spread assumption for all securitized loans could have resulted in a change of approximately $8 million in the value of the interest only strip receivable as of November 30, 2009. However, as described in Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations, pursuant to new FASB guidance related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation, the securitized loans will be consolidated in the Companys financial statements effective December 1, 2009, at which time the entire value of the interest only strip receivable will be derecognized. See Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the accounting for securitizations. 61 Table of Contents Valuation of Certificated Retained Interests in DCENT Classified as Available for Sale Investment Securities Certain of the subordinated beneficial interests we retain in our securitized assets, including Class B and Class C notes issued by DCENT, are classified as available for sale investment securities and are carried on our consolidated statement of financial condition at their estimated fair values. Changes in the fair values of these notes are recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. The fair values of these securities are estimated utilizing discounted cash flow models, where the interest and principal payments are discounted at assumed current market rates for the same or comparable transactions. In performing these valuations, management makes certain assumptions about the credit spreads and liquidity risk premiums that market participants would demand on the same or similar investments given the current market for credit card asset backed securities. If management used different assumptions in calculating the weighted average discount rate, the change could have a significant impact on our statement of financial condition and equity. For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate could have resulted in a $14 million change in the value of the Class B and Class C notes classified as available for sale investment securities as of November 30, 2009. However, as described in Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations, pursuant to new FASB guidance related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation, our securitized loans will be consolidated in the Companys financial statements effective December 1, 2009, at which time our certificated retained interests in DCENT will be eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4: Investment Securities, Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities and Note 24: Fair Value Disclosures to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion about the accounting for our certificated retained interests in DCENT. Customer Rewards Cost We offer our customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customers purchases. The liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition. We compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity. The liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. We estimate forfeitures based on historical account closure and charge off experience, actual customer purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs. We recognize reward costs for both owned loans and securitized loans as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income. If management used a different estimate of forfeitures, our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed significantly. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of November 30, 2009, could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $9 million. The corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue. See Other Income and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about credit card rewards cost. Goodwill and Other Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the fair values of the acquired net assets. In addition, we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the Diners Club business. As required by GAAP, we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the business unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. Because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses. Similarly, in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models. In applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. We may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. The valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. If the assumptions used by management in these valuations are inappropriate, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when realized, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. 62 Table of Contents Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the United States, its states and municipalities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. Changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. When such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant. See Note 19: Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes.

Net interest margin represents interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest earning assets on an annualized basis. Our interest earning assets consist of: (i) loan receivables, (ii) our liquidity reserve which includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve, highly rated certificates of deposit, and triple A rated government mutual funds, (iii) certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization, and (iv) investment securities. Interest earning assets do not include investors interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties. Similarly, interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans. Our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both brokered and direct to consumer. Net interest income is influenced by the following: The level and composition of interest earning assets and liabilities, including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and the percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices, such as the prime rate and federal funds rate; Credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges which reduce interest income; and The terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate. 63 Table of Contents For the Year Ended November 30, 2009 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2008 For the year ended November 30, 2009, net interest income grew $489.2 million, or 35%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. During the same periods, our net interest margin and interest rate spread increased to 4.74% and 3.90%, respectively, up from 4.20% and 3.40%, respectively. A higher average level of on balance sheet loans was the largest factor driving the increased net interest income, which, along with other factors, is discussed below. The higher average level of on balance sheet loans at November 30, 2009 compared to November 30, 2008, was due to retaining more loan receivables on balance sheet throughout 2009 as securitized receivables matured; however, our ending loan receivable balance declined from 2008 to 2009 as we had securitization transactions in the later half of 2009 resulting in a lower level of on balance sheet loan receivables at year end. Interest income on credit card loans grew $590.0 million from the year ended November 30, 2008 as a result of retaining more loan receivables on balance sheet as securitized receivables matured, as well as an increase in the interest yield of 77 basis points. The increase in yield was the result of higher interest rates on standard balances and a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances. This was partially offset by higher interest charge offs due to the deterioration in the current economic environment as well as a higher average level of on balance sheet loans. Interest income on other consumer loans increased $88.8 million from 2008 reflecting growth in both personal and student loans partially offset by a 283 basis point decrease in interest yield. The yield decreased as the proportion of student loans, which bear lower interest rates than personal loans, as a component of total other consumer loans increased. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other assets decreased $247.6 million from 2008 reflecting the unfavorable impact of the lower interest rate environment on our liquidity reserve and amounts due from asset securitization. The changes in interest expense had a minimal impact on net interest income as lower cost of funds was largely offset by a higher level of deposit funding. Beginning in the second half of 2008, we increased our deposit issuance in order to fund more loan receivables on balance sheet as a result of securitization maturities. Since that time, benchmark interest rates have declined, also driving down deposit rates. These lower deposit rates contributed to a 59 basis point decline in the cost of deposit funding in 2009 compared to 2008. For the Year Ended November 30, 2008 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2007 For the year ended November 30, 2008, net interest income grew $43.4 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. During the same periods, our net interest margin and interest rate spread decreased to 4.20% and 3.40%, respectively, down from 4.82% and 3.87%, respectively. Interest income on credit card loans grew $111.5 million from the year ended November 30, 2007, as a result of retaining more loan receivables on balance sheet as securitized receivables matured, in addition to a 17 basis point increase in interest yield. This increase in yield was driven by the inclusion of $70.1 million of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008. This was partially offset by rising interest charge offs due to the deterioration in the economic environment as well as a higher level of on balance sheet loans. Interest income on other consumer loans increased $73.3 million from the year ended November 30, 2007 reflecting growth in both personal and student loans, in addition to a 388 basis point increase in interest yield. The yield increased due to higher rates on newly issued personal loans. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents and other assets decreased $117.5 million from the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the lower interest rate environment on our liquidity reserve and amounts due from asset securitization. Interest expense increased $64.7 million, or 5%, largely due to our higher average funding levels in 2008, partially offset by a 61 basis point decrease to 4.66% in our cost of funds for the year ended November 30, 2008 as a result of the lower interest rate environment, and the repayment of short term borrowings due to our former parent company prior to our spin off. 64 Table of Contents The following tables provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes for the years ended November 30 (dollars in thousands): Average Balance Sheet Analysis 2009 2008 2007 AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest Assets Interest earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,854,380 0.56 % $ 50,024 $ 8,374,905 2.64 % $ 220,744 $ 4,883,291 5.09 % $ 248,788 Other short term investments 662,979 0.59 % 3,883 Investment securities 1,581,387 4.34 % 68,694 916,307 5.60 % 51,345 199,075 5.28 % 10,502 Loan receivables:(1) Credit card(2) 24,266,782 11.69 % 2,835,767 20,566,864 10.92 % 2,245,719 19,845,880 10.75 % 2,134,188 Other 2,285,792 7.37 % 168,517 781,629 10.20 % 79,695 101,904 6.32 % 6,442 Total loan receivables 26,552,574 11.31 % 3,004,284 21,348,493 10.89 % 2,325,414 19,947,784 10.73 % 2,140,630 Other interest earning assets 2,338,438 0.78 % 18,195 2,770,260 3.43 % 95,060 3,237,581 5.70 % 184,482 Total interest earning assets 39,989,758 7.86 % 3,145,080 33,409,965 8.06 % 2,692,563 28,267,731 9.14 % 2,584,402 Allowance for loan losses (1,808,493 ) (887,668 ) (658,783 ) Other assets 4,053,270 2,960,496 2,512,889 Assets from discontinued operations 1,321,595 3,802,047 Total assets $ 42,234,535 $ 36,804,388 $ 33,923,884 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits: Time deposits(3) $ 24,748,485 4.52 % 1,117,396 $ 21,208,003 5.01 % 1,062,741 $ 16,423,343 5.19 % 851,988 Money market deposits 4,091,867 1.58 % 64,555 4,439,434 3.07 % 136,271 3,662,961 5.22 % 191,389 Other interest bearing deposits 283,238 1.81 % 5,133 40,337 1.05 % 424 36,748 3.26 % 1,197 Total interest bearing deposits 29,123,590 4.08 % 1,187,084 25,687,774 4.67 % 1,199,436 20,123,052 5.19 % 1,044,574 Borrowings: Short term borrowings 837,452 0.30 % 2,538 37,660 0.91 % 343 1,629,810 5.48 % 89,319 Long term borrowings 1,648,735 3.74 % 61,662 1,919,147 4.60 % 88,225 1,459,114 6.13 % 89,377 Total borrowings 2,486,187 2.58 % 64,200 1,956,807 4.53 % 88,568 3,088,924 5.79 % 178,696 Total interest bearing liabilities 31,609,777 3.96 % 1,251,284 27,644,581 4.66 % 1,288,004 23,211,976 5.27 % 1,223,270 Other liabilities and stockholders equity Liabilities of discontinued operations 968,406 2,806,564 Other liabilities and stockholders equity 10,624,758 8,191,401 7,905,344 Total other liabilities and stockholders equity 10,624,758 9,159,807 10,711,908 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 42,234,535 $ 36,804,388 $ 33,923,884 Net interest income $ 1,893,796 $ 1,404,559 $ 1,361,132 Net interest margin(4) 4.74 % 4.20 % 4.82 % Interest rate spread(5) 3.90 % 3.40 % 3.87 % (1) Average balances of loan receivables include non accruing loans and these loans are therefore included in the yield calculations.

See Note 6: Credit Card Securitization Activities to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 66 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include: The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; Changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors; Changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio; The level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs; The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts; and Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. In calculating the allowance for loan losses, we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics. For our credit card loans, we use a migration analysis to determine the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through various stages of delinquency to charge off. An estimated charge off ratio is then applied to each delinquency category to derive an estimated reserve rate. To determine if any adjustments should be made to the reserve rate derived from the migration analysis, we consider current economic trends as well as the difference between actual charge offs and what was estimated to be charged off in recent periods. For our other consumer loans, we consider historical and forecasted losses in estimating the related allowance for loan losses. For the year ended November 30, 2009, the provision for loan losses increased $766.8 million, or 48%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2008, reflecting higher net charge offs and an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses. Higher net charge offs are a result of the deterioration in the current economic environment, and are discussed further in Net Charge offs and Delinquencies below. At November 30, 2009, the allowance for loan losses was $1.8 billion, an increase of $383.3 million from November 30, 2008. This increase reflects a reserve addition related to a 199 basis point increase to the reserve rate, partially offset by a $1.6 billion decline in on balance sheet loans at November 30, 2009. For the year ended November 30, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $861.7 million, or 117%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge offs. In the year ended November 30, 2008, we added $614.7 million to the allowance for loan losses to bring the total allowance to $1.4 billion, an increase of 81% over November 30, 2007. This increase in the allowance reflects an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to rising delinquency and charge off rates and loan growth, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008 as we retained more loan receivables from maturing securitizations on our balance sheet in response to the inability to re securitize the receivables as a result of the disruption in the securitization markets at that time.

Charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies and probate accounts. Customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day contractual time frame. The net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period.

The net charge off rate has steadily increased since the fourth quarter of 2008, reflecting the weakening economic environment as a result of rising unemployment, an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs and the decrease in the availability of consumer credit. Additionally, personal loans, which are included in other consumer loans, grew significantly in 2008 and into 2009, have seasoned and have started to experience charge offs. Delinquencies Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. Loan receivables are placed on non accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a customer, suspected fraudulent activity on an account, as part of certain collection management processes, and other instances in which management feels collectability is not assured. In some cases of suspected fraudulent activity, loan receivables may resume accruing interest upon completion of the fraud investigation. The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days past due, loan receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands): At November 30, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Loans over 30 days delinquent $ 1,161,497 4.92 % $ 1,096,627 4.35 % $ 679,306 3.26 % $ 633,150 3.05 % $ 756,198 3.67 % Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest $ 522,190 2.21 % $ 444,324 1.76 % $ 271,227 1.30 % $ 244,675 1.18 % $ 263,439 1.28 % Loans not accruing interest $ 190,086 0.80 % $ 173,123 0.69 % $ 102,286 0.49 % $ 110,625 0.53 % $ 215,671 1.05 % The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 57 basis points and 45 basis points, respectively at November 30, 2009, as compared to November 30. 2008. The increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our customers ability to pay their loan balances. Delinquency rates normally rise as charge offs rise, however, since the third quarter 2008, we have been experiencing a pattern of charge offs rising faster than delinquencies. This pattern is the result of having a higher proportion of balances move from delinquent status to charge off than in historical periods. The movement from delinquent status to charge off has increased as more customers are unable to become current on their past due accounts and as more customers declare bankruptcy. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2009 increased 11 basis points to 0.80%, as compared to November 30, 2008, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications. The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 109 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively, at November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. This increase in both measures reflected of the weaker economic environment on our customers ability to pay their loan balances. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2008 increased 20 basis points to 0.69%, as compared to November 30, 2007, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications. 69 Table of Contents Maturities and Sensitivities of Loan Receivables to Changes in Interest Rates Our loan receivables had the following maturity distribution(1) at November 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Due OneYear orLess Due AfterOne YearThroughFive Years Due AfterFive Years Total Credit card loans $ 4,854,184 $ 10,235,498 $ 5,140,620 $ 20,230,302 Other consumer loans 2,174 869,912 2,522,696 3,394,782 Total loan receivables $ 4,856,358 $ 11,105,410 $ 7,663,316 $ 23,625,084 (1) Because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments. Historically, actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments, and therefore, the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments. At November 30, 2009, approximately $9.9 billion of our loan receivables due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $8.9 billion were fixed rate loans. Other Income The principal component of other income is securitization income.

Total other income increased $576.1 million, or 14%, for the year ended November 30, 2009, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008, primarily as a result of $1.0 billion of higher income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, partially offset by lower securitization income. For the year ended November 30, 2008, total other income increased $887.8 million, or 26%, as compared to November 30, 2007, primarily as a result of an $862.5 million payment from MasterCard for its portion of the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and higher securitization income, partially offset by a decline in loan fee income. These key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below. Securitization Income Through November 30, 2009, the issuance of asset backed securities to investors, referred to as securitization, has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from our consolidated statements of financial condition. Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through the securitization and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card loan receivables we originate. Also, portions of net interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our residual interests in those transactions. We allocate the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue and, in recent years, merchant discount and interchange revenue earned on securitized loans (see 70 Table of Contents further discussion of merchant discount and interchange revenue below) to investors in securitizations. These cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows, referred to as excess spread, are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests. Beginning December 1, 2009, our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income, but will instead report interest income, net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt. Additionally, we will no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans will no longer receive sale accounting treatment, nor will there be any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing and, accordingly, will be derecognized on December 1, 2009. For more information, see Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations. The table below presents the components of securitization income (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease) 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2009 2008 2007 $ % $ % Excess spread $ 1,570,005 $ 2,017,146 $ 1,753,844 $ (447,141 ) (22 %) $ 263,302 15 % Servicing fees on securitized loans 492,095 553,398 538,409 (61,303 ) (11 %) 14,989 3 % Net revaluation of retained interests(1) (160,087 ) (119,324 ) 51,346 (40,763 ) (34 %) (170,670 ) NM Other (principally transaction costs) (22,709 ) (22,062 ) (19,976 ) (647 ) (3 %) (2,086 ) (10 %) Total securitization income $ 1,879,304 $ 2,429,158 $ 2,323,623 $ (549,854 ) (23 %) $ 105,535 5 % (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable. Securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans. Average securitized loans of $24.6 billion for the year ended November 30, 2009, was significantly lower than the $27.7 billion and $27.0 billion average levels of securitized loans at November 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a result of the disruption in the credit card asset backed securitization markets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into 2009. For the year ended November 30, 2009, securitization income decreased $549.9 million, or 23%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower excess spread on securitized loans along with lower servicing fees earned and a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests. In 2008, securitization income increased $105.5 million, or 5%, as compared to 2007 primarily reflecting higher excess spread on securitized loans offset in part by a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests. These variances, as well as other factors, are described in more detail in the tables and discussion below. 71 Table of Contents Excess spread. The following table provides the components of excess spread (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease) 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2009 2008 2007 $ % $ % Interest income on securitized loans $ 3,315,992 $ 3,853,266 $ 3,794,272 $ (537,274 ) (14 %) $ 58,994 2 % Interest paid to investors in asset backed securities (397,136 ) (1,068,915 ) (1,517,858 ) 671,779 63 % 448,943 30 % Net interest income 2,918,856 2,784,351 2,276,414 134,505 5 % 507,937 22 % Other fee revenue on securitized loans(1) 1,139,180 1,259,182 1,135,347 (120,002 ) (10 %) 123,835 11 % Net charge offs on securitized loans (1,995,936 ) (1,472,989 ) (1,119,508 ) (522,947 ) (36 %) (353,481 ) (32 %) Net revenues on securitized loans 2,062,100 2,570,544 2,292,253 (508,444 ) (20 %) 278,291 12 % Servicing fees on securitized loans (492,095 ) (553,398 ) (538,409 ) 61,303 11 % (14,989 ) (3 %) Excess spread $ 1,570,005 $ 2,017,146 $ 1,753,844 $ (447,141 ) (22 %) $ 263,302 15 % (1) Other fee income includes discount and interchange revenue, loan fee income and fee products revenue. For the year ended November 30, 2009, excess spread on securitized loans decreased $447.1 million, or 22%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. The decrease was mainly due to higher net charge offs and lower other fee revenue on securitized loans partially offset by higher net interest income. Higher net charge offs were reflective of the current economic environment. Lower other fee revenue was attributable to a lower level of securitized loans. The increase in net interest income was due to a decrease in the interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average LIBOR on floating rate investor interests, partially offset by lower interest income earned on securitized loans as a result of the lower level of securitized loans. For the year ended November 30, 2008, excess spread on securitized loans increased $263.3 million, or 15%, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. The increase was attributable to higher net interest income and higher other fee revenue on securitized loans offset in part by higher net charge offs. The increase in net interest income related largely to a decrease in interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average LIBOR on floating rate investor interests, offset in part by wider spreads paid to investors on new transactions. Higher other fee revenue was attributable to the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. The higher net charge offs were reflective of the weakening economic and credit environment. Servicing fees on securitized loans. Servicing fees are paid to the Company for servicing the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements and are largely dependent on the level of securitized loans. We are paid a servicing fee from the cash flows generated by the securitized loans, which include interest income and loan fee income and, effective with trust actions taken in July 2009, discount and interchange revenue for all securitized loans. In 2009, servicing fees decreased as compared to 2008 by $61.3 million, or 11%, as a result of a lower level of securitized loans, while servicing fees increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 by $15.0 million, or 3%, due to a higher level of securitized loans. Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease) 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2009 2008 2007 $ $ Initial gain on new securitization transactions(1) $ 16,707 $ 71,872 $ 122,949 $ (55,165 ) $ (51,077 ) Revaluation of retained interests (176,794 ) (191,196 ) (71,603 ) 14,402 (119,593 ) Net revaluation of retained interests $ (160,087 ) $ (119,324 ) $ 51,346 $ (40,763 ) $ (170,670 ) (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable. 72 Table of Contents The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2009 decreased $40.8 million, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. The decrease included $55.2 million lower initial gains on a lower level of securitization activity ($3.6 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2009 as compared to $5.6 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2008). The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests of $176.8 million for the year ended November 30, 2009 was largely related to changes in the assumptions used to value the interest only strip receivable as compared to the previous period, including lower projected excess spread. The lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge offs partially offset by a higher expected net interest spread reflective of repricing actions taken during 2009. This was partially offset by a gain in our cash collateral account as compared to a loss in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the remaining life of our cash collateral accounts. The net revaluation of retained interests for the year ended November 30, 2008 decreased $170.7 million, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007. The decrease included $51.1 million lower initial gains on a lower level of securitization activity ($5.6 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to $8.5 billion of new third party securitization transactions for the year ended November 30, 2007) and lower projected excess spread on new securitizations as a result of higher charge offs. The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests of $191.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2008 largely related to unfavorable changes in assumptions used to value the interest only strip receivable as compared to the previous period end, including lower projected excess spread. The lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge offs, higher interest rate projections and widening spreads on new securitizations as a result of trends in the securitization markets. Loan Fee Income Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, over limit, cash advance, pay by phone and other miscellaneous fees, although, beginning in February 2010, we will no longer charge over limit or pay by phone fees as a result of changes made in connection with the CARD Act. Loan fee income decreased $15.3 million, or 6%, for the year ended November 30, 2009, as compared to November 30, 2008 as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees and higher charge offs and adjustments of loan fees, partially offset by an increase in income from late fees. Loan fee income decreased $75.5 million, or 22%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007, as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees. Beginning in mid 2008, balance transfer fees, historically accounted for in loan fee income, were deferred and accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. Discount and Interchange Revenue Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. We earn acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by credit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organizations transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain customers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customers purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. Discount and interchange revenue increased $35.2 million, or 19%, for the year ended November 30, 2009, compared to November 30, 2008, due to lower customer rewards costs, partially offset by lower revenues earned on a lower level of owned loans. Lower customer rewards costs were due to a decline in sales volume, partially offset by adjustments made in the third quarter of 2008 to the rewards liability for an increase in expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $53.4 million, or 22% for the year ended November 30, 2008, compared to November 30, 2007, due to higher allocations to securitized loans, partially offset by lower customer rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of average outstanding securitized loans receiving such allocations in the 2008 compared to 2007. 73 Table of Contents Fee Products We earn revenue related to fees received for selling ancillary products and services including debt deferment/debt cancellation and identity theft protection services to customers. The amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customers outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized over the agreement or contract period as earned. Fee products income increased $45.3 million, or 18%, and $35.2 million, or 16%, for the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as compared to the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, primarily related to an increase in the number of customers that purchased these products and services as well as higher balances upon which the fees are based. Merchant Fees To broaden merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards, we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late 2006. In addition, we have sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and to reduce costs. As we move away from direct merchant relationships, our merchant fee income and related costs will decline. The lower cost per transaction is generally expected to be offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance. Gains on the sale of merchant acquiring portfolios are reflected in other income as earned. Merchant fees consist primarily of fees charged to merchants for various services including manual authorization of transactions and delivery of hardcopy statements. For the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, merchant fees decreased $22.8 million, or 34%, and $25.5 million, or 28%, as compared to the years November 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in both periods is due to increased outsourcing to merchant acquirers. As merchant acquiring portfolios are sold to third party merchant acquirers, this revenue will decrease along with associated costs. Transaction Processing Revenue Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing ATM, debit and point of sale transactions over the PULSE Network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. Transaction processing revenue increased $9.3 million, or 8%, and $16.3 million, or 16%, for the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as compared to the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007, primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by pricing incentives offered to financial institutions, which are accounted for as an offset to revenue. Loss on Investment Securities Loss on investment securities includes realized gains and losses on the sale of investments as well as any write downs of investment securities to fair value when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary. During the year ended November 30, 2009, we recorded an $8.2 million write down of the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC, which invested in mortgage backed securities, partially offset by $5.4 million of income related to other asset backed securities held as available for sale investment securities that were sold during the year. For the years ended November 30, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded other than temporary impairment in our investment in the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC, of $8.2 million, $49.1 million and $11.4 million, respectively. The loss on investment securities for 2008 and 2007 was mainly comprised of the other than temporary impairment recorded for these notes. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded an unrealized gain of $7.5 million related to these notes through other comprehensive income. See additional information on other than temporary impairments recorded in our consolidated statements of income in Note 4: Investment Securities. Antitrust Litigation Settlement Amounts received in conjunction with the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, including related interest, are recorded in this line item when earned. We received $1.9 billion in 2009 from Visa as payment for its portion of the settlement and a total of $4.2 million in related interest income. In 2008, we received $0.9 billion from MasterCard as payment for its portion of the settlement. See additional information in Liquidity and Capital Resources Special Dividend and Settlement of Visa and MasterCard Antitrust Litigation. We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin off to give us sole control over the investigation, prosecution and resolution of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. The matter is a subject of litigation between the parties. See Legal Proceedings for additional background and recent developments related to this litigation. 74 Table of Contents Other Income Other income includes revenues from the sale of merchant portfolios to third party acquirers, royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income was relatively flat for the year ended November 30, 2009 compared to November 30, 2008 despite the inclusion of Diners Club revenue for a full year, which was largely offset by lower gains on sales of merchant portfolios and lower revenues from the referral of declined applications to third party issuers. Other income increased $60.4 million in 2008, primarily due to the inclusion of Diners Club revenue and reporting an unrealized gain on interest rate swap agreements for the year ended November 30, 2008 compared to an unrealized loss for the year ended November 30, 2007. These increases were partially offset by lower gains from sales of merchant portfolios. Other Expense The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease) 2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease) 2009 2008 2007 $ % $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 827,683 $ 845,392 $ 850,065 $ (17,709 ) (2 %) $ (4,673 ) (1 %) Marketing and business development 406,020 530,901 576,263 (124,881 ) (24 %) (45,362 ) (8 %) Information processing and communications 289,209 315,943 330,053 (26,734 ) (8 %) (14,110 ) (4 %) Professional fees 321,329 349,484 361,409 (28,155 ) (8 %) (11,925 ) (3 %) Premises and equipment 73,014 80,394 79,442 (7,380 ) (9 %) 952 1 % Other expense 333,833 293,683 280,982 40,150 14 % 12,701 5 % Total other expense $ 2,251,088 $ 2,415,797 $ 2,478,214 $ (164,709 ) (7 %) $ (62,417 ) (3 %) Total other expense decreased $164.7 million, or 7%, for the year ended November 30, 2009, as compared to November 30, 2008. Expenses were lower overall reflecting the impact of cost containment initiatives. Marketing fees decreased $124.9 million, or 24%, mainly due to a reduction in new account acquisition, which included reductions in postage, supplies and credit bureau fees. Other expense increased $40.2 million, or 14%, due to the inclusion of a full year of Diners Club expenses compared to only six months in 2008, a one time expense related to a reduction in force, other expenses related to the Morgan Stanley special dividend, increased costs associated with the global expansion initiative and a charge related to a facility closure, partially offset by lower fraud costs. Total other expense decreased $62.4 million, or 3%, for the year ended November 30, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. The decrease was primarily driven by lower marketing expenditures, lower information processing and communications and lower professional fees, partially offset by the inclusion of Diners Club expenses. Marketing fees decreased $45.4 million, or 8% in the same period due to lower direct marketing activity partially offset by increased internet and television advertising. Information processing and communications fees declined due to lower depreciation expense as certain assets became fully depreciated in 2008. Professional fees decreased $11.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to lower legal fees relating to lower general, regulatory and routine advisory legal fees partially offset by an increase in collection fees. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased due to a pension credit as a result of the announcement of the freezing of benefit accruals under the pension plans in 2008 partially offset by higher compensation costs. 75 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense For the Years EndedNovember 30, 2009 2008 2007 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits 4.1 2.5 2.2 Federal examinations and settlements State examinations and settlements (0.9 ) (0.1 ) Valuation allowance capital loss 1.1 Non deductible spin off costs 0.2 Non deductible compensation 0.4 Other (0.8 ) (0.7 ) (0.5 ) Effective income tax rate 39.8 % 35.9 % 36.8 % Income tax expense increased $250.0 million, or 42%, for the year ended November 30, 2009 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008, reflecting an increase in pretax income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate increased 3.9% for the year ended November 30, 2009 from 35.9% for the year ended November 30, 2008 as a result of (i) a higher effective state tax rate due to estimated taxes payable in additional states, (ii) a valuation allowance of $23.7 million which was recorded in 2009 against deferred tax assets largely related to our assessment of the likelihood that the tax benefit of capital losses related to the sale of the Goldfish business in 2008 is no longer realizable; and (iii) tax expense of $9.4 million recorded in 2009 related to non deductible stock based compensation. Income tax expense increased $33.2 million, or 6%, for the year ended November 30, 2008 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2007, reflecting an increase in pretax income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased 0.9% for the year ended November 30, 2008 from 36.8% for the year ended November 30, 2007 as a result of the settlement of certain state examination issues, which resulted in a tax benefit during 2008. Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding and Liquidity We seek to maintain diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and service our maturing obligations. In addition, we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile, to utilize a cost effective mix of both long term and short term funding sources and to ensure the composition of our investor base provides appropriate diversification. Our primary funding sources include deposits, sourced directly or through brokers, term asset backed securitizations, asset backed conduit financing and long term borrowings. During 2009, we raised approximately $15.4 billion through new issuances and renewals of existing deposits, the majority of which were sourced through our direct to consumer deposit channel. We also successfully completed several capital market transactions including $3.6 billion of asset backed securitizations that were eligible for funding through the TALF program and asset backed conduit financing, an offering of $400 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes, an offering of $700 million in principal amount of subordinated notes of Discover Bank and a common stock offering resulting in approximately $534 million in net proceeds to us. Funding Sources Deposits. We offer deposit products, including certificates of deposit, money market accounts, online savings accounts and Individual Retirement Account (IRA) certificates of deposits, to customers through two channels: (i) directly through direct mail, internet origination and affinity relationships (direct to consumer deposits); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with brokerage firms (brokered deposits). During 2009, we significantly expanded our direct to consumer program with such deposits increasing $6.4 billion, or 103%, to $12.6 billion at the end of 2009, and we expect to continue to grow our use of this deposit channel in 2010. 76 Table of Contents The direct to consumer channel provides us with the ability to renew certificates of deposit and to cross sell deposit products to our credit card customers. During the same period, we decreased our brokered deposits by $2.8 billion, or 13%, to $19.5 billion at November 30, 2009. Maturities of our certificates of deposit range from one month to fifteen years, with a weighted average maturity of 26 months at November 30, 2009. The following table summarizes deposits by product and maturities as of November 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Total Three Monthsor Less Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths Over TwelveMonths Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000(1) $ 22,587,898 $ 1,424,998 $ 1,992,770 $ 3,796,138 $ 15,373,992 Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000(1) or greater 4,047,949 390,605 392,870 1,372,232 1,892,242 Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts 5,392,659 5,392,659 Total interest bearing deposits $ 32,028,506 $ 7,208,262 $ 2,385,640 $ 5,168,370 $ 17,266,234 (1) Represents the basic insurance amount covered by the FDIC although, effective May 20, 2009, a higher amount of $250,000 of basic insurance per depositor is in effect through December 31, 2013. As of November 30, 2009, uninsured deposits represented approximately 2.0% of total interest bearing deposits. Securitization Financing. Historically, we have used the securitization of credit card receivables as one of our largest sources of funding, including both the public securitization market and the privately placed asset backed conduit financing market. For much of 2008 and 2009, market events and capital market disruptions had made the securitization market unavailable at volumes and pricing that would be attractive to us. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the launch of the Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset backed securities by offering financing on relatively favorable terms. The TALF program currently extends through March 31, 2010. DCENT issued its first TALF eligible transaction on July 14, 2009 for $1.5 billion with a three year term. DCENT issued a second TALF eligible transaction on September 11, 2009 for $1.3 billion with a three year term. We have capacity to issue up to $9.6 billion in triple A rated asset backed securities from our securitization trusts, the same amount of which is available for issuance on or before March 31, 2010 through the TALF program. The triple A rating of DCENT Class A Notes issued to date has been based, in part, on an FDIC rule which provides that the FDIC will not seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP. Pursuant to FASB guidance related to transfers of financial assets and consolidations, effective December 1, 2009, the transfer of assets made to the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT) and DCENT will no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment. Consequently, there has been uncertainty in the securitization market as to how the FDIC will treat assets transferred into securitization vehicles under the newly effective FASB guidance. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued an Interim Final Rule which preserves the legal isolation treatment applicable under the existing FDIC rule for asset backed securities issued on or before March 31, 2010. The FDIC interim rule has lifted the uncertainty of existing securitizations and both TALF and non TALF issuance on or before March 31, 2010. However, issuances beyond March 31, 2010 are subject to the final determination by the FDIC of the legal isolation standard. On December 15, 2009, the FDIC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which describes a possible framework for legal isolation treatment of asset backed securities issued after March 31, 2010. The form that this rule will ultimately take is uncertain at this time, but it may impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future. At November 30, 2009, we had $19.6 billion of outstanding public asset backed securities, $2.7 billion of outstanding private asset backed conduit financings and $4.6 billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to subsidiaries of the Company. At November 30, 2009, we had $1.5 billion in unused asset backed conduit capacity. 77 Table of Contents The following table summarizes expected maturities of the investors interests in securitizations excluding those that have been issued to subsidiaries of the Company at November 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThreeYears Four YearsThroughFive Years After FiveYears Scheduled maturities of the investors interests in securitizations issued to third parties $ 22,305,269 $ 9,923,686 $ 9,263,160 $ 2,118,423 $ 1,000,000 We access the public asset backed securitization market through DCMT and DCENT, using receivables generated by our credit card business. Through DCMT we have used a structure utilizing Class A and Class B certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates, a cash collateral account and a more subordinated Series 2009 CE certificate described below. DCENT consists of four classes of securities (Class A, B, C and D), with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated classes of notes. As of November 30, 2009, $2.3 billion of Class B and C notes are owned by subsidiaries of Discover Bank. We have completed the following transactions for DCMT and DCENT since mid 2009: In the third quarter of 2009, we issued the DiscoverSeries Class D (2009 1) note from DCENT that added 6.5% credit enhancement to all outstanding notes of the DiscoverSeries and is available to support new issuances of DiscoverSeries notes through increases in the stated principal amount. On November 30, 2009, the stated principal amount of the Class D notes was $829 million, which was approximately 6.5% of the then outstanding notes of DCENT including the Class D notes. In January 2010, we increased the size of the Class D (2009 1) note to further support the more senior DCENT securities. A wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Bank owns the DCENT Class D (2009 1) note. In the third quarter of 2009, we issued Series 2009 CE from DCMT to provide credit enhancement to DCMT investor certificates. This subordinate series supports all outstanding series of DCMT other than Series 2007 CC (which supports the DCENT notes, for which the DiscoverSeries Class D notes were issued). On November 30, 2009, the stated principal amount of this subordinate series was $902 million, which is generally equivalent to 6.5% of the series investor interests, including the subordinate series. DCMT Series 1996 4, which had lower initial levels of credit enhancement, received additional credit enhancement through the subordinate series in an amount bringing its enhancement levels in line with other comparable series of DCMT certificates. In January 2010, we increased the size of Series 2009 CE to further support the more senior DCMT certificates. The DCMT Series 2009 CE investor certificates are owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Bank. In addition, in September 2009 we issued Series 2009 SD from DCMT to enhance excess spread for all outstanding series of investor certificates and tranches of DiscoverSeries notes. Series 2009 SD makes all of its principal collections available for reallocation on an as needed basis to all outstanding series (including the DiscoverSeries) to cover shortfalls in interest and servicing fees and to reimburse charge offs for those other series. The availability of these principal collections increases excess spread levels for DCMT and for the DiscoverSeries notes. The Series 2009 SD interest will remain equal to approximately 2.0% of the total investors interests. The DCMT Series 2009 SD investor certificates are owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Bank. The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the underlying securities, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as economic early amortization, which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, as well as the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from Series 2009 SD, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three month rolling average, we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings over a period of a few months. As of November 30, 2009, no economic early amortization events have occurred. 78 Table of Contents The tables below provide information concerning investors interests and related excess spreads at November 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands): InvestorsInterests(1) # of SeriesOutstanding Discover Card Master Trust I $ 14,134,204 16 Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DiscoverSeries notes) 12,759,358 27 Total investors interests $ 26,893,562 43 (1) Effective July 31, 2009, all DCMT certificates and all notes issued by DCENT include cash flows derived from merchant discount and interchange revenue earned by Discover card. 3 Month RollingAverage ExcessSpread(1)(2) Group excess spread percentage 11.43 % DiscoverSeries excess spread percentage 10.57 % (1) DCMT certificates refer to the higher of the Group excess spreads (as shown above) or their applicable series excess spreads in assessing whether an economic early amortization has occurred.

(2) Discount Series (DCMT 2009 SD), which was issued in September 2009, makes principal collections available for reallocation to other series to cover shortfalls in interest and servicing fees and to reimburse charge offs. Three month rolling average excess spread rates reflected the benefit of these additional collections. As of November 30, 2009, the balance of cash collateral account loans supporting DCMT, which we had funded, was $842.4 million and is recorded in amounts due from asset securitization in our consolidated statement of financial condition at its fair value of $822.6 million. A majority of this funding was obtained through a loan facility entered into between a consolidated special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, and third party lenders. At November 30, 2009, $528.2 million of the DRFC Funding LLC loan facility remains outstanding and is recorded in long term borrowings in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Repayment of this loan facility is secured by $792.4 million of cash collateral account loans at November 30, 2009. This portion of the cash collateral account loans was sold to DRFC Funding LLC and is not expected to be available to creditors of Discover Financial Services. The following table summarizes estimated maturities of the cash collateral accounts at November 30, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years After FiveYears Scheduled maturities of cash collateral accounts $ 842,369 $ 382,895 $ 311,842 $ 147,632 $ Short Term Borrowings. In the past, we have accessed short term borrowings through the Federal Reserves Term Auction Facility, term and overnight Federal Funds purchased, and other short term borrowings with original maturities of less than one year. However, we had no outstanding short term borrowings at November 30, 2009. Long Term Borrowings and Bank Notes. In 2009, we successfully accessed the unsecured debt market. We issued $400 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes in the third quarter of 2009 with a fixed rate of 10.25% that mature in July 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2009, Discover Bank issued $700 million of subordinated notes with a fixed interest rate of 8.70% that mature in November 2019. At November 30, 2009, we had $1.2 billion senior unsecured notes outstanding including $400 million in principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured notes, which mature in June 2010, and two $400 million fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature in June 2017 and July 2019, respectively. At November 30, 2009, we had $700 million in principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding that mature in November 2019. 79 Table of Contents Additional Funding Sources Secured Committed Credit Facilities. We have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through privately placed asset backed conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At November 30, 2009, we had used $2.7 billion of capacity under these conduits, with $1.5 billion remaining capacity available to us. The original commitments of these facilities range from 364 day renewable agreements to multi year extendable commitments. Unsecured Committed Credit Facility. Our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.4 billion is available through May 2012. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank (Discover Financial Services may borrow up to 30% and Discover Bank may borrow up to 100% of the total commitment). We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time. We have no outstanding balances due under the facility. Federal Reserve. Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias discount window. As of November 30, 2009, Discover Bank had $4.8 billion of available capacity through the discount window, which includes $2.4 billion capacity through the Term Auction Facility. Our Federal Reserve available capacity decreased in the fourth quarter of 2009 due to the Federal Reserve decreasing the amount it will lend against certain loans pledged as collateral. ECASLA. In May 2008, Congress passed the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA). ECASLA provides originators of Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans with the ability to transfer qualifying FFELP loans to the Department of Education through participation and loan sale programs and or finance FFELP loans through an asset backed conduit program. ECASLA provides us with a potential source of funding and liquidity with respect to qualifying FFELP loans originated by Discover Bank. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings for Discover Financial Services, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The credit ratings are summarized in the following table: DiscoverFinancialServices DiscoverBank Discover CardMaster Trust I(1) Discover Card ExecutionNote Trust(1) SeniorUnsecuredDebt SeniorUnsecuredDebt Outlook forSeniorUnsecured Debt Class A Class B Class A Class B Class C Moodys Investors Service Ba1 Baa3 Negative Aaa A1 Aaa A1 Baa1 Standard & Poors BBB BBB Stable AAA AA AAA AA A Fitch Ratings BBB BBB Negative AAA AA AAA AA A (1) Ratings are for outstanding issuances of asset backed securities issued by the trusts that mature after May 2010. Liquidity We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations. We expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business activities in the short term and long term through normal access to our funding sources, relying primarily on deposit issuance. In the assessment of our liquidity needs, we also evaluate a range of stress events that would impact our access to normal funding sources, cash needs and or liquidity. We maintain contingent funding sources, including our liquidity reserve, remaining asset backed conduit capacity, committed credit facility capacity and Federal Reserve discount window capacity, that we could utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events. In the event that access to capital markets, including the securitization market, is unavailable during the next twelve months, we believe that we would be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during that time by utilizing our deposit channels and our contingent funding sources. 80 Table of Contents Our liquidity reserve is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and other investments. Cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in deposits with the Federal Reserve, highly rated certificates of deposit, and triple A rated government mutual funds with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased. Other investments include certificates of deposit with maturities greater than 90 days and certain credit card asset backed securities of other issuers. The level of our liquidity reserve may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions. During 2009, we increased our liquidity reserve by $4.8 billion to $14.2 billion at November 30, 2009, in anticipation of approximately $19 billion in maturities of asset backed securities, certificates of deposit and senior unsecured notes in 2010, of which $12.5 billion are due in the first half of 2010.

Capital We seek to manage capital to levels and composition sufficient to support the risks of the business, meet regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines, and support future business growth. Our primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by the business, proceeds from participating in a government program, and equity raised through the capital markets. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies, we must maintain minimum levels of capital. These requirements are more fully described in Note 21: Capital Adequacy to our consolidated financial statements. At November 30, 2009, Discover Financial Services and our primary banking subsidiary, Discover Bank, maintained a well capitalized status, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject. In the third quarter of 2009, we took certain actions to adjust the credit enhancement structure of our securitization trusts as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Sources Securitization Financing above. These actions had the effect of including trust assets in our risk weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes effective July 2009. As a result, consolidation of the trusts under new accounting guidance effective on December 1, 2009, as described in Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations, will have a lesser impact on our regulatory capital calculations than would have otherwise been the case, because much of this effect has already been reflected as a result of the trust actions. However, the $1.4 billion charge to retained earnings as a result of adopting new accounting guidance will reduce our regulatory capital ratios as illustrated in Accounting Treatment for Off Balance Sheet Securitizations above. Nevertheless, both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank are expected to remain above well capitalized levels after the adoption of the new accounting guidance. Equity Capital. Equity increased to $8.5 billion at November 30, 2009 from $5.9 billion at November 30, 2008. Our capital level has been positively impacted by the closing of the $1.2 billion CPP transaction with the U.S. Treasury in March 2009 described below. In addition, in the third quarter 2009, we completed a $534 million common stock 81 Table of Contents offering in which we issued approximately 60 million shares. Our capital position in 2008 and 2009 has also been positively impacted by the Visa and Master Card antitrust litigation settlement more fully described below. Going forward, as we continue to evaluate our capital levels, we will also evaluate our continued participation in the CPP and we intend, at the appropriate time, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve, to repurchase our preferred stock from the U.S. Treasury. U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. On March 13, 2009, we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 1,224,558 shares of senior preferred stock and a ten year warrant to purchase 20,500,413 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8.96 per share, subject to anti dilution adjustments, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. The issuance is part of the U.S. Treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), under which the U.S. Treasury purchased senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy. The senior preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and pays a cumulative dividend at the rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and at the rate of nine percent per annum beginning May 15, 2014. The senior preferred stock is generally non voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock. The terms of the senior preferred stock provide that the stock may not be redeemed, as opposed to repurchased, prior to May 15, 2012 unless we have received aggregate gross proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings (as described below) of at least $306 million. In such a case, we may redeem the senior preferred stock, in whole or in part, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve, upon notice, up to a maximum amount equal to the aggregate net cash proceeds received by us from such qualified equity offerings. A qualified equity offering is a sale and issuance for cash by us, to persons other than us or our subsidiaries after March 13, 2009, of shares of perpetual preferred stock, common stock or a combination thereof, that in each case qualify as Tier 1 capital at the time of issuance under the applicable risk based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve. On or after May 15, 2012, the senior preferred stock may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve and notice requirements. However, pursuant to a letter agreement between us and the U.S. Treasury, we are permitted, after obtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve, to redeem the senior preferred stock at any time, and when such senior preferred stock is repaid, the U.S. Treasury is required to liquidate the warrant, all in accordance with The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as it may be amended from time to time (ARRA), and any rules and regulations thereunder. The U.S. Treasury may transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time. Participation in the CPP restricts our ability to increase dividends on our common stock above historical levels or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Participation in the CPP subjects us to increased oversight by the U.S. Treasury and banking regulators. The U.S. Treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulators. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has the right to appoint two directors to our board if we miss dividend payments for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, on the preferred stock. Participation in the CPP also subjects us to increased Congressional scrutiny. In connection with participating in the CPP, we became a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Registration as a bank holding company subjects us to new legal and regulatory requirements, including minimum capital requirements, and subjects us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. We are also subject to certain restrictions on executive compensation for our senior executive officers and the next 20 most highly compensated employees under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended (the EESA). Our senior executive officers for this purpose include our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the three most highly compensated executive officers other than the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. We 82 Table of Contents agreed that for such time as the U.S. Treasury continues to own any of our securities under the CPP, we will take all necessary action to ensure that our compensation and other benefit plans with respect to our senior executive officers and certain other employees comply with EESA restrictions relating to executive compensation, which include (i) limits on compensation and incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks that would threaten the value of the company, (ii) a provision for recovery (i.e., clawback) of amounts of compensation that later prove to have been based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other performance metrics, and (iii) limitations on golden parachute payments. Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury issued interim final rules implementing the compensation and corporate governance requirements under ARRA, which amended the requirements of EESA. For additional information, see Legislative and Regulatory Developments Compensation Developments. Additionally, we may not deduct for federal income tax purposes executive compensation of our senior executive officers in excess of $500,000 per year, which includes any portion of their stock based deferred compensation earned after our participation in the CPP. Dividends. Our board of directors declared a common stock cash dividend of $.02 per share in December 2009, payable on January 21, 2010, to holders of record on December 31, 2009. The quarterly common stock dividend was reduced from $.06 per share to $.02 per share in the first quarter of 2009 in order to enhance our capital position. This reduction to $.02 per share has strengthened our capital base by approximately $20 million per quarter. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends in the future. In addition, as a result of applicable banking law regulations and guidance and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be further limited. Under the terms of our CPP transaction, we are prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock above historical levels ($.06 per share) until March 2012 unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, dividend payments on our common stock will be prohibited unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock. Also in 2009, we accrued $43.9 million of dividends on our senior preferred stock issued under the CPP, which represents a rate of 5% per year. Special Dividend and Settlement of Visa and MasterCard Antitrust Litigation. On October 27, 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. We received a lump sum amount of $0.9 billion from MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $1.9 billion from Visa in 2009, which we recorded in other income in our Direct Banking segment, formerly referred to as our U.S. Card segment. At the time of our spin off, we entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley to give us sole control over the investigation, prosecution and resolution of the antitrust lawsuit with Visa and MasterCard and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared (the Special Dividend Agreement). As a result, we have incurred an obligation to accrue amounts pursuant to the Special Dividend Agreement with respect to settlement proceeds from Visa and MasterCard only to the extent that we have already earned and received such proceeds pursuant to the terms of the settlement with Visa and MasterCard as of the balance sheet date. At November 30, 2009, we had accrued $808.8 million in connection with the special dividend and $28.9 million in related other expenses. The Special Dividend Agreement is a subject of litigation between Morgan Stanley and us. See Legal Proceedings for additional background and recent developments related to this litigation. Stock Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. At November 30, 2009, we had not repurchased any stock under this program. Under the terms of our CPP transaction, we are prohibited from repurchasing our common stock until March 2012, except in connection with the administration of an employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock issued under the CPP is outstanding, we may not repurchase any of our shares of common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock. 83 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements See Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Sources Securitization Financing. Guarantees Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. See Note 22: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2009 include deposits, long term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2009 are summarized below (dollars in thousands): Payments Due By Period Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years More ThanFive Years Deposits $ 32,093,012 $ 14,826,778 $ 10,098,537 $ 5,958,198 $ 1,209,499 Long term borrowings(1) 2,428,246 621,930 306,316 1,500,000 Capital lease obligations 2,342 1,948 394 Operating leases 43,040 6,068 11,524 9,167 16,281 Interest payments on fixed rate debt 1,225,400 127,700 255,400 255,400 586,900 Purchase obligations(2) 267,155 150,792 72,854 16,927 26,582 Other long term liabilities(3) 367,132 199,870 30,221 36,699 100,342 Total contractual obligations $ 36,426,327 $ 15,935,086 $ 10,775,246 $ 6,276,391 $ 3,439,604 (1) See Note 12: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate notes is estimated to be $5.0 million as of November 30, 2009, utilizing the current interest rates as of that date. (2) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license and telecommunications agreements. Purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2009 reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition. (3) Other long term liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans and our prepaid FDIC special assessment. As of November 30, 2009 our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $305.7 million, and approximately $38.5 million of accrued interest and penalties. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated income tax obligations about which there is uncertainty, as addressed in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, (guidance formerly provided by FASB Interpretation No. 48), have been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 19: Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our tax obligations. We extended credit for consumer and commercial loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. During 2009, our unused commitments were reduced by $35 billion to $172 billion at November 30, 2009, as part of our risk management strategies. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements. 84 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets, principally managed loan receivables. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset backed securitizations, deposits, and short term and long term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree. Our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest earning deposits and certain investment securities. Although we have moved the majority of our credit card loans to variable rates, some of our loans are still at fixed rates. Due to new credit card legislation, we have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2009, we estimate that the pretax income (reported on a managed basis) over the following 12 month period would be increased by approximately $84 million. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2008, we estimated that the pretax income (reported on a managed basis) over the following 12 month period would be decreased by approximately $38 million. At November 30, 2009, a majority of our credit card loan receivables have moved to variable rates, which will have a positive impact on pretax income in a rising interest rate scenario. We have not provided an estimate of any impact on pretax income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels and, therefore, could not materially decrease further. 85 Table of Contents
