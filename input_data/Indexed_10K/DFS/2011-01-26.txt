Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K particularly under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, which immediately follows Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to Notes to our consolidated financial statements are to the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of November 30, 2010 and 2009 and for the three year period ended November 30, 2010. Introduction and Overview Discover Financial Services is a direct banking and payment services company. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, subject to oversight, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). We are also a financial holding company under the Gramm Leach Bliley Act. Through our Discover Bank subsidiary, we offer our customers credit cards, student loans, personal loans and deposit products. Through our DFS Services LLC subsidiary and its subsidiaries, we operate the Discover Network, the PULSE network (PULSE) and Diners Club International (Diners Club). The Discover Network provides credit card transaction processing for Discover card branded and third party issued credit cards. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally, as well as point of sale terminals at retail locations throughout the U.S. for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network that grants rights to licensees, which are generally financial institutions, to issue Diners Club branded credit cards and or to provide card acceptance services. Our Diners Club business also offers transaction processing and marketing services to licensees globally. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year. Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, merchants and issuers. The primary costs required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provisions, customer rewards, and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through the raising of consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of both secured and unsecured debt. Change in Accounting Principle Related to Off Balance Sheet Securitizations Beginning with the first quarter 2010, we have included the trusts used in our securitization activities in our consolidated financial results in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (Statement No. 166) (codified under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Section 860, Transfers and Servicing) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretations No. 46(R) (Statement No. 167) (codified under ASC Section 810, Consolidation), which were effective for us on December 1, 2009, the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Under Statement No. 166, the trusts used in our securitization transactions are no longer exempt from consolidation. Statement No. 167 prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on our financial statements. Based on our assessment, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT) and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT) (the trusts) and accordingly, we began consolidating the trusts on December 1, 2009. Using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by Statement No. 167, we recorded a $21.1 billion increase in total assets, a $22.4 billion increase in total liabilities and a $1.3 billion decrease in stockholders equity (comprised of a $1.4 billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of $0.1 billion in accumulated other comprehensive income). The significant adjustments to our statement of financial condition upon adoption of Statements No. 166 and 167 are outlined below: Consolidation of $22.3 billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors; 47 Table of Contents Reclassification of $4.6 billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables; Recording of a $2.1 billion allowance for loan losses, not previously required under GAAP, for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables; Derecognition of the remaining $0.1 billion value of the interest only strip receivable, net of tax, recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining $1.6 billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash, loan receivables and other assets; and Recording of net deferred tax assets of $0.8 billion, largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables. Beginning with the first quarter 2010, our results of operations no longer reflect securitization income, but instead report interest income, net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt. Additionally, we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans no longer receive sale accounting treatment. Also, there are no gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing. Because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales, the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities. Notwithstanding this accounting treatment, our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from Discover Bank, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts. Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data We did not retrospectively adopt Statements No. 166 and 167 and, therefore, the consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report as of and for the year ended November 30, 2010 reflect the new accounting requirements, but the historical statement of financial condition as of November 30, 2009 and statements of income and statements of cash flows for the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008 continue to reflect the accounting applicable prior to the adoption of the new accounting requirements. To enable the reader to better understand our financial information by reflecting period over period data on a consistent basis, this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presents our financial information as of and for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to adjusted results of operations data for the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, and, where necessary, we have also provided certain information as of and for the year ended November 30, 2007 and 2006 on an as adjusted basis. Management believes the adjusted financial information is useful to investors as it aligns with the financial information used in its decision making process and in evaluating the business. The as adjusted amounts: show how our financial data would have been presented if the trusts used in our securitization activities were consolidated into our financial statements for such historical periods; remove the impact of income received in connection with the settlement of our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard during the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008; and exclude the interest charge related to our dispute with Morgan Stanley regarding the special dividend agreement, which, among other things, specified how proceeds of the antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard were to be shared. The impacts of Statements No. 166 and 167 on our earnings summary, detail of other income and Direct Banking segment information are reflected in two steps in the reconciliations of GAAP to as adjusted data in the tables below. First, we made securitization adjustments to reverse the effect of loan securitization by recharacterizing securitization income to report interest income, expense, provision for loan losses, discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income in the same line items as non securitized loans. These adjustments result in a managed basis presentation, which we have historically included in our quarterly and annual reports to reflect the way in which our senior management evaluated our business performance and allocated resources. 48 Table of Contents Then, additional adjustments were made to reflect results as if the trusts used in our securitization activities had been fully consolidated in our historical results. These adjustments include: Elimination of interest income and interest expense related to certificated retained interests classified as investment securities and associated intercompany debt; An adjustment to the provision for loan losses for the change in securitized loan receivables; Elimination of the revaluation gains or losses associated with the interest only strip receivable, which was derecognized upon adoption; and An adjustment to reflect the income tax effects related to these adjustments. The impacts of Statements No. 166 and 167 on our effective tax rate, loan receivables and average balance sheet information and certain other selected financial data are reflected in one step, rather than two, in the reconciliations of GAAP to as adjusted data set forth in the tables below as there is no meaningful difference between such information on a historical managed basis as compared to on an as adjusted basis.

settlement of our antitrust litigation) and an as adjusted net loss of $237 million in 2009. After peaking in the first quarter, net charge offs declined throughout the remainder of 2010. Our over 30 day delinquencies declined throughout 2010 after peaking in the fourth quarter of 2009. At November 30, 2010, the twelve month outlook for credit had improved in comparison to the outlook at the end of 2009 resulting in a decline in the loan loss reserve rate, which led to a $598 million reduction of our allowance for loan losses in 2010. Discover card sales volume increased 6% in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to higher average spend per customer and broadened merchant acceptance. However, credit card loan receivables at November 30, 2010 were down 5%, to $45.2 billion, from November 30, 2009 as adjusted due to a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate. Our revenues were unfavorably impacted in 2010 by the implementation of CARD Act provisions, which included limitations on our ability to reprice accounts, the elimination of overlimit fees and a reduction in the amount of standard late fees. We made significant investments to strengthen the Discover brand in 2010, reflected in a 14% increase in marketing and business development expenses as compared to 2009. Transaction dollar volume in our Payment Services segment was $152 billion in 2010, an increase of 8% as compared to 2009, and the number of transactions processed on our PULSE network increased 15% during the same period. Pretax income for the segment was $141 million in 2010, an increase of 33% from 2009, reflecting increased volumes from new and existing clients, higher margins from transactions processed on our PULSE network and lower operating expenses. Direct to consumer deposits grew to $20.6 billion at November 30, 2010, an increase of $8 billion as compared to November 30, 2009. This increase included the acquisition of approximately $1 billion of deposits in the second quarter 2010. Our total equity at November 30, 2010 was $2.0 billion lower than it was at November 30, 2009, although our regulatory capital ratios continued to remain strong. The reduction in equity reflects a $1.3 billion reduction related to our adoption of FASB Statements No. 166 and 167 and a $1.4 billion reduction related to our redemption of our preferred stock and a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock that we previously issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. These reductions were partially offset by the addition of $765 million of net income. 2009 and 2008 Highlights In 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. We received $862.5 million from MasterCard ($535 million after tax) in the fourth quarter 2008 for its portion of the settlement. Throughout 2009, we received a total of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after tax) from Visa for its portion of the settlement. At the time of our spin off, we entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared, among other things. In 2010, we paid Morgan Stanley a dividend of $775 million under an amendment to that agreement. For additional details, see Note 21: Litigation to our consolidated financial statements. We acquired Diners Club International (Diners Club) for $168 million in June 2008. Diners Club has network licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded credit cards and or provide card acceptance services in over 185 countries and territories. We sold our United Kingdom credit card business (Goldfish) in March 2008. This business represented substantially all of our International Card segment, which is presented in discontinued operations in this report. 57 Table of Contents Outlook Credit performance improved throughout 2010 and we believe delinquencies and net charge offs will continue to improve in 2011 as compared to 2010 levels. We expect this improvement to result in further reductions of our loan loss reserves. In 2011, we expect the continued impact of the implementation of CARD Act provisions along with an anticipated increase in the volume of promotional rate offers to unfavorably impact credit card yield, although we believe it will be partially offset by continued improvement in interest charge offs. The decline in credit card yield, together with the addition of lower rate student loans from the acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation, discussed further below, will lead to a reduction in our net interest margin. We believe that the significant investments we made in marketing and advertising in 2010 will continue to benefit Discover card sales volumes in 2011. This along with an expected increase in the volume of promotional rate offers may result in a modest increase in the level of credit card loan receivables. At November 30, 2010, we had $10.1 billion in our liquidity investment portfolio. Maturities of deposit and securitization obligations leveled off in the second half of 2010 and we expect 2011 maturities will be relatively stable by comparison. In 2011, the level of our liquidity investment portfolio will fluctuate primarily due to asset requirements, maturity obligations and deposit cash flows. With respect to new funding, we expect to continue to grow direct to consumer deposits in 2011 and take advantage of opportunities to issue asset backed securities when we believe market conditions are favorable. We experienced strong growth in volumes in our payments business in 2010, which we expect to continue in 2011. Our investment in building brand awareness and global acceptance is expected to grow in 2011 compared to 2010 levels. We believe that our strategic network alliances with key card networks such as Koreas BC Card, Japans JCB, China UnionPay and Serbias DinaCard, along with the continued development of merchant acquirer relationships, will be our foundation for driving global acceptance and volumes. Recent Developments On December 31, 2010, we acquired The Student Loan Corporation (SLC) in a merger transaction for $600 million. We received a purchase price closing adjustment in the form of a cash payment of approximately $234 million from Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), the 80% owner of SLC before the merger, resulting in a net cash outlay of approximately $366 million for the acquisition of SLC. In the transaction, we acquired SLCs ongoing private student loan business and approximately $4.2 billion of private student loans and other assets, along with assuming approximately $3.4 billion of SLCs existing asset backed securitization debt funding and other liabilities. We acquired the loans and other assets at an 8.5% discount, which will be applied to the balance sheet items through purchase accounting entries. SLC is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Bank. The acquisition significantly increased the size of our private student loan portfolio, which was $1.0 billion at November 30, 2010. In addition, the acquisition has provided us with a developed student loan business platform, additional school relationships, experienced personnel and SLCs website. Legislative and Regulatory Developments Financial Regulatory Reform In July 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act), which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Reform Act, as well as other legislative and regulatory changes, could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices, requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, imposing additional costs on us, limiting fees we can charge for services, impacting the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses. The Reform Act addresses risks to the economy and the payments system, especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms, including bank holding companies with assets of at least $50 billion, which would include us. It 58 Table of Contents does so through a variety of measures, including increased capital and liquidity requirements, limits on leverage, enhanced supervisory authority (including authority to limit activities and growth), regulatory oversight of non banking entities, broad new powers to seize and wind down failed systemically important financial firms, including non bank financial companies (and the establishment of a mechanism to recover such costs through assessments on large financial firms), enhanced regulation of derivatives, restrictions on and additional disclosure of executive compensation, additional corporate governance requirements, and oversight of credit rating agencies. Effective July 2011, the Reform Act requires a bank holding company that elects treatment as a financial holding company, such as us, to be both well capitalized and well managed in addition to the existing requirement that a financial holding companys subsidiary banks be well capitalized and well managed. Additionally, the Reform Act established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the BCFP) within the Federal Reserve, which will regulate consumer financial products and services. On July 21, 2011, many consumer financial protection functions currently assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies will shift to the BCFP. The BCFP will have broad rulemaking authority over providers of credit, savings and payment services and products. The BCFP will be directed to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and ensure that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services, and that such markets are fair, transparent and competitive. The BCFP will have rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws and broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us. State officials will be authorized to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the BCFP. For more information regarding the BCFP and how it may affect us, see Risk Factors. In addition, the Reform Act requires, effective July 21, 2011, that interchange fees paid to or charged by payment card issuers on debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the issuers cost in connection with such transactions. The Reform Act directs the Federal Reserve to enact rules to implement this requirement and to prohibit debit card networks and issuers from requiring debit card transactions to be processed solely on a single payment network or two or more affiliated networks. Further, the Reform Act prohibits credit/debit network rules that restrict merchants from offering discounts to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment, or from setting minimum transaction amounts of $10.00 or less for use of credit cards, as long as such merchant practices do not differentiate on the basis of the issuer or network. The impact of these provisions on the debit card market and the PULSE network will depend upon Federal Reserve implementing regulations, the actions of our competitors, and the behavior of other marketplace participants. The Federal Reserve issued proposed regulations in December 2010, and we are currently evaluating the proposal. The provisions applicable to the debit card market may adversely affect PULSEs business practices, network transaction volume, revenue, and prospects for future growth. For more information regarding the potential impact of these provisions on us, see Risk Factors. In addition, the Reform Act contains several provisions that could increase the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance premiums paid by Discover Bank. See FDIC Initiatives Regarding Assessments below for more information. Various other assessments and fees are also authorized in the legislation and others could be authorized in the future. As described below under Asset Backed Securities Regulations, the Reform Act also imposes a number of significant changes relating to the asset backed securities and structured finance markets, which may impact our ability and or desire to utilize those markets to meet funding and liquidity needs. Many provisions of the Reform Act require the adoption of rules to implement. In addition, the Reform Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The effect of the Reform Act and its implementing regulations on our business and operations could be significant. In addition, we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Reform Act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it. The Reform Act, any related legislation and any implementing regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 59 Table of Contents Legislation Addressing Credit Card Practices In May 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act) was enacted. The CARD Act made numerous changes to the Truth in Lending Act, affecting the marketing, underwriting, pricing, billing and other aspects of the consumer credit card business. Several provisions of the CARD Act became effective in August 2009, but most of the requirements became effective in February 2010 and others became effective in August 2010. Certain provisions of the CARD Act have required us to make fundamental changes to our business practices and systems. We have made modifications to products, pricing, marketing strategies and other business practices designed to be in compliance with the law, to be attractive to consumers and to provide a good return for our stockholders. Certain CARD Act requirements, however, have reduced and will continue to reduce our interest income and loan fee income. See Risk Factors for more information. The long term impact of the CARD Act ultimately depends upon consumer behavior and the actions of our competitors, in addition to further Federal Reserve and BCFP interpretation of the provisions. The CARD Act also requires the Federal Reserve and the Government Accountability Office to conduct various studies, including a review of interchange fees, reasons for credit limit reductions and rate increases, small business cards, and credit card terms and disclosures. Based on the results of these studies, new requirements that negatively impact us may be introduced as future legislation or regulation. Asset Backed Securities Regulations While we have capacity to issue new asset backed securities from our credit card securitization trusts, there has been uncertainty in the securitization market as a result of revised accounting standards and related guidance from the FDIC as well as proposed new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules governing the issuance of asset backed securities and additional requirements contained in the Reform Act. FDIC Rule The ability of issuers of asset backed securities to obtain necessary credit ratings for their issuances has been based, in part, on the FDICs safe harbor rule entitled Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection with a Securitization or Participation, which provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not, using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP. Pursuant to FASB guidance for transfers of financial assets, effective for us on December 1, 2009, certain transfers of assets to special purpose entities (including Discover Banks transfer of assets to the Discover Card Master Trust) no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment. In March 2010, the FDIC published a transitional rule that preserved the safe harbor treatment applicable under the original FDIC safe harbor rule for beneficial interests in securitizations of revolving assets issued on or prior to September 30, 2010 so long as those securitizations would have complied with the original safe harbor under GAAP in effect prior to November 15, 2009. On September 27, 2010, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts that issued any securities on or prior to September 27, 2010, which includes the trusts used in our credit card securitization program. Other legislative and regulatory developments, namely the proposed SEC Regulation AB II, the securitization and rating agency provisions of the Reform Act and the federal banking agencies notice regarding their consideration of replacement of the ratings based approach for assessing capital charges against securitization exposures, may, however, impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future. See below for additional information. SEC Regulation AB II In April 2010, the SEC proposed revised rules for asset backed securities offerings (SEC Regulation AB II) that, if adopted, would substantially change the disclosure, reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset backed securities, including those offered under our credit card securitization program. The proposed rules, if adopted in their current form, would, among other things, impose as a condition for the shelf registration of asset backed securities a requirement that the sponsor of the asset backed securities offering hold a minimum of 5% of the nominal amount of each of the tranches sold or transferred to investors (or, in the case of revolving master trusts, an originators interest of a minimum of 5% of the nominal amount of the securitization exposures) and not hedge those holdings. Issuers 60 Table of Contents of publicly offered asset backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets and to file a computer program that demonstrates the effect of the transactions waterfall of distributions. In addition, the proposals would alter the safe harbor standards for the private placement of asset backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities. Reform Act The Reform Act also imposes a number of significant changes relating to the asset backed securities and structured finance markets, including a requirement that regulators jointly adopt regulations requiring the sponsor of a securitization to retain, subject to certain exemptions and exceptions, at least 5% unhedged credit risk on securitized exposures. The Reform Act also requires the SEC to impose asset level registration statement disclosure requirements if the data is necessary for investors to independently perform due diligence. Additionally, the Reform Act nullified Rule 436(g) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act) effective immediately, which had provided that credit ratings assigned by a rating agency would not be considered part of a registration statement prepared or certified by an expert. This change requires registrants (including issuers of asset backed securities) to obtain written consent of a credit rating agency in order to include the agencys rating in a registration statement and subjects the rating agencies to expert liability under Section 11 of the Securities Act for misstatements or omissions of materials facts in connection with such credit rating disclosure. In response to this measure, the major credit rating agencies issued statements indicating that they would be unwilling to provide the required consent. In order to provide a transition period, the SEC subsequently issued a no action letter in July 2010 allowing issuers of asset backed securities to omit credit ratings from registration statements until January 24, 2011. In November 2010, the SEC issued a second letter extending this no action period indefinitely. Failure to ultimately resolve this issue could impact our ability to offer registered asset backed securities. Section 939A of the Reform Act requires each federal agency to review and to remove references to external credit ratings from their regulations that require the use of an assessment of creditworthiness of a security, and to substitute in their place other standards of creditworthiness that the agencies determine to be appropriate for such regulations. In response to such requirement, in August 2010, the federal banking agencies issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting comment on alternatives to the use of credit ratings in their risk based capital rules for banking organizations, including alternatives to the ratings based approach in such rules for securitization exposures. It is not clear what alternatives will ultimately be adopted. Any such alternatives could, among other things, significantly affect the amount of capital that banking organizations are required to keep against such exposures. It is uncertain at this time what the rules implementing the provisions of the Reform Act related to asset backed securities will ultimately look like and what impact they will have on our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future. For instance, with respect to risk retention, we currently hold the sellers interest in our securitization trusts as well as certain subordinated tranches issued by these trusts, which collectively represent approximately 57% of the principal receivables balance in our trusts as of November 30, 2010. Although we believe it likely that any final regulations implementing the Reform Act risk retention requirements, which must be adopted on an interagency basis, will recognize these interests as satisfying the risk retention requirement, we will not have certainty until the proposed rules have been promulgated. The SEC recently published a timetable for the release of its rules implementing the provisions of the Reform Act including those impacting the issuance of asset backed securities, which are scheduled to be released by July 2011. However, the SEC has provided no timetable for implementing the disclosure changes in proposed SEC Regulation AB II, as the Reform Act does not mandate the timing for adoption of those changes. Student Loan Legislation The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA) requires all federal student loans originated after July 2010 to be made directly by the federal government, rather than by private institutions through the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Because HCERA allows financial institutions to continue offering private student loans, we do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on our private student loan program. The Reform Act referenced above provides for a study of private education loans and lenders and creates a private education loan ombudsman within the BCFP. The study could lead to additional legislation or regulation in the future. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress that would make it substantially easier for borrowers to discharge private student loans in bankruptcy, as described further below, and could be reintroduced in the next Congress. 61 Table of Contents Bankruptcy Legislation A bill referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee in the previous Congress would disallow claims in Chapter 7 bankruptcy based on high cost consumer debt and exclude consumers with such debt from the bankruptcy means test. The means test requires debtors who can afford to repay a portion of their debts through Chapter 13 repayment plan do so, rather than discharge all indebtedness under Chapter 7. The proposed legislation, if enacted, could increase the percentage of bankruptcy filers who obtain full debt discharges to the detriment of all unsecured lenders, and could result in increased charge offs of our loan receivables. It is unclear whether this legislation will be considered by the next Congress. Congress has also considered legislation to allow bankruptcy courts to restructure first mortgage loans (e.g., by reducing the loan amount to the value of the collateral, a process referred to as cramdown). Such a change would likely increase the number of individuals who file for bankruptcy, which would adversely impact all creditors including us. While the House of Representatives approved a cramdown bill, the Senate did not. This or similar legislation could be reintroduced in the next Congress. In addition, a Congressional subcommittee in the previous Congress approved a bill that would remove current limitations on the dischargeability of private student loan debts in bankruptcy. If enacted, the bill would make it substantially easier for borrowers of private student loans to obtain a discharge of their student loan debts. This bill could be reintroduced in the next Congress. If such legislation were to be enacted into law, it could substantially increase the credit losses of our private student loan business. Compensation Developments In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, together with the FDIC and the other banking agencies, issued final guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation practices of financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safety and soundness. The Federal Reserve recently conducted a special horizontal review of compensation practices at more than twenty large complex banking organizations, including us, with the expectation that incentive compensation practices appropriately balance risk and financial results and avoid creating incentives for employees to take imprudent risks. The Reform Act described above under Financial Regulatory Reform imposes additional disclosures and restrictions on compensation. FDIC Initiatives Regarding Assessments The Reform Act contains several provisions that could increase the FDIC deposit insurance premiums paid by Discover Bank. One provision includes a change in the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of total deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity. Another provision includes an increase in the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits (with the FDIC having until September 30, 2020 to meet the new minimum through assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more) while also removing the cap on the size of the fund. As required by the Reform Act, in October 2010, the FDIC announced its plan to increase the required reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35% by September 30, 2020 utilizing new rate schedules. This was followed by two proposals issued by the FDIC in November 2010. In its first proposal, the FDIC proposed to implement the provision of the Reform Act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on insured deposits to one based on average consolidated assets less tangible equity and change the assessment rate schedules so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as under the rate schedules proposed by the FDIC in October 2010. The second FDIC proposal would revise the risk based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions (generally, those with at least $10 billion in total assets). Any future increases in assessments would decrease our earnings and could adversely affect our results of operations. International Initiatives Related to Capital and Liquidity The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released two consultative documents proposing significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements in December 2009, commonly referred to as Basel III. The Basel Committee considered public comments received on the December proposal, the results of a qualitative impact study and the economic impact over the transition period. In July 2010, the Committee issued statements that reflected, among other things, decisions reached on certain elements of the comprehensive proposals, including the overall design of the capital and liquidity reform package. 62 Table of Contents In September 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, announced minimum capital ratios and transition periods and endorsed the statements the Committee released in July 2010. Following endorsement of the Basel III reform package by the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G 20) in November 2010, in December 2010 the Basel Committee released the Basel III rules text. Basel III provides that: (i) the minimum requirement for the Tier 1 common equity ratio will be increased from the current 2% level to 4.5%, to be phased in by January 1, 2015, and (ii) the minimum requirement for the Tier 1 capital ratio will be increased from 4% to 6%, to be phased in by January 1, 2015. The Tier 1 common equity ratio will be calculated after applying certain regulatory deductions, including for deferred tax assets above prescribed limitations that arise from timing differences. In addition, Basel III includes a capital conservation buffer that requires banking organizations to maintain an additional 2.5% of Tier 1 common equity to total risk weighted assets on top of the minimum requirement, which will be phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress and, while banks are allowed to draw on the buffer during periods of stress, if a banks regulatory capital ratios approach the minimum requirement, the bank will be subject to constraints on earnings distributions. In addition, Basel III includes a countercyclical buffer within a range of 0% 2.5%, which would be implemented according to a particular nations circumstances. These capital requirements are supplemented under Basel III by a non risk based leverage ratio. A minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3% will be tested during the parallel run period starting January 1, 2013. Based on the results of the parallel run period, any final adjustments would be carried out in the first half of 2017. Basel III states that systemically important banks should have higher loss absorbing capacity than required by the Basel III standards. The Committee will complete a study of the magnitude of additional loss absorbency that global systemically important banks should have by mid 2011. Basel III also reaffirms the Basel Committees intention to introduce higher capital requirements on securitization and trading activities at the end of 2011. The Basel III liquidity proposals have three main elements: (i) a liquidity coverage ratio designed to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality assets sufficient to meet the banks liquidity needs over a 30 day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario, (ii) a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding of the assets and activities of banks over a one year time horizon, and (iii) a set of monitoring tools that the Basel Committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors. After an observation period beginning in 2011, the liquidity coverage ratio will become effective on January 1, 2015. The revised net stable funding ratio will become effective January 1, 2018. Implementation of Basel III in the U.S. will require implementing regulations and guidelines by U.S. banking regulators, which may differ in significant ways from the recommendations published by the Basel Committee. It is unclear how U.S. banking regulators will define well capitalized in their implementation of Basel III. The Reform Act also includes provisions related to increased capital and liquidity requirements. Such provisions would establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for all depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions that cannot be less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment of the Reform Act (i.e., July 21, 2010). We are not able to predict at this time the precise content of capital and liquidity guidelines or regulations that may be adopted by regulatory agencies having authority over us and our subsidiaries or the impact that any changes in regulation would have on us. However, we expect that the new standards will generally require us or our banking subsidiaries to maintain more capital, with common equity as a more predominant component, or manage the configuration of our assets and liabilities in order to comply with formulaic liquidity requirements, which could significantly impact our return on equity, financial condition, operations, capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities. 63 Table of Contents Results of Operations The discussion below provides a summary of our results of operations for the years ended November 30, 2010 compared to our results of operations for the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008 as adjusted. The discussion also provides information about our loan receivables as of November 30, 2010 as compared to November 30, 2009 and 2008 as adjusted. In certain tables, quantitative information about our loan receivables as of November 30, 2007 and 2006 are also shown on an as adjusted basis. For a reconciliation of GAAP to as adjusted financial data, see Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. All information and comparisons are based solely on continuing operations. Segments We manage our business activities in two segments: Direct Banking, and Payment Services. In compiling the segment results that follow, our Direct Banking segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by our Payment Services segment. Direct Banking. Our Direct Banking segment includes Discover card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses that are accepted on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including student loans, personal loans, prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary. Payment Services. Our Payment Services segment includes the PULSE network, an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and our third party issuing business, which includes credit, debit and prepaid cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties. The following table presents segment data (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 Direct Banking(1) Interest income $ 6,146,199 $ 6,434,054 $ 6,487,904 Interest expense 1,582,745 1,605,277 2,311,241 Net interest income 4,563,454 4,828,777 4,176,663 Provision for loan losses 3,206,705 5,123,030 3,476,644 Other income 1,827,414 1,946,270 2,014,584 Other expense 2,056,685 2,087,970 2,314,926 Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,127,478 (435,953 ) 399,677 Payment Services(2) Interest income 19 1,098 3,165 Interest expense 243 222 83 Net interest income (224 ) 876 3,082 Provision for loan losses Other income 267,585 239,794 179,200 Other expense 125,980 134,126 100,871 Income before income tax expense 141,381 106,544 81,411 Total income (loss) before income tax expense $ 1,268,859 $ (329,409 ) $ 481,088 (1) The 2009 and 2008 Direct Banking segment information is presented on an as adjusted basis. No adjustments have been made to the Payment Services segment. See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. (2) Diners Club was acquired on June 30, 2008. 64 Table of Contents The following table presents information on transaction volume (in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 2008 Network Transaction Volume PULSE network $ 118,178,821 $ 109,302,121 $ 106,012,108 Third Party Issuers 6,802,480 5,671,555 6,398,579 Diners Club(1) 27,132,901 26,172,977 12,685,690 Total Payment Services 152,114,202 141,146,653 125,096,377 Discover Network Proprietary(2) 95,759,835 90,688,997 95,688,443 Total Volume $ 247,874,037 $ 231,835,650 $ 220,784,820 Transactions Processed on Networks Discover Network 1,605,114 1,513,955 1,515,368 PULSE network 3,308,543 2,878,720 2,682,312 Total 4,913,657 4,392,675 4,197,680 Credit Card Volume Discover Card Volume(3) $ 98,698,861 $ 95,592,170 $ 105,734,055 Discover Card Sales Volume(4) $ 92,470,523 $ 87,460,552 $ 92,239,779 (1) Diners Club was acquired on June 30, 2008.

(2) Represents gross proprietary sales volume on the Discover Network. (3) Represents Discover card activity related to net sales, balance transfers, cash advances and fee based products. (4) Represents Discover card activity related to net sales. Direct Banking For the Year Ended November 30, 2010 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2009 Our Direct Banking segment had pretax income of $1.1 billion for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to a reported pretax income of $2.0 billion (which included $1.9 billion in income from the settlement of our antitrust litigation) and an as adjusted pretax loss of $436 million for the year ended 2009. Discover card sales volume was up for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009 reflecting higher average spend per customer and a continued increase in merchant acceptance. Loan receivables totaled $48.8 billion at November 30, 2010, which was down from $50.9 billion at November 30, 2009 as adjusted, reflecting a decline in credit card loans and federal student loans, partially offset by an increase in personal loans and private student loans. Although sales volumes increased, credit card loans declined as a result of a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate. In 2010, we sold $1.5 billion in federal student loans to the U.S. Department of Education and classified the remaining $788 million of federal student loan balances as held for sale. Net interest income declined during 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted, largely due to a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a lower net interest margin. The decline in net interest margin is reflective of the impact of legislative changes on credit card yield and an increase in the average level of lower rate student loan balances, partially offset by higher interest rates earned on standard balances and fewer promotional rate balances. At November 30, 2010, our over 30 days delinquency rate was 3.89% as compared to 5.31% at November 30, 2009 as adjusted, reflective of continued improvement in credit performance. For the year ended November 30, 2010, our net charge off rate declined to 7.57%, compared to 7.77% for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted. A reduction in the loan loss reserve rate and a decline in the level of net charge offs led to a decline in the provision for loan losses for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted. For a more detailed discussion on provision for loan losses, see Loan Quality Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses. Other income decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted primarily due to the discontinuance of overlimit fees on consumer credit card loans beginning in February 2010 and a decline in late fees beginning in August 2010 in 65 Table of Contents connection with implementing the provisions of the CARD Act. Other income in 2010 also included a $23 million charge related to the decision we made in 2010 to sell our remaining federal student loans. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue and a $19.6 million gain related to the liquidation of collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC (Golden Key). Other expenses decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted as the impact of the cost containment initiatives begun in 2009, particularly those related to employee compensation and benefits and information processing and communications, largely offset the impact of higher marketing expenses. Additionally, the first quarter of 2010 benefited from a $29 million expense reversal related to the payment to Morgan Stanley under an amendment to the special dividend agreement, while the second quarter of 2009 included a $20 million restructuring charge related to a reduction in force. For the Year Ended November 30, 2009 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2008 Our Direct Banking segment had reported pretax income of $2.0 billion in the year ended November 30, 2009 as compared to reported pretax income of $1.6 billion in the year ended November 30, 2008. The Direct Banking segment had an as adjusted pretax loss of $436 million in 2009 as compared to an as adjusted pretax income of $400 million in 2008. Rising unemployment and bankruptcy levels adversely impacted customer delinquencies and charge offs in 2009, resulting in a 5.31% over 30 days delinquency rate at November 30, 2009 as adjusted, up from 4.56% at November 30, 2008 as adjusted. For the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, the total net charge off rate was 7.77%, up 276 basis points from the year ended November 30, 2008 as adjusted. The provision for loan losses increased for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted compared to 2008 as adjusted, as a result of higher charge offs and a higher reserve rate, reflective of the economic environment during 2009. Discover card sales volume was down for the year ended November 30, 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting lower gas prices and a general decline in consumer spending. Loan receivables of $50.9 billion at November 30, 2009 as adjusted were relatively unchanged from November 30, 2008 as adjusted as lower payments from our credit card customers and growth in both student and personal loans were largely offset by lower balance transfer activity and sales volume. Net interest income increased in 2009 as adjusted compared to 2008 as adjusted due to the impact of higher interest rates earned on standard balances, a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances and lower interest rates on borrowings, partially offset by higher interest charge offs. Other income decreased during 2009 as adjusted as compared to 2008 as adjusted, primarily due a decrease in loan fee income partially offset by increases in discount and interchange revenue, fee product revenue and lower losses on investment securities. Other expense decreased during 2009 as adjusted compared to 2008, reflecting the impact of lower marketing and litigation expenses along with cost containment initiatives, such as a reduction of headcount. Additionally, other expenses in 2008 were lower due to a $39 million benefit related to the curtailment of our pension plan. Payment Services For the Year Ended November 30, 2010 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2009 Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $141 million for the year ended November 30, 2010, up $35 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009. Revenues were up $28 million as a result of increased volumes from new and existing clients, as well as higher margins from transactions on the PULSE network. Expenses were down $8 million primarily due to transaction processing cost reduction initiatives as well as a lower level of international marketing investments. Transaction dollar volume for the year ended November 30, 2010 was $152 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the year ended November 30, 2009. The increase in transaction dollar volume was driven by higher volumes from all three contributors of our payments business, particularly PULSE volume. The number of transactions on the PULSE network increased by 15% for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009. 66 Table of Contents For the Year Ended November 30, 2009 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2008 Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $107 million for the year ended November 30, 2009, up $25 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. Revenues were up $61 million mainly driven by increased transaction volume on the PULSE network, along with lower incentive payments and higher fee revenue. Expenses were also up $33 million including a higher level of international marketing investments, partially offset by the impact of cost containment initiatives. Additionally, the increase in both revenues and expenses during 2009 is due to the inclusion of Diners Club for the full year, as compared to half a year since its acquisition in June 2008. Transaction dollar volume for the year ended November 30, 2009 was $141 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the year ended November 30, 2008. The increase in transaction dollar volume was driven primarily by the inclusion of Diners Club for the full year, as compared to a half a year in 2008, in addition to higher activity from new and existing financial institutions on the PULSE network. These were partially offset by the loss of volume from one large financial institution along with lower third party issuer volume as a result of lower gasoline prices and lower overall spending. Critical Accounting Estimates In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses, the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Allowance for Loan Losses We base our allowance for loan loss on several analyses that help us estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date. While our estimation process includes historical data and analysis, there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance. We use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. In the first quarter 2010, management refined its ability to estimate loss emergence by using other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts. The considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, and forecasting uncertainties. Given the same information, others may reach different reasonable conclusions. If management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in managements estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $330 million in the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2010, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. See Loan Quality and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses. Customer Rewards Cost We offer our customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customers purchases. The liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition. We compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity. The liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. We estimate forfeitures based on historical account 67 Table of Contents closure and charge off experience, actual customer purchase activity and the terms of the rewards programs. We recognize reward costs as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income. If management used a different estimate of forfeitures, our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of November 30, 2010, could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $10 million. The corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue. See Other Income and Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about credit card rewards cost. Goodwill and Other Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets. In addition, we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the Diners Club business. As required by GAAP, we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the business unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. Because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable businesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses. Similarly, in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models. In applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. We may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. The valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. If economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when recognized, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. At November 30, 2010, there were no reporting units or intangible assets that were at reasonable risk for failing the respective impairment evaluations. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the United States, its states and municipalities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. Changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. When such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant. See Note 17: Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes. 68 Table of Contents Earnings Summary The following table outlines changes in our consolidated statement of income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2010 vs. 2009increase (decrease) 2009 vs. 2008increase (decrease) 2010 2009 (AsAdjusted1) 2008 (AsAdjusted1) $ % $ % Interest income $ 6,146,218 $ 6,435,152 $ 6,491,069 $ (288,934 ) (4 %) $ (55,917 ) (1 %) Interest expense 1,582,988 1,605,499 2,311,324 (22,511 ) (1 %) (705,825 ) (31 %) Net interest income 4,563,230 4,829,653 4,179,745 (266,423 ) (6 %) 649,908 16 % Provision for loan losses 3,206,705 5,123,030 3,476,644 (1,916,325 ) (37 %) 1,646,386 47 % Net interest income after provision for loan losses 1,356,525 (293,377 ) 703,101 1,649,902 NM (996,478 ) (142 %) Other income 2,094,999 2,186,064 2,193,784 (91,065 ) (4 %) (7,720 ) 0 % Other expense 2,182,665 2,222,096 2,415,797 (39,431 ) (2 %) (193,701 ) (8 %) Income (loss) before income tax expense 1,268,859 (329,409 ) 481,088 1,598,268 NM (810,497 ) (168 %) Income tax expense (benefit) 504,071 (92,125 ) 150,162 596,196 NM (242,287 ) (161 %) Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 764,788 $ (237,284 ) $ 330,926 $ 1,002,072 NM $ (568,210 ) (172 %) (1) See Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. Net Interest Income The tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of average total loan receivables). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity investment portfolio, on net interest income. Our interest earning assets consist of: (i) loan receivables, (ii) cash and cash equivalents, which includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve, highly rated certificates of deposit, and triple A rated government mutual funds, (iii) restricted cash, (iv) short term investments and (v) investment securities. Our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct to consumer and brokered, and long term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. Net interest income is influenced by the following: The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other consumer loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates; The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income; The terms of long term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; The level and composition of other interest bearing assets and liabilities, including our liquidity investment portfolio; Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR; and The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program. For the Year Ended November 30, 2010 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2009 Net interest income was $4.6 billion for the year ended November 30, 2010, a decline of 6% as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted. The decline in net interest income was primarily due to a lower average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a decline in net interest margin. 69 Table of Contents Net interest margin was 9.14% for the year ended November 30, 2010, down 31 basis points as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted. This reflects a greater proportion of lower rate student loans in our loan portfolio for much of the year, lower rates earned on higher balances in our liquidity investment portfolio and higher rates paid on long term borrowings, partially offset by lower deposit funding costs and an improvement in credit card yield. Yield on credit card loan receivables improved as a result of fewer promotional rate balances and higher interest rates earned on standard balances, partially offset by the impact of legislative changes related to restrictions on increasing interest rates on existing balances beginning in February 2010. Although the yield on credit card loan receivables was higher for the full year 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted, the credit card yield during the fourth quarter 2010 was lower than the fourth quarter 2009 as adjusted. In 2011, we expect the credit card yield to decline as a result of the continued impact of the implementation of CARD Act provisions and a planned increase in promotional rate offers. The level of net interest income also declined during the year ended November 30, 2010, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, because of a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables, which was driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate. This was partially offset by an increase in the level of student loans and a higher average level of liquidity. Interest expense declined slightly for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted largely as a result of lower interest expense on securitized debt and deposits offset by higher expense associated with subordinated debt issuances in late 2009 and April 2010. Interest expense on securitized debt declined because of a significant level of maturities in the first half of 2010. Interest expense on deposits declined as the decline in deposit interest rates more than offset the higher level of deposit borrowings, which replaced the maturing asset backed securities. For the Year Ended November 30, 2009 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2008 Net interest income was $4.8 billion for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, an increase of 16% as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008 as adjusted. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in net interest margin along with an increase in the average level of loan receivables. Net interest margin was 9.45% for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, up 92 basis points as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008 as adjusted. The increase was due to lower funding costs partially offset by a lower yield on our loan receivables and liquidity investment portfolio. In 2008, interest expense was negatively impacted by the disruptions in the capital markets, which caused the differential between LIBOR (the rate to which our securitized borrowings are benchmarked) and the Federal Funds rate (which impacts the prime rate, the rate to which our floating rate credit card receivables are benchmarked). By 2009, the differential between LIBOR and the Federal Funds rate had narrowed to more normalized ranges. The yield on loan receivables was 12.40% for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, down 19 basis points as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008 as adjusted due to a higher level of student and personal loans, which earn lower interest rates. The yield on credit card loans was 12.63% in both 2009 as adjusted and 2008 as adjusted as an increase in rates on standard balances and a reduction in promotional rate balances were offset by an increase in finance charge charge offs. The increase in net interest income in 2009 as adjusted as compared to 2008 as adjusted was also due to an increase in the average level of loan receivables. This was primarily attributable to a decline in the credit card payment rate and an increase in both student and personal loan receivable balances, partially offset by lower balance transfer activity and lower sales volume. Interest expense declined significantly for the period ending November 30, 2009 as adjusted compared to the same period in 2008 as adjusted primarily due to a decline in funding costs related to securitized borrowings as discussed above. Throughout 2009 we grew our deposits business, which provided a significant source of funds while the securitization market was disrupted. Due to the decline in benchmark deposit rates throughout 2009, our cost of funds related to deposits improved during 2009 as compared to 2008. 70 Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet Analysis 2010 2009 (As Adjusted1) 2008 (As Adjusted1) AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest Assets Interest earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,628,759 0.25 % $ 24,319 $ 8,854,380 0.56 % $ 50,024 $ 8,374,905 2.64 % $ 220,744 Restricted cash 2,124,343 0.16 % 3,419 2,438,438 0.75 % 18,195 2,770,260 3.43 % 95,060 Other short term investments 235,549 1.03 % 2,435 662,979 0.59 % 3,883 Investment securities 1,688,453 1.55 % 26,222 485,117 5.20 % 25,230 194,674 2.75 % 5,352 Loan receivables:(2) Credit card(3) 45,616,791 12.79 % 5,836,002 48,844,325 12.63 % 6,169,303 48,229,519 12.63 % 6,090,218 Other(4) 4,292,396 5.91 % 253,821 2,285,792 7.37 % 168,517 781,629 10.20 % 79,695 Total loan receivables 49,909,187 12.20 % 6,089,823 51,130,117 12.40 % 6,337,820 49,011,148 12.59 % 6,169,913 Total interest earning assets 63,586,291 9.67 % 6,146,218 63,571,031 10.12 % 6,435,152 60,350,987 10.76 % 6,491,069 Allowance for loan losses (3,870,545 ) (3,550,229 ) (2,033,339 ) Other assets 3,978,625 3,139,709 2,521,878 Assets from discontinued operations 1,321,595 Total assets $ 63,694,371 $ 63,160,511 $ 62,161,121 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits: Time deposits(5) $ 27,274,405 3.84 % 1,046,108 $ 24,748,485 4.52 % 1,117,396 $ 21,208,003 5.01 % 1,062,741 Savings deposits 7,262,870 1.43 % 104,134 4,349,107 1.59 % 69,288 4,439,434 3.07 % 136,271 Other interest bearing deposits 21,178 1.24 % 262 25,998 1.54 % 400 40,337 1.05 % 424 Total interest bearing deposits(6) 34,558,453 3.33 % 1,150,504 29,123,590 4.08 % 1,187,084 25,687,774 4.67 % 1,199,436 Borrowings: Short term borrowings 410 0.24 % 1 837,452 0.30 % 2,538 37,660 0.91 % 343 Securitized borrowings 17,247,078 1.58 % 272,535 22,720,700 1.56 % 354,215 26,897,712 3.80 % 1,023,320 Other long term borrowings(5) 2,736,017 5.85 % 159,948 1,648,735 3.74 % 61,662 1,919,147 4.60 % 88,225 Total borrowings 19,983,505 2.16 % 432,484 25,206,887 1.66 % 418,415 28,854,519 3.85 % 1,111,888 Total interest bearing liabilities 54,541,958 2.90 % 1,582,988 54,330,477 2.96 % 1,605,499 54,542,293 4.24 % 2,311,324 Liabilities of discontinued operations 968,406 Other liabilities and stockholders equity 9,152,413 8,830,034 6,650,422 Total liabilities and stockholders equity $ 63,694,371 $ 63,160,511 $ 62,161,121 Net interest income $ 4,563,230 $ 4,829,653 $ 4,179,745 Net interest margin(7) 9.14 % 9.45 % 8.53 % Net yield on interest earning assets(8) 7.18 % 7.60 % 6.93 % Interest rate spread(9) 6.77 % 7.16 % 6.52 % (1) Information related to restricted cash, investment securities, credit card loan receivables, allowance for loan losses, other assets, securitized borrowings, other long term borrowings and other liabilities and stockholders equity are presented on an as adjusted basis.

See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. 72 Table of Contents Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include: The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements; Changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors; Changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio; The level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs; The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts; and Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance. In calculating the allowance for loan losses, we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics, such as credit card and other consumer loans. For our credit card loans, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. We use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts which broadens the identification of loss emergence. We use these analyses together to determine our allowance for loan losses. For the year ended November 30, 2010, the provision for loan losses decreased $1.9 billion as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted. This decrease is attributable to lower net charge offs, discussed in Net Charge offs below, and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The reduction in the allowance for loan losses was due to improved delinquency statistics, which resulted in lower loan loss reserve rates, as well as a $2.3 billion decline in the level of credit card loans. More specifically, our allowance at November 30, 2010 was $3.3 billion, a decline of $598 million as compared to November 30, 2009 as adjusted. This full year net reduction in the allowance includes a $305 million increase to the allowance in the first quarter 2010 upon managements consideration of refined analytics that expanded its ability to identify loss emergence. By comparison, the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2009 as adjusted was $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion as compared to the prior year. For the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, the provision for loan losses increased $1.6 billion, or 47%, compared to the year ended November 30, 2008 as adjusted, primarily due to higher net charge offs resulting from the deterioration in the economic environment. Additionally, because of rising delinquencies, the loan loss reserve rate increased 228 basis points in 2009 as adjusted and we added $1.1 billion to our as adjusted allowance for loan losses. In comparison, the reserve rate increased 180 basis points in 2008 as adjusted and we added $1.0 billion to our as adjusted allowance for loan losses. For other consumer loans, we consider historical and forecasted losses in estimating the related allowance for loan losses. At November 30, 2010, the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans decreased by $16 million as compared to November 30, 2009. This is largely attributable to a decline in our personal loan reserve rate due to credit improvement in that portfolio. This was partially offset by a reserve increase related to a higher level of private student loans. At November 30, 2009, the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans increased by $54 million as compared to November 30, 2008 mainly due to increased personal loan and private student loan balances. 73 Table of Contents The following table provides changes in our allowance for loan losses for the years presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009 (As Adjusted1) 2008 (As Adjusted1) 2007 (As Adjusted1) 2006 (As Adjusted1) Balance at beginning of year, as adjusted $ 3,902,360 $ 2,754,357 $ 1,731,655 $ 1,632,291 $ 1,948,823 Additions: Provision for loan losses 3,206,705 5,123,030 3,476,644 1,896,753 1,438,746 Deductions: Charge off related to loans sold (25,342 ) Charge offs: Discover card (4,094,236 ) (4,242,494 ) (2,832,771 ) (2,201,741 ) (2,180,146 ) Discover business card (59,986 ) (62,115 ) (19,814 ) (2,418 ) Total credit card loans (4,154,222 ) (4,304,609 ) (2,852,585 ) (2,204,159 ) (2,180,146 ) Personal loans (92,351 ) (68,590 ) (7,974 ) (1,857 ) (3,962 ) Federal student loans (719 ) Private student loans (2,783 ) (468 ) (8 ) Other (1,018 ) (22 ) (83 ) (25 ) (29 ) Total other consumer loans (96,871 ) (69,080 ) (8,065 ) (1,882 ) (3,991 ) Total charge offs (4,251,093 ) (4,373,689 ) (2,860,650 ) (2,206,041 ) (2,184,137 ) Recoveries: Discover card 466,548 396,483 405,844 407,606 427,799 Discover business card 3,549 1,233 272 35 Total credit card loans 470,097 397,716 406,116 407,641 427,799 Personal loans 1,307 906 576 988 974 Private student loans 38 2 Other 46 38 16 23 86 Total other consumer loans 1,391 946 592 1,011 1,060 Total recoveries 471,488 398,662 406,708 408,652 428,859 Net charge offs (3,779,605 ) (3,975,027 ) (2,453,942 ) (1,797,389 ) (1,755,278 ) Balance at end of year $ 3,304,118 $ 3,902,360 $ 2,754,357 $ 1,731,655 $ 1,632,291 (1) Information related to Discover card and total loans is presented on an adjusted basis.

See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. 74 Table of Contents Net Charge offs Our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income, respectively, for loan receivables while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due. Closed end consumer loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past due. Generally, customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day or 120 day contractual time frame. The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2010 2009(As Adjusted1) 2008(As Adjusted1) 2007(As Adjusted1) 2006(As Adjusted1) $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Credit card loans $ 3,684,125 8.08 % $ 3,906,893 8.00 % $ 2,446,469 5.07 % $ 1,796,518 3.84 % $ 1,752,347 3.96 % Other consumer loans 95,480 2.22 % 68,134 2.98 % 7,473 0.96 % 871 0.85 % 2,931 2.22 % Total net charge offs $ 3,779,605 7.57 % $ 3,975,027 7.77 % $ 2,453,942 5.01 % $ 1,797,389 3.83 % $ 1,755,278 3.95 % (1) Information related to credit card loan receivables and total loan receivables is presented on an as adjusted basis. No adjustments have been made for other consumer loan receivables. See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. The amount of charge offs on credit card loans decreased for the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted. The level of contractual and bankruptcy charge offs had peaked by the end of the first quarter of 2010 and then declined throughout 2010 as a result of improvement in the economic environment and recoveries. However, the net charge off rate on our credit card loans increased slightly for the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted due to a lower average level of credit card loans. The seasoning of our personal loan portfolio has led to higher charge off amounts in other consumer loans during the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009, but the charge off rate for other consumer loans declined overall due to an increase in the average level of student loans, as newly originated student loans had not yet entered into repayment and, thus, had minimal levels of net charge offs. The increase in our charge off rate and amount on our loan receivables for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted compared to November 30, 2008 as adjusted is reflective of the weakened economic environment, including rising unemployment, an increase in bankruptcy related charge offs and a decrease in the availability of consumer credit during the period. Additionally, personal loans, which are included in other consumer loans, grew significantly in 2008 and into 2009, had seasoned and had started to experience charge offs. Delinquencies Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. Credit card and closed end consumer loan receivables are placed on nonaccrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a customer or suspected fraudulent activity on an account. In some cases of suspected fraudulent activity, loan receivables may resume accruing interest upon completion of the fraud investigation. 75 Table of Contents The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days delinquent, loan receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands): At November 30, 2010 2009(As Adjusted1) 2008(As Adjusted1) 2007(As Adjusted1) 2006(As Adjusted1) $ % $ % $ % $ % $ % Loans over 30 days delinquent $ 1,901,924 3.89 % $ 2,700,959 5.31 % $ 2,330,208 4.56 % $ 1,723,320 3.58 % $ 1,552,037 3.39 % Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest $ 853,757 1.75 % $ 1,217,054 2.39 % $ 952,565 1.86 % $ 695,302 1.44 % $ 604,793 1.32 % Loans not accruing interest $ 325,900 0.67 % $ 438,278 0.86 % $ 366,508 0.72 % $ 256,694 0.53 % $ 261,777 0.57 % (1) See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest decreased 142 basis points and 64 basis points, respectively at November 30, 2010 as compared to November 30, 2009 as adjusted. The decline in delinquency rates is mainly due to better credit trends as well as enhanced collection management and underwriting processes. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2010 decreased 19 basis points to 0.67%, as compared to November 30, 2009 as adjusted, as a result of a decrease in bankruptcy notifications. The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 75 basis points and 53 basis points, respectively at November 30, 2009 as adjusted, as compared to November 30, 2008 as adjusted. The increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our customers ability to pay their loan balances. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2009 increased 14 basis points to 0.86% as adjusted, as compared to November 30, 2008 as adjusted, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications. Maturities and Sensitivities of Loan Receivables to Changes in Interest Rates Our loan portfolio had the following maturity distribution(1) at November 30, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Due OneYear orLess Due AfterOne YearThroughFive Years Due AfterFive Years Total Credit card loans $ 15,138,461 $ 24,151,916 $ 5,866,617 $ 45,156,994 Other consumer loans 9,540 1,369,071 1,512,707 2,891,318 Total loan portfolio $ 15,148,001 $ 25,520,987 $ 7,379,324 $ 48,048,312 (1) Because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments. Historically, actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and, therefore, the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments. At November 30, 2010, approximately $21.4 billion of our loan portfolio due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $11.5 billion were fixed rate loans. Modified and Restructured Loans We hold various credit card loans for which the terms have been modified, including some that are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings. Our modified credit card loans include loans for which temporary hardship concessions have been granted and loans in permanent workout programs. Eligibility, frequency, duration and offer type for both of these programs are designed to comply with regulatory guidelines. Temporary hardship concessions primarily consist of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction, both lasting for a period no longer than twelve months. These short term concessions do not include the forgiveness of unpaid 76 Table of Contents principal, but may involve the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. At the end of the concession period, loan terms revert to standard rates. These arrangements are automatically terminated if the customer makes two consecutive late payments, at which time their account reverts back to its original terms. In assessing the appropriate allowance for loan loss, these loans are included in the general pool of credit cards with the allowance determined under the contingent loss model of ASC 450 20, Loss Contingencies (guidance formerly contained in FASB Statement No. 5). We do not consider these loans in the troubled debt restructuring (TDR) pool. If we applied accounting under ASC 310 40, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (guidance formerly contained in FASB Statement No. 114), to loans in this program, there would not be a material difference in the allowance. Loans for which temporary hardship concessions were granted comprised less than 1% of our total credit card loans at November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009. In contrast to temporary hardship concessions, our permanent workout programs entail more significant and permanent concessions including changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months. The concessions associated with a permanent workout also include a significant reduction in interest rate and possible waivers of unpaid interest and fees. We account for permanent workout loans as TDRs and, as a result, we measure impairment of these loans based on the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be received on them. Loans in permanent workout programs comprised less than 1% of our total credit card loans at November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009. We also participate in consumer credit counseling agency (CCCA) programs in an effort to assist customers to proactively manage their credit card balances. The vast majority of loans entering CCCA programs are not delinquent at the time of enrollment, and our charge off rate on these loans is comparable or less than the rate on our overall credit card receivables portfolio. These loans continue to be subject to original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. In assessing the appropriate allowance for loan loss, these loans are included in the general pool of credit card loans with the allowance determined under the contingent loss model. We do not consider these loans in the TDR pool. If we applied TDR accounting to loans in this program, there would not be a material difference in the allowance. Credit card loans modified under CCCA programs comprised approximately 1.7% of our total credit card loans at both November 30, 2010 and November 30, 2009.

(2) Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $738 million, $670 million and $710 million for the years ended November 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total other income decreased in the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted as lower loan fees and other income were partially offset by higher revenues from discount and interchange, transaction processing revenue and a $19.6 million gain relating to the liquidation of collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key. These key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below. 77 Table of Contents Total other income decreased slightly for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2008 as adjusted. This is primarily attributable to a decrease in loan fee income partially offset by increases in fee product income and lower losses on investment securities. These key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below. Discount and Interchange Revenue Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. We earn acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by credit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organizations transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain customers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customers purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. In 2010 we had higher sales volume than 2009, which was the key driver of the increase in discount and interchange revenue. In total, our gross discount and interchange revenue increased by $140 million for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, which was partially offset by a $68 million increase in Cashback Bonus rewards earned by our customers. Discount and interchange revenue increased slightly for the year ended November 30, 2009, as adjusted compared to the year ended November 30, 2008, as adjusted, due to lower customer rewards costs, partially offset by lower revenues earned on lower sales volume. Lower customer rewards costs were due to a decline in sales volume, partially offset by adjustments made in the third quarter of 2008 to the rewards liability for an increase in expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. Fee Products We earn revenue related to fees received for selling ancillary products and services including debt deferment/debt cancellation and identity theft protection services to customers. The amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customers outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized over the agreement or contract period as earned. Fee products income increased slightly for the year ended November 30, 2010, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted primarily due to an increase in revenue from our identity theft protection product. Fee products income increased for the year ended November 30, 2009 as adjusted, as compared to the year ended 2008 as adjusted, largely due to an increase in the revenue from our debt deferment/debt cancellation product and from our identity theft protection product. Additionally, fee products income increased in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to higher balances upon which the fees are based. Loan Fee Income Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, cash advance, pay by phone and other miscellaneous fees. However, effective February 2010, as a result of legislative changes, we no longer charge overlimit or pay by phone fees on consumer credit card loans. The legislative changes also resulted in changes to our late fee policy beginning August 2010. In 2010, loan fee income decreased substantially as compared to 2009 as adjusted, primarily due to the legislative changes mentioned above. We had a minimal level of overlimit fees in 2010 as compared to $82 million in 2009 as adjusted, which was the last year in which we charged overlimit fees throughout the entire year (overlimit fees were $44 million in 2009 on a GAAP basis). Additionally, our late fee income declined by $45 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted. This was due in part to the legislative changes mentioned above, but also due to a higher level of late payment incidences in 2009 as a result of the credit environment at that time. In 2009 as adjusted, loan fee income decreased as compared to 2008 as adjusted, primarily due to deferrals of balance transfer fees and higher charge offs and adjustments of loan fees, partially offset by an increase in income from late fees as discussed above. 78 Table of Contents Merchant Fees To broaden merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards, we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late 2006. We have also sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and to reduce costs. As we have moved away from direct merchant relationships, our merchant fee income and related costs have declined from $67 million in 2008 to $44 million in 2009 and $28 million in 2010. The lower income per transaction is generally offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance. Transaction Processing Revenue Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing ATM, debit and point of sale transactions over the PULSE network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. Transaction processing revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009, due to higher transaction volumes and higher margins at PULSE. Transaction processing revenue increased for 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to increased volumes partially offset by pricing incentives offered to financial institutions, which are accounted for as an offset to transaction processing revenue. Gain/Loss on Investment Securities Gain/loss on investment securities includes realized gains and losses on the sale of investments as well as any write downs of investment securities to fair value when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary. During the year ended November 30, 2010, we recorded a gain of $19.6 million relating to the liquidation of collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key. The investment was originally purchased in 2007 for $120.1 million, subsequently written down to $51.3 million, largely as a result of other than temporary impairment of $8.2 million and $49.1 million recorded in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In August 2010, this investment was liquidated for $70.9 million. See additional information in Note 5: Investment Securities to our consolidated financial statements. Other Income Other income includes royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third party issuers on the Discover Network and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income decreased in both 2010 and 2009 as adjusted as compared to the prior year periods. In 2010 and 2009 as adjusted, revenue from the referral of declined applications to third party issuers was lower as compared to the prior years due to a lower level of acquisition activity. In 2010, other income also included a loss of $23 million related to our decision in 2010 to sell our remaining federal student loans. In 2009 as adjusted, other income was higher than 2008 as adjusted due to the inclusion of a full year of Diners Club revenue as compared to a half year in 2008 (Diners Club was acquired on June 30, 2008). Other Expense The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2010 vs. 2009increase (decrease) 2009 vs. 2008increase (decrease) 2010 2009 (As Adjusted1) 2008 $ % $ % Employee compensation and benefits $ 802,649 $ 827,683 $ 845,392 $ (25,034 ) (3 %) $ (17,709 ) (2 %) Marketing and business development 463,086 406,020 530,901 57,066 14 % (124,881 ) (24 %) Information processing and communications 258,111 289,209 315,943 (31,098 ) (11 %) (26,734 ) (8 %) Professional fees 342,648 321,329 349,484 21,319 7 % (28,155 ) (8 %) Premises and equipment 70,274 73,014 80,394 (2,740 ) (4 %) (7,380 ) (9 %) Other expense 245,897 304,841 293,683 (58,944 ) (19 %) 11,158 4 % Total other expense $ 2,182,665 $ 2,222,096 $ 2,415,797 $ (39,431 ) (2 %) $ (193,701 ) (8 %) (1) See Reconciliations of GAAP to As Adjusted Data. 79 Table of Contents Total other expense decreased $39 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 as adjusted. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased as we benefitted from cost containment initiatives undertaken in 2009, which included lowering headcount. Information processing and communications expense was lower in 2010 than in 2009 due to our efforts to reduce costs associated with ongoing contracts. Other expense was lower in 2010 due to (i) a $29 million nonrecurring benefit related to the reversal of expense that had been recorded related to the payment to Morgan Stanley under an amendment to the special dividend agreement (see Note 21: Litigation to our consolidated financial statements); (ii) a $20 million restructuring charge recorded during the second quarter 2009 as a result of the reduction in headcount and (iii) a $14 million decline in costs relating to fraud. These declines in expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses, due to increased advertising and promotional marketing expenses and higher investments in account acquisition, and an increase in professional fees, due to higher collection fees and advisory expenses related to the acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation. Total other expense decreased $194 million in 2009 as adjusted as compared to 2008. Expenses were lower overall reflecting the impact of cost containment initiatives such as a reduction of headcount, lower marketing and lower litigation expense. Marketing expenses decreased $125 million primarily due to a reduction in new account acquisition. Other expense increased $11 million due to the inclusion of a full year of Diners Club expenses compared to only six months in 2008, a $20 million charge related to a reduction in force, increased costs associated with the global expansion initiative and a charge related to a facility closure. Additionally, in 2008, other expense included a $39 million benefit due to the curtailment of our pension plan. These increases in other expense were partially offset by lower postage, supplies and credit bureau fees resulting from lower account acquisition activity and fraud costs. Income Tax Expense For 2010, we had tax expense of $504 million as compared to a tax benefit of $92 million for 2009 as adjusted. The increase was the result of shifting from an as adjusted pretax loss position in 2009 to a pretax income position in 2010. 2010 also includes $49.9 million of state tax expense which is attributable to an increase in pretax income and tax liabilities in additional states. For 2009 as adjusted, we had a $92 million tax benefit as compared to tax expense of $150 million in 2008 as adjusted, as a result of shifting from an as adjusted pretax income position in 2008 to a pretax loss position in 2009. Included in 2009 was a $24 million valuation allowance on a tax benefit arising from the sale of the Goldfish business in 2008 that we no longer believed was realizable. 2009 also had a higher effective state tax rate due to estimated taxes payable in additional states. Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding and Liquidity We seek to maintain diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations. In addition, we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile, utilize a cost effective mix of funding sources and ensure that the composition of our funding sources provides appropriate diversification. Our primary funding sources include deposits, sourced directly from consumers or through brokers, term asset backed securitizations, private asset backed securitizations and long term borrowings. Funding Sources Deposits. We offer deposit products, including certificates of deposit, money market accounts, online savings accounts and Individual Retirement Account (IRA) certificates of deposit, to customers through two channels: (i) through direct marketing, internet origination and affinity relationships (direct to consumer deposits); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms (brokered deposits). Since November 30, 2009, direct to consumer deposits have grown $8.0 billion, or 64%, which includes approximately $1 billion of deposit accounts acquired in March 2010 from a third party. At November 30, 2010, we had $20.6 billion of direct to consumer deposits and $13.7 billion of brokered deposits Since November 30, 2009, we have deemphasized the brokered deposit channel in favor of our direct to consumer deposit program. Remaining maturities of our certificates of deposit range from one month to ten years, with a weighted average maturity of 22 months at November 30, 2010. 80 Table of Contents The following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity as of November 30, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Total Three Monthsor Less Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths Over TwelveMonths Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000(1) $ 19,797,420 $ 1,366,419 $ 2,032,944 $ 3,813,641 $ 12,584,416 Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 to less than $250,000(1) 4,626,792 551,400 459,137 1,226,451 2,389,804 Certificates of deposit in amounts of $250,000(1) or greater 1,146,843 177,905 138,962 336,010 493,966 Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts 8,738,784 8,738,784 Total interest bearing deposits $ 34,309,839 $ 10,834,508 $ 2,631,043 $ 5,376,102 $ 15,468,186 (1) $100,000 represents the basic insurance amount previously covered by the FDIC. Effective July 21, 2010, the basic insurance per depositor was permanently increased to $250,000. Credit Card Securitization Financing. We use the securitization of credit card receivables as an additional source of funding. We access the asset backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT) and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT), through which we issue asset backed securities both publicly and through private transactions. The DCMT structure utilizes Class A and Class B certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates, cash collateral accounts (discussed below) and subordinated Series 2009 CE. The DCENT structure utilizes four classes of securities with declining levels of seniority (Class A, B, C and D), with credit enhancement provided by the more subordinated classes of notes. Both DCMT and DCENT are further enhanced by Series 2009 SD through its provisions to reallocate principal cash flows, thereby enhancing the excess spread, discussed below, of both trusts. We retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of subordinated security classes of DCMT and DCENT. The cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to certain DCMT certificates were $459 million at November 30, 2010 and were recorded in restricted cash for securitization investors in our consolidated statement of financial condition. These cash collateral accounts were partially funded through a loan facility entered into between a consolidated special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, and third party lenders. At November 30, 2010, $306 million of the DRFC Funding LLC facility was outstanding and was recorded in long term borrowings in our consolidated statement of financial condition. This loan facility was repaid on December 15, 2010. The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as economic early amortization, which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, as well as the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from Series 2009 SD exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three month rolling average, we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings over a period of months using all available collections received by the trust (the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received). An early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity, and require us to utilize our available contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. As of November 30, 2010, the 3 month rolling average excess spread was 13.46%. Another feature of our securitization structure, which is applicable only to the notes issued from DCENT, is a reserve account funding requirement in which excess cash flows generated by the transferred loan receivables are held at the trust. This funding requirement is triggered when DCENTs three month average excess spread rate decreases to below 4.50%, with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels to 0%. See Note 7: 81 Table of Contents Credit Card Securitization Activities to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the structures of DCMT and DCENT and for tables providing information concerning investors interests and related excess spreads at November 30, 2010. At November 30, 2010, we had $14.5 billion of outstanding public asset backed securities, $0.5 billion of outstanding private asset backed securitizations and $4.6 billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries. The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries at November 30, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years After FiveYears Scheduled maturities of long term borrowings owed to securitization investors $ 14,919,400 $ 4,825,919 $ 7,504,684 $ 1,589,113 $ 999,684 At November 30, 2010, we had capacity to issue up to $4.7 billion in triple A rated asset backed securities from DCENT without the issuance of additional Class B or Class C notes as subordination. The triple A rating of DCENT Class A Notes issued to date has been based, in part, on an FDIC rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not, using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Pursuant to amendments to GAAP related to transfers of financial assets, effective for us on December 1, 2009, certain transfers of assets that previously qualified for sale accounting treatment under GAAP no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment. However, on September 27, 2010, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts as long as the securitizations would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 1, 2009. Other legislative and regulatory developments, namely the proposed SEC Regulation AB II, the securitization and rating agency provisions of the Reform Act and the federal banking agencies notice regarding their consideration of replacement of the ratings based approach for assessing capital charges against securitization exposures, may, however, impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future. See Legislative and Regulatory Developments Asset Backed Securities Regulations for additional information. Short Term Borrowings. Short term borrowings include any debt or time deposits with original maturities of 12 months or less. We primarily access short term borrowings through the Federal Funds market or through repurchase agreements. In the past two years, we have rarely used short term borrowings. In fiscal year 2010, we entered into one overnight repurchase agreement for $50 million. At November 30, 2010 we had no outstanding short term borrowings. However, in December 2010, we entered into one overnight repurchase agreement for $48 million and began accessing the Federal Funds market. The level of short term borrowings used by us in the future will depend on our liquidity needs and market conditions. Long Term Borrowings. At November 30, 2010, we had $0.8 billion of senior unsecured notes outstanding, reflecting two issuances of $400 million each of fixed rate senior unsecured notes, one maturing in June 2017 and the other maturing in July 2019. These notes would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. As of November 30, 2010, Discover Bank had a total of $1.2 billion in principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding, which included $700 million due in November 2019 and $500 million due in April 2020. ECASLA. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (as amended, ECASLA) provides originators of Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans with a cost effective source of funding and liquidity with respect to qualifying FFELP loans. On April 12, 2010, Discover Bank financed $0.5 billion of eligible FFELP loans through an agreement with Straight A Funding, LLC, an asset backed commercial paper conduit sponsored by the U.S. 82 Table of Contents Department of Education (DOE) under ECASLA, which matures August 2013. The FFELP loans that secure this funding arrangement were classified as held for sale as of November 30, 2010. This funding will be repaid upon the sale of the financed loans. The Student Loan Corporation Acquisition. On December 31, 2010, we acquired The Student Loan Corporation (SLC) in a merger transaction in which we acquired approximately $4.2 billion of private student loans and other assets, along with assuming approximately $3.4 billion of SLCs existing asset backed securitization debt funding and other liabilities. The acquisition significantly increased the size of our private student loan portfolio and long term borrowings owed to securitization investors. Additional Funding Sources Private Asset Backed Securitizations. We have access to committed undrawn capacity through privately placed asset backed securitizations to support the funding of our credit card loan receivables. Under these arrangements, we had used $0.5 billion of capacity and had an undrawn capacity of $3.3 billion at November 30, 2010. Unsecured Committed Credit Facility. Our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.4 billion is available through May 2012. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank (Discover Financial Services may borrow up to 30% and Discover Bank may borrow up to 100% of the total commitment). The facility is available to support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short term funding needs from time to time. The terms of the credit facility include various affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants related to the maintenance of certain capitalization and tangible net worth levels, and certain double leverage, delinquency and tier 1 capital to managed loans ratios. The credit facility also includes customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross defaults to other agreements evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money and bankruptcy related defaults. The facility may be terminated upon an event of default. We have no outstanding balances due under the facility. Federal Reserve. Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias discount window. As of November 30, 2010, Discover Bank had $8.2 billion of available capacity through the discount window based on the amount of assets pledged. We have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of Discover Financial Services, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations, as well as potentially higher fees related to borrowings under our lines of credit. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets. We also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require Discover Banks debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies. If Discover Banks credit rating is reduced to below investment grade, we would be required to post additional collateral, which, as of November 30, 2010, would have been $31 million. 83 Table of Contents A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The credit ratings are summarized in the following table: DiscoverFinancialServices DiscoverBank Outlookfor SeniorUnsecured Debt DiscoverBank Discover CardMaster Trust I Discover Card ExecutionNote Trust SeniorUnsecuredDebt SeniorUnsecuredDebt SubordinatedDebt Class A(1) Class B Class A(1) Class B Class C Moodys Investors Service Ba1 Baa3 Stable Ba1 Aaa(sf) A1(sf) Aaa(sf) A1(sf) Baa1(sf) Standard & Poors BBB BBB Stable BBB AAA(SF) AA+(SF) AAA(SF) AA+(SF) A+(SF) Fitch Ratings BBB BBB Stable BBB AAAsf AAsf AAAsf AA sf A sf (1) An sf in the rating denotes an identification for structured finance product ratings that was implemented for these products by the rating agencies as of September 2010. Several rating agencies have announced that they will be evaluating the effects of the Reform Act that was enacted in July 2010 in order to determine the extent, if any, to which financial institutions, including us, may be negatively impacted. While we are currently unaware of any negative actions, there is no assurance that our credit ratings could not be downgraded in the future as a result of any such reviews. See Legislative and Regulatory Developments for information regarding the Reform Act. Liquidity We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations. In the assessment of our liquidity needs, we also evaluate a range of stress events that would impact our access to normal funding sources, cash needs and or liquidity. We maintain contingent funding sources, including our liquidity investment portfolio, private securitizations with unused capacity, committed credit facility capacity and Federal Reserve discount window capacity, which we could seek to utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events. We expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during the next 12 months by utilizing our deposit channels and our contingent funding sources. We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across the company, which is the responsibility of the Asset and Liability Committee (the ALCO). We seek to balance the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may limit financial flexibility and be costly, with having too little liquidity that could cause financial distress. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the ALCO, which is chaired by our CFO and has cross functional membership. The ALCO monitors positions and determines any actions that need to be taken. At November 30, 2010, our liquidity investment portfolio was comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high quality, liquid investments. Cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in deposits with the Federal Reserve and AAA rated government money market mutual funds. Investments included highly rated certificates of deposit, credit card asset backed securities of other issuers plus U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency and AAA rated corporate debt obligations issued under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program that are guaranteed by the FDIC, all of which are considered highly liquid. In addition, we have the ability to raise cash through utilizing repurchase agreements and pledging certain of these investments. The level of our liquidity investment portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions. 84 Table of Contents At November 30, 2010, our liquidity investment portfolio was $10.1 billion, which was $4.4 billion lower than the balance at November 30, 2009 due to funding of maturities of primarily asset backed securities in the first half 2010. Our undrawn credit facility capacity has increased since November 30, 2009 by $3.7 billion, primarily due to the net addition of $1.8 billion of private securitization capacity and through a $1.9 billion increase in collateral pledged to the Federal Reserve discount window.

Capital Our primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by our businesses and issuances in the capital markets. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency guidelines and support future business growth. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives, and legislative and regulatory developments. See Legislative and Regulatory Developments International Initiatives Related to Capital and Liquidity for a discussion of recent initiatives related to capital matters. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies, we, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum levels of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results. We must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. We maintain a substantial deferred tax asset on our balance sheet, and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels. However, for regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income are currently limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets we expect to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date, based on our projected future taxable income for that year; or (ii) 10% of the amount of our Tier 1 capital. At November 30, 2010, no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. At November 30, 2010, Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank met the requirements for well capitalized status, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject. See Note 19: Capital Adequacy to our consolidated financial statements for quantitative disclosures of our capital ratios and levels. Recent regulatory initiatives may subject us to increased capital requirements in the future. See Legislative and Regulatory Developments International Initiatives Related to Capital and Liquidity. 85 Table of Contents Equity Capital. At November 30, 2010, equity was $6.4 billion as compared to $8.4 billion at November 30, 2009. The decline in equity is the result of adopting Statements No. 166 and 167 in the first quarter 2010, which reduced equity by $1.3 billion, and redeeming all outstanding shares of the preferred stock that had previously been issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program in the second quarter 2010, which reduced equity by $1.2 billion. On July 7, 2010, we repurchased the warrant to purchase 20,500,413 shares of our common stock that we issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the issuance of our preferred stock. We repurchased the warrant from the U.S. Treasury for $172 million. Dividends. Our board of directors declared a dividend of $.02 per share in each quarter of 2010. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends in the future. In addition, our banking regulators and applicable banking laws and regulations may limit our ability to pay dividends. Further, as a result of provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited. Guarantees Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. See Note 20: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees. Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2010 include deposits, long term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2010 are summarized below (dollars in thousands): Payments Due By Period Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years More ThanFive Years Deposits(1) $ 34,413,383 $ 18,945,197 $ 11,046,925 $ 3,787,177 $ 634,084 Long term borrowings(2) 17,705,340 5,132,235 7,997,594 1,589,113 2,986,398 Capital lease obligations 395 395 Operating leases 38,884 5,843 11,216 9,732 12,093 Interest payments on fixed rate debt 1,943,815 279,638 505,494 438,400 720,283 Purchase obligations(3) 497,607 220,485 181,595 91,163 4,364 Other long term liabilities(4) 166,146 13,274 28,027 30,223 94,622 Total contractual obligations $ 54,765,570 $ 24,597,067 $ 19,770,851 $ 5,945,808 $ 4,451,844 (1) Deposits do not include interest charges. (2) See Note 11: Long Term Borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate notes is estimated to be $163 million as of November 30, 2010, utilizing the current interest rates as of that date. (3) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license and telecommunications agreements. Purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2010 reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition. (4) Other long term liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans. As of November 30, 2010 our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $373 million, and approximately $68 million of accrued interest and penalties. Since the ultimate amount and 86 Table of Contents timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated income tax obligations about which there is uncertainty, as addressed in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, (guidance formerly provided by FASB Interpretation No. 48), have been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 17: Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our tax obligations. We extend credit for consumer and commercial loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. During 2010, our unused commitments were reduced by $7 billion to $165 billion at November 30, 2010, as part of our risk management strategies. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. Interest Rate Risk. We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers, as well as invest in other assets and our business. These loans and other assets earn interest, which we use to pay interest on the money borrowed. Our net interest income and, therefore, earnings, will be negatively affected if the interest rate earned on assets increases at a slower pace than increases to the interest rate we owe on our borrowings. Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to those changes may influence customer payment rates, loan balances or deposit account activity. We may face higher cost alternative sources of funding as a result, which has the potential to decrease earnings. Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the mix of variable and fixed rate assets. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate. See Note 23: Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivatives activity. We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree. Our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity investment portfolio. Due to recently enacted credit card legislation, we now have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances. At November 30, 2010, the majority of our credit card loans were at variable rates. Beginning in the third quarter 2010, we began using interest rate derivatives to reduce the asset sensitivity that resulted from having a larger percentage of our loan portfolio at variable rates. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the 87 Table of Contents full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses. Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2010, we estimate that net interest income over the following 12 month period would increase by approximately $50 million, or 1%. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2009 we estimated that net interest income over the following 12 month period would increase by approximately $84 million, or 2%. The decline in the estimated impact of an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at November 30, 2010 as compared to November 30, 2009, was primarily driven by reducing the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet through the use of interest rate derivatives. Specifically, beginning in the third quarter 2010, we entered into interest rate derivative agreements under which we receive a fixed interest rate on forecasted cash flows related to variable rate credit card receivables. We anticipate that the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet will be reduced further with continued management of our balance sheet sensitivity and through the use of derivatives. We have not provided an estimate of any impact on net interest income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels and, therefore, could not materially decrease further. 88 Table of Contents
