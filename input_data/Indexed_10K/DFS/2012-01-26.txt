Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis constitutes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10 K particularly under Risk Factors and Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements, which immediately follows Risk Factors. Unless otherwise specified, references to Notes to our consolidated financial statements are to the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of November 30, 2011 and 2010 and for the three year period ended November 30, 2011. Introduction and OverviewDiscover Financial Services is a direct banking and payment services company. Through our Discover Bank subsidiary, we offer our customers credit cards, student loans, personal loans and deposit products. Through our DFS Services LLC subsidiary and its subsidiaries, we operate the Discover Network, the PULSE Network (PULSE) and Diners Club International (Diners Club). The Discover Network is a payment card transaction processing network for Discover card branded and third party issued credit, debit and prepaid cards. PULSE operates an electronic funds transfer network, providing financial institutions issuing debit cards on the PULSE Network with access to ATMs domestically and internationally, as well as point of sale terminals at retail locations throughout the U.S. for debit card transactions. Diners Club is a global payments network of licensees, which are generally financial institutions, that issue Diners Club branded credit cards and or provide card acceptance services. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year.Our primary revenues consist of interest income earned on loan receivables and fees earned from customers, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provisions, customer rewards, and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables and networks. Our business activities are funded primarily through consumer deposits, securitization of loan receivables and the issuance of both secured and unsecured debt.Change in Accounting Principle Related to Off Balance Sheet Securitizations Beginning with the first quarter 2010, we have included the trusts used in our securitization activities in our consolidated financial results in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (Statement No. 166) (codified under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Section 860, Transfers and Servicing) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretations No. 46(R) (Statement No. 167) (codified under ASC Section 810, Consolidation), which were effective for us on December 1, 2009, the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year. Under Statement No. 166, the trusts used in our securitization transactions are no longer exempt from consolidation. Statement No. 167 prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated in our financial statements. Based on our assessment, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT) and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT) (the trusts) and accordingly, we began consolidating the trusts on December 1, 2009. Using the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by Statement No. 167, we recorded a $21.1 billion increase in total assets, a $22.4 billion increase in total liabilities and a $1.3 billion decrease in stockholders equity (comprised of a $1.4 billion decrease in retained earnings offset by an increase of $0.1 billion in accumulated other comprehensive income). The significant adjustments to our statement of financial condition upon adoption of Statements No. 166 and 167 are outlined below: Consolidation of $22.3 billion of securitized loan receivables and the related debt issued from the trusts to third party investors; Reclassification of $4.6 billion of certificated retained interests classified as investment securities to loan receivables; Recording of a $2.1 billion allowance for loan losses, not previously required under GAAP, for the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables; Derecognition of the remaining $0.1 billion value of the interest only strip receivable, net of tax, recorded in amounts due from asset securitization and reclassification of the remaining $1.6 billion of amounts due from asset securitization to restricted cash, loan receivables and other assets; and Recording of net deferred tax assets of $0.8 billion, largely related to establishing an allowance for loan losses on the newly consolidated and reclassified credit card loan receivables. 44Table of ContentsBeginning with the first quarter 2010, our results of operations no longer reflect securitization income, but instead report interest income, net charge offs and certain other income associated with all securitized loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors in the same line items in our results of operations as non securitized credit card loan receivables and corporate debt. Additionally, we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans no longer receive sale accounting treatment. Also, there are no gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable as that asset is not recognizable in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing. Because our securitization transactions are being accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales, the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities. Notwithstanding this accounting treatment, our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables from Discover Bank, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts, even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in the assets of these trusts. Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data To enable the reader to better understand our financial information by reflecting period over period data on a consistent basis, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations presents our financial information as of and for the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010 as compared to non GAAP as adjusted results of operations data for the year ended November 30, 2009, and, where necessary, we have also provided certain information as of and for the year ended November 30, 2008 and 2007 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. Management believes the non GAAP as adjusted financial information is useful to investors as it aligns with the financial information used in managements decision making process and in evaluating the business. The following describes the adjustments made to arrive at the non GAAP as adjusted financial information: Settlement income adjustments The non GAAP as adjusted amounts remove the impact of income received in connection with the settlement of our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard during the years ended November 30, 2009 and 2008, which resulted in unusually large amounts in other income and affect comparability of results between periods.Special dividend interest adjustments The non GAAP as adjusted amounts exclude the 2009 interest charge related to our dispute with Morgan Stanley regarding the special dividend agreement, which, among other things, specified how proceeds of the antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard were to be shared.Statements No. 166 and 167 adjustments The non GAAP as adjusted amounts show how our financial data would have been presented if the trusts used in our securitization activities were consolidated into our financial statements for historical periods prior to fiscal year 2010.We did not retrospectively adopt Statements No. 166 and 167 and, therefore, the consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report as of and for the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010 reflect the new accounting requirements, but the historical statement of income and statement of cash flows for the year ended November 30, 2009 continue to reflect the accounting applicable prior to the adoption of the new accounting requirements. The impacts of Statements No. 166 and 167 on our earnings summary, detail of other income and Direct Banking segment information are reflected in two steps in the reconciliations of GAAP to non GAAP as adjusted data in the tables below. First, we made securitization adjustments to reverse the effect of loan securitization by recharacterizing securitization income to report interest income, interest expense, provision for loan losses, discount and interchange revenue and loan fee income in the same line items as non securitized loans. These adjustments result in a managed basis presentation, which we have historically included in our quarterly and annual reports to reflect the way in which our senior management evaluated our business performance and allocated resources. Then, in addition to the adjustments to remove the litigation settlement income and the interest related to the special dividend paid to Morgan Stanley, adjustments were made to reflect results as if the trusts used in our securitization activities had been fully consolidated in our historical results. These adjustments include: Elimination of interest income and interest expense related to certificated retained interests classified as investment securities and associated intercompany debt;An adjustment to the provision for loan losses for the change in securitized loan receivables;Elimination of the revaluation gains or losses associated with the interest only strip receivable, which was derecognized upon adoption of Statements No. 166 and 167; and An adjustment to reflect the income tax effects related to these adjustments.45Table of ContentsThe impacts of Statements No. 166 and 167 on our effective tax rate, loan receivables and average balance sheet information and certain other selected financial data are reflected in one step, rather than two, in the reconciliations of GAAP to non GAAP as adjusted data set forth in the tables below as there is no meaningful difference between such information on a historical managed basis as compared to on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. The following tables display a reconciliation between GAAP, previously reported managed results, and non GAAP as adjusted amounts that reflect the exclusion of litigation settlement proceeds and interest related to the Morgan Stanley special dividend, which were unrelated to the adoption of Statements No. 166 and 167, and reflect the full impact the consolidation of our trusts would have had if we had adopted Statements No. 166 and 167 retrospectively.

year growth of 8% totaling $100.1 billion in 2011 as compared to $92.5 billion in 2010. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in spending by both new and existing customers partially due to increased marketing.The delinquency rate for our credit card loans over 30 days past due improved dramatically during 2011, reaching an all time low at November 30, 2011 of 2.39%, which was down from the prior year rate of 4.06%. The primary reason for this decline was the improvement throughout 2011 in the underlying credit quality of our portfolio as the U.S. economy stabilized following an extended period of increasing unemployment levels. Our total loan portfolio increased 18% year over year to $56.6 billion, mainly due to the acquisition of The Student Loan Corporation ("SLC") in December 2010, which added approximately $3.1 billion of private student loans to our portfolio, and the acquisition of approximately $2.4 billion of private student loans from Citibank, N.A. ("Citi") in September 2011. In addition, $1.5 billion is attributed to an increase in credit card loans due to higher volumes and lower charge offs.Payment Services continued to produce strong results with pretax income of $166 million, up 18% over the prior year. Transaction volume for the segment was $177 billion, an increase of 16% as compared to the prior year. We repurchased 18 million shares, or approximately 3%, of our outstanding common stock for $425 million in 2011. 2010 and 2009 Highlights Our revenues were unfavorably impacted in 2010 by the implementation of certain provisions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the "CARD" Act), which included limitations on our ability to reprice accounts, the elimination of overlimit fees and a reduction in the amount of standard late fees.We settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion in 2008. Through 2009, we received a total of $1.9 billion ($1.2 billion after tax) from Visa for its portion of the settlement. At the time of our spin off, we entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared, among other things. In 2010, we paid Morgan Stanley a dividend of $775 million under an amendment to that agreement. Recent DevelopmentsOn December 9, 2011, we entered into definitive agreements to sell substantially all of our remaining $714 million of federal student loans currently classified as loans held for sale. The majority of these loans were pledged as collateral against a long term borrowing and, as part of this transaction, these borrowings are expected to be assumed by the purchaser. These transactions, which are subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of governmental approvals, are expected to close in February 2012. Effective December 16, 2011, we terminated our $2.4 billion unsecured committed credit facility. This facility had no borrowings against it as of November 30, 2011. For more information, see " Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Management."On January 19, 2012, we paid a dividend of $0.10 per share of our common stock, which was an increase from the $0.06 per share dividend that we paid in the previous quarter.OutlookCredit performance continued to improve through 2011 as we approached historical lows in delinquency and net charge off rates. In 2012, we do not expect reserve releases to continue at previous levels and we anticipate that growth in our loan portfolio will lead to increases in loan loss reserves. We are focused on growing our card receivables in 2012 through new account acquisitions and wallet share gains resulting from marketing and advertising efforts as well as increased acceptance by merchants in the U.S. and major international destinations for U.S. travelers. We are also targeting solid growth and strong returns in our private student and personal loan portfolios, while continuing to pursue other opportunities to diversify our direct banking business, such as our pending acquisition of the mortgage origination business of Tree.com, Inc. We anticipate further total yield compression in 2012 due to the continuing effects of CARD Act implementation, an increase in promotional offers and the expected growth in personal and private student loans, which tend to carry lower interest rates than our card receivables. We expect this yield compression to be somewhat offset by continued funding cost improvements. Funding costs are expected to continue to decline over the next year as we benefit from the interest rate environment and replace higher priced time deposits with lower cost borrowings. Net interest margin is expected to remain relatively stable through 2012. As in 2011, we intend to continue to maintain a strong capital level while targeting investments for future growth and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program. 53Table of ContentsOur payments business had strong volume growth in 2011. We continue to focus on investments to build brand awareness and acceptance globally through support of our Diners Club network and arrangements with other networks and merchant acquirers. Recently, we have been successful in developing relationships with leading merchant acquirers in key markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Western Europe, to further increase acceptance and volumes. PULSE, our debit card network, in preparation for the April 1, 2012 effective date of the federal regulations mandating that debit and prepaid card issuers participate in two or more unaffiliated payment networks, has increased its processing capacity for potential additional volume. Regulatory Environment and DevelopmentsOverviewThe 2010 Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act) contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Reform Act addresses risks to the economy and the payments system, especially those posed by large systemically significant financial firms. Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets ("covered companies"), including Discover, are considered systemically significant under the Reform Act and are subject to heightened prudential standards to be established by the Federal Reserve. Certain provisions of the Reform Act that may have a significant impact on us are described in more detail below under the headings " Consumer Financial Services," " Payment Networks," " Capital and Liquidity" and " Asset Backed Securities." The Reform Act also provides for restrictions on and additional disclosure of executive compensation, additional corporate governance requirements and far more stringent requirements with respect to affiliate transactions and mergers and acquisitions. The effect of the Reform Act and other regulatory initiatives on our business and operations could be significant, depending upon final implementing regulations, the actions of our competitors and the behavior of consumers and other marketplace participants. The Reform Act, other legislative and regulatory changes, and enhanced scrutiny by our regulators could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to limit or change our business practices, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, requiring us to invest valuable management time and resources in compliance efforts, imposing additional costs on us, limiting fees we can charge for services, requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements (including those under Basel III), increasing our cost or ability to access the securitization markets for our funding, impacting the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses. For additional information regarding the impact of the Reform Act and other regulatory initiatives on us, see "Risk Factors."Consumer Financial ServicesThe Reform Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), which regulates consumer financial products and services provided by certain financial services providers, including Discover. In July 2011, many consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other agencies transferred to the CFPB. The CFPB is authorized to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Reform Act and other federal consumer financial services laws (including the CARD Act), as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as Discover. State officials are authorized to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB and other requirements of the Reform Act. The CFPB is already engaged in consumer education, supervision, examination and investigatory activities. In late 2011, it began tracking consumer complaints for credit cards and mortgages via an online process that is expected to expand to student loans in 2012. There is significant legislative and regulatory focus on the student loan market, including by the CFPB, which has made the student loan market a priority area of focus. Under the Reform Act, the CFPB and Department of Education (DOE) are required to prepare a report on private education loans and private educational lenders by July 2012 that examines, among other things, the private education loan market; underwriting criteria used by lenders; loan terms, conditions and pricing; consumer protections available to borrowers; and fair lending considerations. The Reform Act also created a "Private Education Ombudsman" within the CFPB to receive and attempt to informally resolve complaints about private student loans, and the CFPB plans to receive such complaints via its online consumer complaint system. In addition, the Obama Administration has made changes to the federal student loan program intended to make college more affordable and make it easier for students to repay their federal student loans. Congress or the Administration may take actions that impact the student loan market in the future, including as a result of the CFPB and DOE study. The possible impact of heightened scrutiny of the student loan market and its participants, including any resulting legislative and regulatory initiatives, is uncertain and may adversely impact the profitability and growth of our private student loan portfolio. 54Table of ContentsOur banking regulators have introduced and continue to introduce new regulations and supervisory guidance and practices in response to the heightened Congressional and regulatory focus on consumer financial services generally, increasing their scrutiny over us and the industry. Also, additional legislative or regulatory action that may impact our businesses may result from the multiple studies mandated under the Reform Act, such as the CFPB and DOE study of private student loans referenced above. We are unable to predict whether any additional changes to statutes or regulations affecting the consumer financial services industry, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future.Payment Networks Certain Reform Act provisions require that interchange fees paid to or charged by payment card issuers on debit card and certain prepaid transactions be reasonable and proportional to the issuers cost in connection with such transactions, as determined by the Federal Reserve. The Reform Act also prohibits debit and prepaid card networks and issuers from requiring debit and prepaid card transactions to be processed solely on a single payment network, or two or more affiliated payment networks. In addition, provisions of the Reform Act prohibit credit/debit network rules that restrict merchants from offering discounts to customers in order to encourage them to use a particular form of payment, or from setting minimum transaction amounts of $10.00 or less for use of credit cards, as long as such merchant practices do not differentiate on the basis of the issuer or network. The Federal Reserve issued final implementing regulations with respect to the interchange fee and routing provisions in June 2011, some of which became effective in October 2011. Regulations mandating that debit and prepaid card issuers participate in two or more unaffiliated payment networks take effect April 1, 2012. Discover Network and PULSE have modified operating rules, interchange fee schedules and existing agreements to ensure consistency with the Reform Act and Federal Reserve implementing regulations. PULSE has increased its processing capacity for potential additional volume. The ultimate impact of these laws and regulations will depend upon the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants. For example, the National Retail Federation, the Food Marketing Institute, the National Association of Convenience Stores and two retailers have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Federal Reserve implementing regulations and, in particular, the interchange fee provisions, on the grounds that, among other things, the Federal Reserve did not properly apply the Reform Act. It is uncertain how PULSEs business practices, network transaction volume, revenue, and prospects for future growth, as well as the debit card market as a whole, may be impacted by the industrys competitive response to these new requirements.Capital and LiquidityConsistent with Reform Act requirements to impose enhanced prudential standards on covered companies, in November 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule requiring covered companies to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve for its review and non objection. A capital plan must include an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over the planning horizon (at least nine quarters, beginning with the quarter preceding the quarter in which the covered company submits its capital plan) that reflects the companys size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations, assuming both expected and stressful conditions. The capital plan must include a calculation of regulatory capital ratios over the planning horizon under expected conditions and under a range of stressed scenarios and discussion of how the company will maintain capital above each minimum capital ratio, including a pro forma Tier 1 common ratio (meaning the ratio of Tier 1 common capital to total risk weighted assets) above 5%, under these scenarios. The instructions accompanying the Federal Reserves final rule regarding capital plans indicate that the Federal Reserve expects covered companies to show that they can achieve readily and without difficulty the ratios required by the Basel III framework as they would come into effect in the United States." "Basel III" refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010 and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements. Implementation of Basel III in the U.S. will require implementing regulations and guidelines by U.S. banking regulators, which may differ in significant ways from the recommendations published by the Basel Committee. It is unclear how U.S. banking regulators will define well capitalized in their implementation of Basel III. We continue to monitor the implementation of Basel III in the U.S. Based on current industry expectations regarding the content of the regulations to be implemented and our capital profile, we currently anticipate that we will be able to meet the regulatory requirements.Under the Federal Reserves final capital plan rule, covered companies with capital plans viewed as unsatisfactory by the Federal Reserve will face limits on their ability to make capital distributions, including share repurchases and dividends. Further, a covered company generally will be required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve to make capital distributions in certain other cases, including if after giving effect to the distribution the covered company would not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio, including a Tier 1 common ratio of at least 5%, the capital distribution would exceed the amount set forth in the covered companys approved capital plan or the Federal Reserve makes certain determinations. A covered company must update and re submit its capital plan to the Federal Reserve within 30 calendar days (subject to extension) if there has been or will be a material change in the companys risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure, and will generally not be able to make a capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve has approved such distribution. 55Table of ContentsIn addition, on December 20, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement Reform Act heightened prudential standards requirements related to risk based capital and leverage; liquidity; single counterparty credit limits; overall risk management and risk committees; stress tests; and a debt to equity limit for covered companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The proposal also includes rules to implement the early remediation requirements in the Reform Act related to establishing measures of financial condition and remediation requirements that increase in stringency as the financial condition of a covered company declines.The capital, leverage and stress test proposals work in tandem with the Federal Reserves annual capital plan requirements by establishing a framework for capital stress testing under which the Federal Reserve would, on an annual basis, conduct an analysis of a covered companys capital, taking into account all relevant exposures and activities of the covered company to evaluate the ability of the covered company to absorb losses and continue to function as a credit intermediary as a result of adverse and severely adverse economic and financial market conditions. The Federal Reserve will conduct its analysis using a minimum of three different sets of economic and financial conditions (scenarios), including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse conditions, and will make public a summary of the results, including company specific information. Further, covered companies will be required to perform one or more company run capital stress tests each year using a baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenario provided by the Federal Reserve as well as a baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenario developed by the covered company, and to make a summary of the results public.In the initial phase, covered companies will be subject to the Federal Reserves capital plan rule, described above, including the requirement to maintain a Tier 1 common ratio greater than 5%. The Federal Reserve states that, in a second phase, it intends to supplement the enhanced risk based capital requirements contained in its capital plan rule with a subsequent proposal to implement a quantitative risk based capital surcharge for covered companies or a subset of covered companies. The quantitative risk based capital surcharge would be based on the Basel Committees approach and implementation timeframe, which contemplates adopting implementing rules in 2014 and requiring global systemically important banks to meet the capital surcharges on a phased in basis from 2016 2019. The Federal Reserve also notes that it and the other U.S. federal banking agencies are continuing to work on implementing the other Basel III capital requirements in the United States but, other than with respect to the capital surcharge, does not provide further details with respect to such implementation.The Federal Reserve proposed rules related to liquidity would subject covered companies to a set of enhanced liquidity risk management standards, including liquidity stress testing. The proposal would require covered companies to conduct internal stress tests at least monthly to measure their liquidity needs during times of instability in the financial markets and to hold highly liquid assets that would be sufficient to cover 30 day stressed net cash outflows under their internal stress scenarios. Covered companies also would be required to meet specified corporate governance requirements around liquidity risk management, to project cash flow needs over various time horizons, to establish internal limits on certain liquidity metrics, and to maintain a contingency funding plan that identifies potential sources of liquidity strain and alternative sources of funding when usual sources of liquidity are unavailable. The Federal Reserve indicates that, in a second phase, it and the other U.S. federal banking agencies plan to issue one or more proposals to implement quantitative liquidity requirements based on Basel III that would be applicable to all or a subset of covered companies. On January 17, 2012, the FDIC approved a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the provisions of the Reform Act that require state nonmember banks with consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, such as Discover Bank, to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests. In terms of its requirements, the notice of proposed rulemaking is substantively similar to the Federal Reserves December 20, 2011 proposed rules described above. Also on January 17, 2012, the FDIC approved a final rule requiring an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as Discover Bank, to submit to the FDIC periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institutions failure. This final rule follows an interim final rule relating to insured depository institution resolution plans and separate joint rulemaking with the Federal Reserve that the FDIC approved in September 2011 pursuant to Section 165(d) of the Reform Act requiring bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets (including us) and certain other financial companies to submit a resolution plan (or so called living will) to the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council for their rapid and orderly liquidation in the event of material financial distress or failure. The FDICs final rule and the separate joint rulemaking rules are meant to be complementary and use the same staggered submission schedule. Under the rules, the initial resolution plans for us and Discover Bank are required to be submitted on or before December 31, 2013. Thereafter, we and Discover Bank are required to update such plans annually and, in certain circumstances, more frequently.Asset Backed SecuritiesThe Reform Act also imposes a number of significant changes relating to the asset backed securities and structured finance markets, some of which may impact our ability and or desire to utilize those markets to meet funding and liquidity needs. For more information regarding these and other changes related to asset backed securities that may impact us, see "Risk Factors If we are unable to securitize our receivables, it may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cost of funds and overall financial condition," " Liquidity and Capital Resources Funding Sources Credit Card Securitization Financing" and " Liquidity and Capital Resources Credit Ratings." 56Table of ContentsResults of Operations The discussion below provides a summary of our results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2011, compared to our results of operations for the year ended November 30, 2010, and for the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. The discussion also provides information about our loan receivables as of November 30, 2011, compared to November 30, 2010, and November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. In certain tables, quantitative information about our loan receivables as of November 30, 2008 and 2007 are also shown on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. For a reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP as adjusted financial data, see Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data. All information and comparisons are based solely on continuing operations. SegmentsWe manage our business activities in two segments: Direct Banking and Payment Services. In compiling the segment results that follow, our Direct Banking segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by our Payment Services segment.Direct Banking. Our Direct Banking segment includes Discover card branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses and other consumer banking products and services, including personal loans, student loans, prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary. The majority of our Direct Banking revenues relate to interest income earned on each of our loan products. Additionally, our credit card products generate substantially all of our revenues related to discount and interchange, fee products and loan fee income.Payment Services. Our Payment Services segment includes PULSE, an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and our third party issuing business, which includes credit, debit and prepaid cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties. The majority of our Payment Services revenues relate to transaction processing revenue from PULSE and royalty and licensee revenue (included in other income) from Diners Club.57Table of ContentsThe following table presents segment data (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended November 30, 2011 2010 2009Direct Banking(1) Interest income Credit card$5,654,088 $5,836,002 $6,169,302Private student loans115,307 47,518 25,906PCI student loans225,096 Personal loans266,081 181,652 139,247Other84,529 81,027 99,599Total interest income6,345,101 6,146,199 6,434,054Interest expense1,484,335 1,582,745 1,605,277Net interest income4,860,766 4,563,454 4,828,777Provision for loan losses1,013,350 3,206,705 5,123,030Other income1,907,322 1,827,414 1,946,270Other expense2,409,584 2,056,685 2,087,970Income before income tax expense3,345,154 1,127,478 (435,953)Payment Services Interest income38 19 1,098Interest expense217 243 222Net interest expense(179) (224) 876Provision for loan losses Other income297,852 267,585 239,794Other expense131,583 125,980 134,126Income before income tax expense166,090 141,381 106,544Total income before income tax expense$3,511,244 $1,268,859 $(329,409) (1)The 2009 Direct Banking segment information is presented on a non GAAP as adjusted basis.

Loan receivables totaled $57.3 billion at November 30, 2011, which was up from $48.8 billion at November 30, 2010. This was primarily driven by the increase in private student loans due to the acquisition of $3.1 billion of loans from SLC in the first quarter of 2011 (see Note 4: Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements), and an additional $2.4 billion of student loans acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 (see Note 6: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements). Credit card loan receivables were $46.6 billion at November 30, 2011, which was up from $45.2 billion at November 30, 2010. Personal loan receivables were $2.6 billion at November 30, 2011, which was up from $1.9 billion at November 30, 2010. Discover card sales volume was $100.1 billion for the year ended November 30, 2011, an increase of 8% as compared to the same period in 2010. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in spending by both new and existing customers partially due to increased marketing.Net interest margin rose slightly for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This was driven by an increase in yield on our liquidity portfolio and a decrease in interest expense as a percentage of total loans, partially offset by a decline in yield related to loans. The increase in yield on our liquidity portfolio was driven by a shift to higher yielding investment securities. The decrease in interest expense was related to maturities of deposits bearing higher interest rates, partially offset by increased interest expense on securitized borrowings. The yield on loans declined reflecting an increase in lower yielding student loans. For a more detailed discussion on net interest income, see Net Interest Income. At November 30, 2011, our delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due was 2.39% as compared to 4.06% at November 30, 2010, reflective of improvement throughout 2011 in the underlying credit quality of our portfolio. For the year ended November 30, 2011, our net charge off rate on credit cards declined to 4.50%, as compared to 8.08% for the same period in 2010. A reduction in the loan loss reserve rate and a decline in the level of net charge offs led to a decline in the provision for loan losses for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. For a more detailed discussion on provision for loan losses, see Loan Quality Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses. Total other income increased for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to the inclusion of income from the transition service agreement related to the acquisition of SLC in first quarter 2011 (see Note 4: Business Combinations to our condensed consolidated financial statements). Furthermore, discount and interchange revenue and revenue from fee products increased during the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. These increases were partially offset by a decline in loan fee income as well as a modest loss on investments. The increase in discount and interchange revenue was driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by higher Cashback Bonus rewards. Higher levels of revenue from fee products were driven by lower charge offs relating to these products during the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. Gain on investments declined for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 due to the inclusion of a gain of $19.6 million related to the liquidation of the collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC (Golden Key) during 2010. There was not a similar benefit recognized in 2011. Furthermore, other income in 2010 also included a $23 million charge related to the decision we made in 2010 to sell our remaining federal student loans. There was no such charge to other income during 2011. Total other expense increased for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to higher compensation expenses from increased headcount and higher bonuses. Furthermore, there were higher marketing and business development costs related to new account acquisitions. Professional fees also increased due to higher costs related to key technology initiatives, costs relating to the SLC acquisition, as well as an increase in costs related to efforts to recover charged off accounts. Furthermore, other expense also rose due to an increase in fraud related costs, an increase in legal reserves related to pending litigation and higher investments in various growth initiatives. For the year ended November 30, 2010, other expense benefited from a $29 million expense reversal related to the payment to Morgan Stanley under an amendment to the special dividend agreement that occurred in the first quarter of 2010. There was not a similar benefit recognized in 2011. 59Table of ContentsFor the Year Ended November 30, 2010 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2009 Our Direct Banking segment had pretax income of $1.1 billion for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to a reported pretax income of $2.0 billion (which included $1.9 billion in income from the settlement of our antitrust litigation) and a non GAAP as adjusted pretax loss of $436 million for the year ended 2009. Discover card sales volume was up for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009 reflecting higher average spend per customer and a continued increase in merchant acceptance. Loan receivables totaled $48.8 billion at November 30, 2010, which was down from $50.9 billion at November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, reflecting a decline in credit card loans and federal student loans, partially offset by an increase in personal loans and private student loans. Although sales volumes increased, credit card loans declined as a result of a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate. In 2010, we sold $1.5 billion in federal student loans to the U.S. Department of Education and classified the remaining $788 million of federal student loan balances as held for sale. Net interest income declined during 2010 as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, largely due to a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a lower net interest margin. The decline in net interest margin is reflective of the impact of legislative changes on credit card yield and an increase in the average level of lower rate student loan balances, partially offset by higher interest rates earned on standard balances and fewer promotional rate balances. At November 30, 2010, our over 30 days delinquency rate was 3.89% as compared to 5.31% at November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, reflective of continued improvement in credit performance. For the year ended November 30, 2010, our net charge off rate declined to 7.57%, compared to 7.77% for the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. Provision for loan losses for the year ended November 30, 2010 was lower as compared to November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis primarily due to a reduction in the loan loss reserve rate and a decline in the level of net charge offs.Total other income decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis primarily due to the discontinuance of overlimit fees on consumer credit card loans beginning in February 2010 and a decline in late fees beginning in August 2010 in connection with implementing the provisions of the CARD Act. Other income in 2010 also included a $23 million charge related to the decision we made in 2010 to sell our remaining federal student loans. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in discount and interchange revenue and a $19.6 million gain related to the liquidation of collateral supporting our Golden Key investment. Total other expense decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, as the impact of the cost containment initiatives begun in 2009, particularly those related to employee compensation and benefits and information processing and communications, largely offset the impact of higher marketing expenses. Additionally, the first quarter of 2010 benefited from a $29 million expense reversal related to the payment to Morgan Stanley under an amendment to the special dividend agreement, while the second quarter of 2009 included a $20 million restructuring charge related to a reduction in force. Payment ServicesFor the Year Ended November 30, 2011 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2010Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $166 million for the year ended November 30, 2011, up $25 million as compared to the same period during 2010 as a result of higher volumes and margins from transactions on the PULSE network. Expenses increased due to higher employee compensation due to higher headcount and investments related to enhancing our processing capacity. Transaction dollar volume increased $25 billion for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010, primarily driven by increased PULSE volume. The number of transactions on the PULSE network increased by 16% for the year ended November 30, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010.For the Year Ended November 30, 2010 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2009 Our Payment Services segment reported pretax income of $141 million for the year ended November 30, 2010, up $35 million as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009. Revenues were up $28 million as a result of increased volumes from new and existing clients, as well as higher margins from transactions on the PULSE network. Expenses were down $8 million primarily due to transaction processing cost reduction initiatives as well as a lower level of international marketing investments.Transaction dollar volume for the year ended November 30, 2010 was $152 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the year ended November 30, 2009. The increase in transaction dollar volume was driven by higher volumes from all three contributors of our payments business, particularly PULSE volume. The number of transactions on the PULSE network 60Table of Contentsincreased by 15% for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009. Critical Accounting EstimatesIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to our allowance for loan losses, the accrual of credit card customer rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, estimates of future cash flows associated with purchased credit impaired loans and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates. Allowance for Loan Losses We base our allowance for loan loss on several analyses that help us estimate incurred losses as of the balance sheet date. While our estimation process includes historical data and analysis, there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced to determine the allowance. We use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. Management also estimates loss emergence by using other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts. The considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, and forecasting uncertainties. Given the same information, others may reach different reasonable estimates. If management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net loan losses, the impact to the allowance for loan losses could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 10% change in managements estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $221 million in the allowance for loan losses at November 30, 2011, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan losses. See Loan Quality and Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about our allowance for loan losses. Customer Rewards Cost We offer our customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we offer certain customers a reward equal to a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customers purchases. The liability for customer rewards is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition. We compute our rewards liability on an individual customer basis and it is accumulated as qualified customers make progress toward earning a reward through their ongoing purchase activity. The liability is adjusted for expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards. In determining the forfeiture estimate, we consider historical rewards redemption and forfeiture behavior, the level of recent customer purchase activity and the terms of the current rewards programs. We generally recognize reward costs as a reduction of discount and interchange revenue in the consolidated statements of income. If management used a different estimate of forfeitures, our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed. For example, a 100 basis point decrease in the estimated forfeiture rate as of November 30, 2011, could have resulted in an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $12 million. The corresponding increase in rewards cost would have been reflected as a decrease in discount and interchange revenue. See Other Income and Note 3: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for further details about credit card rewards cost. Goodwill and Other Nonamortizable Intangible Assets We recognize goodwill when the purchase price of an acquired business exceeds the total of the fair values of the acquired net assets. In addition, we have recognized certain other nonamortizable intangible assets in our acquisition of the Diners Club business. As required by GAAP, we test goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment annually, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, management must estimate the fair value of the business unit(s) to which the goodwill relates. Because market data concerning acquisitions of comparable 61Table of Contentsbusinesses typically are not readily obtainable, other valuation techniques such as earnings multiples and cash flow models are used in estimating the fair values of these businesses. Similarly, in evaluating the other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, management estimates their fair values using discounted cash flow models. In applying these techniques, management considers historical results, business forecasts, market and industry conditions and other factors. We may also consult independent valuation experts where needed in applying these valuation techniques. The valuation methodologies we use involve assumptions about business performance, revenue and expense growth, discount rates and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. If economic conditions deteriorate or other events adversely impact the assumptions used by management in these valuations, we may be exposed to an impairment loss that, when recognized, could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. At November 30, 2011, there were no reporting units or intangible assets that were at reasonable risk for failing the respective impairment evaluations. Income Taxes We are subject to the income tax laws of the jurisdictions where we have business operations, primarily the United States, its states and municipalities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and tax reserves are established as appropriate. Changes in the estimate of income taxes can occur due to tax rate changes, interpretations of tax laws, the status and resolution of examinations by the taxing authorities, and newly enacted laws and regulations that impact the relative merits of tax positions taken. When such changes occur, the effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations can be significant. See Note 17: Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes. Purchased Credit Impaired LoansThe estimate of expected future cash flows on purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans determines the amount of yield we can recognize in future periods and impacts whether a loan loss reserve must be established for these loans. We re evaluate the amount and timing of expected cash flows quarterly using updated loan portfolio characteristics as well as assumptions regarding expected borrower default and prepayment behavior. Because estimates of expected future cash flows on PCI loans involve assumptions and significant judgment, it is reasonably possible that others could derive different estimates than ours for the same periods. In addition, changes in estimates from one period to the next can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. A decrease in expected cash flows involving an increase in estimated credit losses would result in an immediate charge to earnings for the recognition of a loan loss provision. Increases or decreases in expected cash flows related solely to changes in estimated prepayments or to changes in variable interest rate indices would result in prospective yield adjustments over the remaining life of the loans. An increase in expected cash flows due to a reduction in expected credit losses would result first in the reversal of any previously established loan loss reserve on PCI loans through an immediate credit to earnings and then, if needed, a prospective adjustment to yield over the remaining life of the loans. If management used a different estimate of expected borrower defaults, our consolidated statement of financial condition and results of operations could have differed. For example, a 10% increase in the expected borrower default rate of each PCI loan pool as of November 30, 2011 could have resulted in an impairment of up to $55 million. This impairment would have been reflected as an increase in provision for loan losses and a decrease in the carrying value of the PCI loans. The accounting and estimates used in our calculations are discussed further in Note 6: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements.62Table of ContentsEarnings SummaryThe following table outlines changes in our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended November 30, 2011 vs. 2010increase (decrease) 2010 vs. 2009increase (decrease) 2011 2010 2009(Non GAAP As Adjusted 1) $ % $ % Interest income$6,345,139 $6,146,218 $6,435,152 $198,921 3 % $(288,934) (4)% Interest expense1,484,552 1,582,988 1,605,499 (98,436) (6)% (22,511) (1)% Net interest income4,860,587 4,563,230 4,829,653 297,357 7 % (266,423) (6)% Provision for loan losses1,013,350 3,206,705 5,123,030 (2,193,355) (68)% (1,916,325) (37)% Net interest income (loss) after provision for loan losses3,847,237 1,356,525 (293,377) 2,490,712 NM 1,649,902 NM Other income2,205,174 2,094,999 2,186,064 110,175 5 % (91,065) (4)% Other expense2,541,167 2,182,665 2,222,096 358,502 16 % (39,431) (2)% Income (loss) before income tax expense3,511,244 1,268,859 (329,409) 2,242,385 NM 1,598,268 NM Income tax expense (benefit)1,284,536 504,071 (92,125) 780,465 NM 596,196 NM Net income (loss)$2,226,708 $764,788 $(237,284) $1,461,920 NM $1,002,072 NM (1) See Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data.63Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeThe tables that follow this section have been provided to supplement the discussion below and provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes on net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. We analyze net interest income in total by calculating net interest margin (interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of average total loan receivables) and net yield on interest bearing assets (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). We also separately consider the impact of the level of loan receivables and the related interest yield and the impact of the cost of funds related to each of our funding sources, along with the income generated by our liquidity investment portfolio, on net interest income.Our interest earning assets consist of: (i) loan receivables, (ii) cash and cash equivalents, which includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve, certain highly rated certificates of deposit, and triple A rated government mutual funds, (iii) restricted cash, (iv) short term investments and (v) investment securities. Our interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both direct to consumer and brokered, and long term borrowings, including amounts owed to securitization investors. Net interest income is influenced by the following:The level and composition of loan receivables, including the proportion of credit card loans to other consumer loans, as well as the proportion of loan receivables bearing interest at promotional rates as compared to standard rates;The credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge offs of finance charges, which reduce interest income;The terms of long term borrowings and certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate;The level and composition of other interest bearing assets and liabilities, including our liquidity investment portfolio;Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationships among interest rate indices, such as the prime rate, the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR;The effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program; andThe difference between the carrying amount and future cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans.For the Year Ended November 30, 2011 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2010 Net interest margin rose slightly for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This was driven by an increase in yield on our liquidity portfolio, as well as a decrease in interest expense as a percentage of total loans, partially offset by a decline in yield related to loans. Interest income on loan receivables increased during the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010, as an increase in interest income from other consumer loans was partially offset by a decline in interest income from credit card loans. The increase in interest income from other consumer loans for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of SLC during the first quarter of 2011, as well as growth in personal loans. For the year ended November 30, 2011, the decline in interest income from credit card loans was mostly driven by a decline in yield caused by an increase in promotional rate balances and a decrease in customers who carry a balance on their cards, partially offset by lower interest charge offs. Furthermore, the decline in yield was also impacted by the CARD Act that was implemented in 2010, which led to restrictions on imposing default interest rates on existing balances. Interest income on other interest earning assets, which largely relates to investment income on our liquidity investment portfolio, increased primarily due to a shift in the mix of our liquidity investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2010 from cash and cash equivalents to investments in securities of the U.S Treasury and U.S. government agencies, which typically have a higher yield than cash and cash equivalents. Interest expense declined in the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. This was primarily due to a decline in interest expense related to maturities of deposits bearing higher interest rates. This was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on securitized borrowings, primarily due to the acquisition of three SLC securitization trusts in the first quarter of 2011 which have higher funding costs than our credit card securitizations.64Table of ContentsFor the Year Ended November 30, 2010 compared to the Year Ended November 30, 2009 Net interest income was $4.6 billion for the year ended November 30, 2010, a decline of 6% as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. The decline in net interest income was primarily due to a lower average level of credit card loan receivables as well as a decline in net interest margin. Net interest margin was 9.14% for the year ended November 30, 2010, down 31 basis points as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. This reflects a greater proportion of lower rate student loans in our loan portfolio for much of the year, lower rates earned on higher balances in our liquidity investment portfolio and higher rates paid on long term borrowings, partially offset by lower deposit funding costs and an improvement in credit card yield. Yield on credit card loan receivables improved as a result of fewer promotional rate balances and higher interest rates earned on standard balances, partially offset by the impact of legislative changes related to restrictions on increasing interest rates on existing balances beginning in February 2010. Although the yield on credit card loan receivables was higher for the full year 2010 as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, the credit card yield during the fourth quarter 2010 was lower than the fourth quarter 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. The level of net interest income also declined during the year ended November 30, 2010, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, because of a decline in the average level of credit card loan receivables, which was driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances and an increase in the payment rate. This was partially offset by an increase in the level of student loans and a higher average level of liquidity. Interest expense declined slightly for the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis largely as a result of lower interest expense on securitized debt and deposits offset by higher expense associated with subordinated debt issuances in late 2009 and April 2010. Interest expense on securitized debt declined because of a significant level of maturities in the first half of 2010. Interest expense on deposits declined as the decline in deposit interest rates more than offset the higher level of deposit borrowings, which replaced the maturing asset backed securities. 65Table of ContentsAverage Balance Sheet Analysis 2011 2010 2009 (Non GAAP As Adjusted 1) AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate Interest AverageBalance Rate InterestAssets Interest earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents$3,920,401 0.24% $9,569 $9,628,759 0.25% $24,319 $8,854,380 0.56% $50,024Restricted cash1,179,733 0.14% 1,672 2,124,343 0.16% 3,419 2,438,438 0.75% 18,195Other short term investments153,013 1.07% 1,639 235,549 1.03% 2,435 662,979 0.59% 3,883Investment securities5,660,114 1.05% 59,365 1,688,453 1.55% 26,222 485,117 5.20% 25,230Loan receivables(2): Credit card(3)(4)45,204,829 12.51% 5,654,088 45,616,791 12.79% 5,836,002 48,844,325 12.63% 6,169,303 Personal loans2,228,226 11.94% 266,081 1,592,661 11.41% 181,653 1,223,841 11.38% 139,247 Federal student loans(5)753,666 1.58% 11,904 1,817,990 1.23% 22,439 626,422 1.39% 8,698Private student loans1,637,260 7.04% 115,307 826,807 5.75% 47,518 363,985 4.73% 17,208PCI student loans3,104,504 7.25% 225,096 % % Other14,137 2.95% 418 54,938 4.02% 2,211 71,544 4.70% 3,364Total loan receivables52,942,622 11.85% 6,272,894 49,909,187 12.20% 6,089,823 51,130,117 12.40% 6,337,820Total interest earning assets63,855,883 9.94% 6,345,139 63,586,291 9.67% 6,146,218 63,571,031 10.12% 6,435,152Allowance for loan losses(2,710,377) (3,870,545) (3,550,229) Other assets3,791,077 3,978,625 3,139,709 Total assets$64,936,583 $63,694,371 63,160,511 Liabilities and Stockholders Equity Interest bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits: Time deposits(6)$25,477,735 3.34% 849,743 $27,274,405 3.82% 1,042,683 24,748,485 4.51% 1,116,816Money market deposits4,656,321 1.23% 57,314 4,303,762 1.36% 58,745 4,091,867 1.59% 64,902Other interest bearing savings deposits5,996,123 1.33% 79,719 2,980,286 1.65% 49,076 283,238 1.89% 5,366Total interest bearing deposits(7)36,130,179 2.73% 986,776 34,558,453 3.33% 1,150,504 29,123,590 4.08% 1,187,084Borrowings: Short term borrowings127,840 0.10% 133 410 0.24% 1 837,452 0.30% 2,538Securitized borrowings15,968,420 2.10% 335,143 17,247,078 1.58% 272,535 22,720,700 1.56% 354,215Other long term borrowings(6)2,467,806 6.58% 162,500 2,736,017 5.85% 159,948 1,648,735 3.74% 61,662Total borrowings18,564,066 2.68% 497,776 19,983,505 2.16% 432,484 25,206,887 1.66% 418,415Total interest bearing liabilities54,694,245 2.71% 1,484,552 54,541,958 2.90% 1,582,988 54,330,477 2.96% 1,605,499Other liabilities and stockholders equity10,242,338 9,152,413 8,830,034 Total liabilities and stockholders equity$64,936,583 $63,694,371 63,160,511 Net interest income $4,860,587 $4,563,230 $4,829,653Net interest margin(8) 9.18% 9.14% 9.45% Net yield on interest bearing assets(9) 7.61% 7.18% 7.60% Interest rate spread(10) 7.23% 6.77% 7.16% (1)Information related to restricted cash, investment securities, credit card loan receivables, allowance for loan losses, other assets, securitized borrowings, other long term borrowings and other liabilities and stockholders equity are presented on a non GAAP as adjusted basis.

(2)Represents purchased credit impaired private student loans which do not have a related allowance for loan losses or charge offs (see Note 6: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements).Provision and Allowance for Loan LossesProvision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include:The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements;Changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors;Changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio;The level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge offs;The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts; andRegulatory changes or new regulatory guidance.In calculating the allowance for loan losses, we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics, such as credit card and other consumer loans. For consumer loans, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. We use other analyses to estimate losses incurred from non delinquent accounts which adds an additional element to the identification of loss emergence. We use these analyses together to determine our allowance for loan losses.68Table of ContentsFor the year ended November 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses decreased $2.2 billion as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010. This decrease was primarily due to improved credit performance, which resulted in a decline in the level of net charge offs, discussed in Net Charge offs below. Improvements in credit performance were also evidenced by a decline in the delinquency rate for the year, which was the primary driver of the reduction in the allowance for loan losses. At November 30, 2011, the allowance for loan losses was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from November 30, 2010. For the year ended November 30, 2010, the provision for loan losses decreased $1.9 billion as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. This decrease was attributable to lower net charge offs and a reduction in the allowance for loan losses. The reduction in the allowance for loan losses was due to improved delinquency statistics, which resulted in lower loan loss reserve rates, as well as a $2.3 billion decline in the level of credit card loans. More specifically, our allowance at November 30, 2010 was $3.3 billion, a decline of $598 million as compared to November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. This full year net reduction in the allowance includes a $305 million increase to the allowance in the first quarter 2010 upon managements consideration of refined analytics that expanded its ability to identify loss emergence. At November 30, 2011, the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans increased by $40 million as compared to November 30, 2010 mainly due to the increase in private student loan receivables as well as the seasoning of the loan portfolio. At November 30, 2010, the level of the allowance related to other consumer loans decreased by $16 million as compared to November 30, 2009. This was largely attributable to a decline in our personal loan reserve rate due to credit improvement in that portfolio. This was partially offset by a reserve increase related to a higher level of private student loans. The following table provides changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended November 30, 2009 2008 2007 2011 2010 (Non GAAPAs Adjusted1) (Non GAAPAs Adjusted1) (Non GAAP As Adjusted1)Balance at beginning of period$3,304,118 $1,757,899 $2,754,357 $1,731,655 $1,632,291Additions: Addition to allowance related to securitized receivables(2) 2,144,461 Provision for loan losses1,013,350 3,206,705 5,123,030 3,476,644 1,896,753Deductions: Charge off related to loans sold (25,342) Charge offs: Discover card(2,594,169) (4,094,236) (4,242,494) (2,832,771) (2,201,741)Discover business card(21,154) (59,986) (62,115) (19,814) (2,418)Total credit card loans(2,615,323) (4,154,222) (4,304,609) (2,852,585) (2,204,159)Personal loans(69,273) (92,351) (68,590) (7,974) (1,857)Federal student loans (719) Private student loans(7,931) (2,783) (468) (8) Other(1,315) (1,018) (22) (83) (25)Total other consumer loans(78,519) (96,871) (69,080) (8,065) (1,882)Total charge offs(2,693,842) (4,251,093) (4,373,689) (2,860,650) (2,206,041)Recoveries: Discover card575,838 466,548 396,483 405,844 407,606Discover business card3,642 3,549 1,233 272 35Total credit card loans579,480 470,097 397,716 406,116 407,641Personal loans1,985 1,307 906 576 988Private student loans101 38 2 Other4 46 38 16 23Total other consumer loans2,090 1,391 946 592 1,011Total recoveries581,570 471,488 398,662 406,708 408,652Net charge offs(2,112,272) (3,779,605) (3,975,027) (2,453,942) (1,797,389)Balance at end of period$2,205,196 $3,304,118 $3,902,360 $2,754,357 $1,731,655 (1)Information related to Discover card and total loans is presented on an adjusted basis.

No adjustments have been made for Discover business card, federal and private student loans, personal loans or other loans. See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data. Net Charge offsOur net charge offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income, respectively, which is effectively a reclassification of the loan loss provision, while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due. Closed end consumer loan receivables are generally charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past due. Generally, customer bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180 day or 120 day contractual time frame. The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge offs of key loan portfolio segments (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2009 2008 2007 2011 2010 (Non GAAP As Adjusted1) (Non GAAP As Adjusted1) (Non GAAP As Adjusted1) $ % $ % $ % $ % $ %Credit card loans$2,035,843 4.50% $3,684,125 8.08% $3,906,893 8.00% $2,446,469 5.07% $1,796,518 3.84%Personal loans$67,288 3.02% $91,044 5.72% $67,684 5.53% $7,398 1.19% $869 3.43%Private student loans (excluding PCI(2))$7,830 0.48% $2,745 0.33% $466 0.05% $8 0.01% $ % (1)Information related to credit card loan receivables for years prior to 2010 is presented on a non GAAP as adjusted basis.

(2)Charge offs for PCI loans did not result in a charge to earnings during 2011 and are therefore excluded from the calculation. See Note 6: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the accounting for charge offs on PCI loans.The net charge off rate on our credit card loan receivables decreased 358 basis points for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010. The decrease in net charge offs was attributable to improvement in both contractual and bankruptcy related charge offs subsequent to a peak in the level of charge offs in the first quarter of 2010. Furthermore, during the year ended November 30, 2011 there were higher levels of recoveries as compared to the same periods in 2010. As relatively few newly originated student loans had entered repayment in 2011, the net charge off rate on student loans remained low in 2011 similar to the prior year. The amount of charge offs on credit card loans decreased for the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. The level of contractual and bankruptcy charge offs had peaked by the end of the first quarter of 2010 and then declined throughout 2010 as a result of improvement in the economic environment. However, the net charge off rate on our credit card loans increased slightly for the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis due to a lower average level of credit card loans. The seasoning of our personal loan portfolio led to higher charge off amounts during the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to 2009. Similar to 2011, there were low levels of student loans in repayment in 2010 and thus minimal levels of net charge offs.70Table of ContentsDelinquenciesDelinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at a point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. Information related to loans 90 days or more delinquent and accruing interest is provided in Note 6: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements.

No adjustments have been made for personal loan or private student loan receivables. See reconciliation in Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data. (3)Restructured loans include $37.9 million, $35.0 million and $9.7 million for the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, that are also included in loans over 90 days delinquent or more.(4)Data not available for the years ended November 30, 2008 and 2007.Both credit card and personal loan receivables delinquency rates at November 30, 2011 have generally declined as compared to November 30, 2010 due to continued improvement in customer financial performance, which has resulted in improvements in both over 30 day and over 90 day delinquency balances. The decline is also attributable to proactive customer account management. The rate for over 30 day delinquency balances increased for private student loan balances due to the seasoning of our loan portfolio for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. The rate for over 90 day delinquency balances for private student loan balances was flat for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to 2010. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2011 decreased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of bankruptcies. Restructured credit card loans at November 30, 2011 increased to $1.2 billion from $305.3 million at November 30, 2010 because we began accounting for credit card loans modified through temporary hardship and external programs as troubled debt restructurings during 2011.71Table of ContentsThe delinquency rates of credit card loans over 30 day and over 90 day delinquent have both decreased at November 30, 2010 as compared to November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. The delinquency rates on personal loans also experienced improvement in 2010 as compared to 2009. Similar to 2011, the decline in delinquency rates for both credit card and personal loans is due to improvements in customer financial performance and proactive customer account management. Loan receivables not accruing interest at November 30, 2010 decreased as compared to November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, as a result of a decrease in bankruptcy notifications. Restructured loans at November 30, 2010 increased as compared to November 30, 2009 due to the volume that entered a permanent program as a result of an increased focus on collection in 2010.Maturities and Sensitivities of Loan Receivables to Changes in Interest Rates Our loan portfolio had the following maturity distribution(1) at November 30, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Due OneYear orLess Due AfterOne YearThroughFive Years Due AfterFive Years TotalCredit card loans$14,892,116 $24,928,752 $6,817,757 $46,638,625Personal loans27,703 1,939,777 680,571 2,648,051Private student loans (excluding PCI)306,492 220,587 1,541,922 2,069,001PCI private student loans14,068 311,456 4,924,864 5,250,388Other consumer loans273 12 16,405 16,690Total loan portfolio$15,240,652 $27,400,584 $13,981,519 $56,622,755 (1)Because of the uncertainty regarding loan repayment patterns, the above amounts have been calculated using contractually required minimum payments. Historically, actual loan repayments have been higher than such minimum payments and, therefore, the above amounts may not necessarily be indicative of our actual loan repayments. At November 30, 2011, approximately $28.0 billion of our loan portfolio due after one year had interest rates tied to an index and approximately $13.4 billion were fixed rate loans. Modified and Restructured LoansWe have loan modification programs that provide for temporary or permanent hardship relief for our credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. The temporary hardship program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction, both lasting for a period no longer than twelve months. The permanent workout program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The permanent programs do not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. We also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. These loans continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. For additional information regarding the accounting treatment for these loans as well as amounts recorded in the financial statements related to these loans, see Note 6: Loan Receivables to our consolidated financial statements.For student loan borrowers, in certain situations we offer payment forbearance to borrowers who are experiencing temporary financial difficulties and are willing to resume making payments. When a delinquent borrower is granted a second forbearance period, we classify these loans as troubled debt restructurings. Approximately $5.4 million of loans in our student loan portfolio are considered troubled debt restructurings. Borrower performance after using forbearance is monitored and the method has proven effective in helping to prevent defaults and in assisting customers experiencing temporary financial difficulties. We plan to continue to use forbearance, and as a result, we expect to have additional loans classified as troubled debt restructurings in the future. For personal loan customers, in certain situations we offer various payment programs, including temporary and permanent programs. The temporary programs normally consist of a reduction of the minimum payment for a period of no longer than twelve months with a final balloon payment required at the end of the loan term. The permanent program involves changing the terms of the loan in order to payoff the outstanding balance over the new term for a period no longer than four years. The total term may not exceed nine years. We also allow loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, similar to our credit card customers discussed above. Payments are modified based on the new terms agreed upon with the credit counseling agency. Personal loans included in permanent programs are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings.72Table of ContentsOther IncomeThe following table presents the components of other income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2011 vs. 2010increase(decrease) 2010 vs. 2009increase(decrease) 2009 2011 2010 (Non GAAP As Adjusted1) $ % $ %Discount and interchange revenue(2)$1,083,847 $1,055,359 $984,088 $28,488 3 % $71,271 7 %Fee products428,193 412,497 403,246 15,696 4 % 9,251 2 %Loan fee income338,147 339,797 494,305 (1,650) % (154,508) (31)%Transaction processing revenue179,989 149,946 125,201 30,043 20 % 24,745 20 %Merchant fees16,184 28,461 44,248 (12,277) (43)% (15,787) (36)%(Loss) gain on investments(3,622) 19,131 (3,826) (22,753) (119)% 22,957 NMOther income162,436 89,808 138,802 72,628 81 % (48,994) (35)%Total other income$2,205,174 $2,094,999 $2,186,064 $110,175 5 % $(91,065) (4)% (1)See Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data. (2)Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $879 million, $738 million and $670 million for the years ended November 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively.Total other income increased for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010 due to increases in discount and interchange revenue, fee product revenue, transaction processing revenue and other income, partially offset by lower merchant fees and a decrease in gain on investments. These key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below. Total other income decreased in the year ended November 30, 2010 compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis as lower loan fees and other income were partially offset by higher revenues from discount and interchange, transaction processing revenue and a $19.6 million gain relating to the liquidation of collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key. These key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below. Discount and Interchange Revenue Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third party issuers. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. We earn acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions and certain Diners Club transactions made by credit card customers at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing credit card purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network and on certain transactions on the Diners Club network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organizations transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our customers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain customers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the customers purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. Sales volume increased during the years ended November 30, 2011 and 2010, driving an increase in discount and interchange revenue that was partially offset by a higher level of rewards. In total, our gross discount and interchange revenue increased by $170 million for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010, which was partially offset by a $141 million increase in Cashback Bonus rewards earned by our customers. For the year ended November 30, 2010 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, our gross discount and interchange revenue increased by $140 million, which was partially offset by a $68 million increase in Cashback Bonus rewards earned by our customers. 73Table of ContentsFee Products We earn revenue related to fees received for selling ancillary products and services, including payment protection and identity theft protection services, to customers. The amount of revenue recorded is generally based on either a percentage of a customers outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized as earned. Fee products income increased for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended 2010 primarily due to lower chargeoffs related to these products.Fee products income increased slightly for the year ended November 30, 2010, as compared to the year ended November 30, 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis primarily due to an increase in revenue from our identity theft protection product. Loan Fee Income Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, cash advance, pay by phone and other miscellaneous fees. However, as a result of legislative changes that became effective in 2010, we no longer charge overlimit or pay by phone fees on consumer credit card loans and additional legislative changes also resulted in modifications to our late fee policy beginning August 2010. Loan fee income was flat for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010. Although late fees decreased in 2011 due to the modifications discussed above, this was offset by higher overlimit fees in 2011 as there was a heightened amount of overlimit fee charge offs in 2010. Although there was no material income relating to overlimit fees during 2011, there was a significant amount of overlimit fees that were delinquent in February 2010 and were subsequently charged off. In 2010, loan fee income decreased substantially as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, primarily due to the legislative changes mentioned above. We had a minimal level of overlimit fees in 2010 as compared to $82 million in 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis, which was the last year in which we charged overlimit fees throughout the entire year (overlimit fees were $44 million in 2009 on a GAAP basis). Additionally, our late fee income declined by $45 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. This was due in part to the legislative changes mentioned above, but also due to a higher level of late payment incidences in 2009 as a result of the credit environment at that time. Merchant Fees To broaden merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards, we began outsourcing our acquisition and servicing of small and mid sized merchants to merchant acquiring organizations in late 2006. We have also sold small and mid size merchant portfolios to third party acquirers to facilitate integrated servicing and to reduce costs. As we have moved away from direct merchant relationships, our merchant fee income and related costs have declined to $16 million in 2011 as compared to $28 million in 2010 and $44 million in 2009. The lower income per transaction is generally offset by increased volume due to broader acceptance. Transaction Processing Revenue Transaction processing revenue represents switch fees charged to financial institutions and merchants for processing ATM, debit and point of sale transactions over the PULSE network, as well as various participation and membership fees. Switch fees are charged on a per transaction basis. Transaction processing revenue increased for 2011 as compared to 2010, as well as for 2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to continued higher transaction volumes at PULSE partially offset by increased business development costs. Gain (Loss) on InvestmentsGain (loss) on investment securities includes realized gains and losses on the sale of investments as well as any write downs of investment securities to fair value when the decline in fair value is considered other than temporary. Gain (loss) on investment securities in 2010 included a gain of $19.6 million which related to the liquidation of collateral supporting the asset backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key. There was not a similar benefit recognized in 2011 or 2009. Other Income Other income includes royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, revenue from the transition service agreements related to the acquisition of SLC, revenue from merchants related to reward programs, revenues from third party issuers and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income increased for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to November 30, 2010 due to the acquisition of SLC in the first quarter of 2011 which resulted in the inclusion of transition service agreement revenue totaling $27 million as well as a bargain purchase gain of $7 million. For the year ended November 30, 2011 other income included a $5 million gain relating to fair value adjustments on our loans held for sale as compared to a $23 million loss related to the initial write down of those same loans during the year ended November 30, 2010. 74Table of ContentsOther income decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009. In 2010 revenue from the referral of declined applications to third party issuers was lower as compared to the prior years due to a lower level of acquisition activity. In addition, other income included the $23 million loss as further described above.Other ExpenseThe following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): For the Years Ended November 30, 2011 vs. 2010increase(decrease) 2010 vs. 2009increase(decrease) 2009 2011 2010 (Non GAAP As Adjusted1) $ % $ %Employee compensation and benefits$914,344 $802,649 $827,683 $111,695 14% $(25,034) (3)%Marketing and business development537,486 463,086 406,020 74,400 16% 57,066 14 %Information processing and communications263,741 258,111 289,209 5,630 2% (31,098) (11)%Professional fees415,275 342,648 321,329 72,627 21% 21,319 7 %Premises and equipment71,128 70,274 73,014 854 1% (2,740) (4)%Other expense339,193 245,897 304,841 93,296 38% (58,944) (19)%Total other expense$2,541,167 $2,182,665 $2,222,096 $358,502 16% $(39,431) (2)% (1)See Reconciliations of GAAP to Non GAAP As Adjusted Data. Total other expense increased $358 million in 2011 as compared to 2010. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of SLC, growth and infrastructure investments made to expand the loan portfolio, network acceptance and deposits, and the associated impacts on headcount and compensation. Increased marketing and business development costs were primarily driven by higher investments in new credit card account acquisitions and new originations in student and personal loans enabled by the strong credit performance experienced in 2011. Professional fees increased due to higher costs related to key technology and growth initiatives, along with costs related to the SLC acquisition and higher costs related to recovering charged off accounts. Other expense increased compared to prior year due to higher fraud related costs and an increase in legal reserves related to pending litigation. In addition, 2010 other expense included a $29 million non recurring benefit related to the reversal of expense that had been recorded related to the payment to Morgan Stanley under an amendment to the special dividend agreement. There was not a similar benefit in 2011.Total other expense decreased $39 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 on a non GAAP as adjusted basis. Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased as we reduced our cost base under uncertain economic conditions in 2009 and into 2010. Information processing and communications expense was lower in 2010 than in 2009 due to our efforts to reduce costs associated with ongoing contracts. Other expense was lower in 2010 due to (i) a $29 million nonrecurring benefit discussed above; (ii) a $20 million restructuring charge recorded during the second quarter 2009 as a result of the reduction in headcount and (iii) a $14 million decline in costs relating to fraud. These declines in expenses were partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses, due to increased advertising and promotional marketing expenses and higher investments in account acquisition, and an increase in professional fees, due to higher collection fees and advisory expenses related to the acquisition of SLC. 75Table of ContentsIncome Tax ExpenseThe following table reconciles the Companys effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate: For the Year Ended November 30, 2011 2010 2009U.S. federal statutory income tax rate35.0 % 35.0% 35.0 %U.S. state and local income taxes and other income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits2.4 4.1 4.1Valuation allowance capital loss(0.6) 1.1Other(0.2) 0.6 (0.4)Effective income tax rate36.6 % 39.7% 39.8 %Income tax expense increased $780.5 million, or 155%, for the year ended November 30, 2011 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2010, which resulted from an increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate decreased 3.1% for the year ended November 30, 2011 from 39.7% for the year ended November 30, 2010. In 2011, we received confirmation of a states treatment on a previously uncertain tax position and the settlement of certain state examination issues which resulted in the release of related reserves. We also released the valuation allowance previously recognized in May 2009 on a tax benefit arising from the capital loss associated with sale of the Goldfish business unit. These reserve releases contributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate.For 2010, we had tax expense of $504 million as compared to a tax benefit of $92 million for 2009. The increase was the result of shifting from a non GAAP as adjusted pretax loss position in 2009 to a pretax income position in 2010. 2010 also included $49.9 million of state tax expense which was attributable to an increase in pretax income and tax liabilities in additional states. 76Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesFunding and LiquidityWe seek to maintain diversified funding sources and a strong liquidity profile in order to fund our business and repay or refinance our maturing obligations. In addition, we seek to achieve an appropriate maturity profile and utilize a cost effective mix of funding sources. Our primary funding sources include deposits, sourced directly from consumers or through brokers, term asset backed securitizations, private asset backed securitizations and long term borrowings.Funding SourcesDeposits. We offer deposit products, including certificates of deposit, money market accounts, online savings accounts and Individual Retirement Account (IRA) certificates of deposit, to customers through two channels: (i) through direct marketing, internet origination and affinity relationships (direct to consumer deposits); and (ii) indirectly through contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms (brokered deposits).At November 30, 2011, we had $26.2 billion of direct to consumer deposits and $13.3 billion of brokered deposits. Maturities of our certificates of deposit range from one month to ten years, with a weighted average maturity of 20 months at November 30, 2011. The following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity as of November 30, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Total Three Monthsor Less Over ThreeMonthsThrough SixMonths Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths Over TwelveMonthsCertificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000(1)$20,114,121 $2,185,259 $2,805,104 $4,079,327 $11,044,431Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 to less than $250,000(1)5,290,405 736,464 601,541 1,360,325 2,592,075Certificates of deposit in amounts of $250,000(1)or greater1,189,779 226,874 134,194 290,787 537,924Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts12,869,582 12,869,582 Total interest bearing deposits$39,463,887 $16,018,179 $3,540,839 $5,730,439 $14,174,430 (1)$100,000 represents the basic insurance amount previously covered by the FDIC. Effective July 21, 2010, the basic insurance per depositor was permanently increased to $250,000.Credit Card Securitization Financing. We use the securitization of credit card receivables as an additional source of funding. We access the asset backed securitization market using the Discover Card Master Trust I (DCMT) and the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DCENT), through which we issue asset backed securities both publicly and through private transactions.The DCMT structure utilizes Class A and Class B certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates, cash collateral accounts and subordinated Series 2009 CE. The DCENT structure utilizes four classes of securities with declining levels of seniority (Class A, B, C and D), with credit enhancement provided by the more subordinated classes of notes. We retain significant exposure to the performance of trust assets through holdings of the sellers interest and subordinated security classes of DCMT and DCENT.The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as economic early amortization, which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged off receivables. Our excess spread previously included the amount of certain principal collections available to be reallocated from Series 2009 SD, which enhanced securities of both DCMT and DCENT. Series 2009 SD matured on January 17, 2012, and as prescribed in amendments to the governing documents which became effective in January 2010, the size of the Class D (2009 1) note was increased. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread fell below 0% on a three month rolling average basis, we would be required to repay the affected outstanding securitized borrowings using available collections received by the trust (the period of ultimate repayment would be determined by the amount and timing of collections received). An early amortization event would negatively impact our liquidity, and require us to utilize our available non securitization related contingent liquidity or rely on alternative funding sources, which may or may not be available at the time. As of November 30, 2011, the 3 month rolling 77Table of Contentsaverage excess spread was 17.43%, however, the maturity of Series 2009 SD on January 17, 2012 will have the effect of somewhat reducing the trusts excess spread in periods thereafter.Another feature of our securitization structure, which is applicable only to the notes issued from DCENT, is a reserve account funding requirement in which, in limited circumstances, excess cash flows generated by the transferred loan receivables are held at the trust. This funding requirement is triggered when DCENTs three month average excess spread rate decreases to below 4.50%, with increasing funding requirements as excess spread levels decline below preset levels to 0%. See Note 7: Credit Card and Student Loan Securitization Activities to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the structures of DCMT and DCENT and for tables providing information concerning investors interests and related excess spreads at November 30, 2011.At November 30, 2011, we had $13.0 billion of outstanding public asset backed securities, $0.3 billion of outstanding private asset backed securitizations and $5.2 billion of outstanding asset backed securities that had been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries. The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors interests in credit card securitizations excluding those that have been issued to our wholly owned subsidiaries at November 30, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years After FiveYearsScheduled maturities of long term borrowingsowed to credit card securitization investors$13,293,481 $3,325,989 $7,967,989 $999,639 $999,864At November 30, 2011, we had capacity to issue up to $7.8 billion in triple A rated asset backed securities from DCENT without the issuance of additional Class B or Class C notes as subordination. The triple A rating of DCENT Class A Notes issued to date has been based, in part, on an FDIC rule which created a safe harbor that provides that the FDIC, as conservator or receiver, will not, using its power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts, seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer satisfies the conditions for sale accounting treatment under previous GAAP. Pursuant to amendments to GAAP related to transfers of financial assets, effective for us on December 1, 2009, certain transfers of assets to special purpose entities (including Discover Banks transfers of assets to the DCMT) no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment. However, on September 27, 2010, the FDIC approved a final rule that preserves the safe harbor treatment applicable to revolving trusts and master trusts, including the DCMT, so long as those trusts would have satisfied the original FDIC safe harbor if evaluated under GAAP pertaining to transfers of financial assets in effect prior to December 1, 2009. Other legislative and regulatory developments, namely the proposed SEC Regulation AB II (including the SECs July 2011 reproposal of certain of its provisions), the August 2011 SEC advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the rule exempting securitization entities from being regarded as "investment companies" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the securitization and rating agency provisions of the Reform Act and the rules promulgated or proposed thereunder, including proposed rules requiring us to retain risk in our securitization on an unhedged basis, may, however, impact our ability and or desire to issue asset backed securities in the future. Short Term Borrowings. We primarily access short term borrowings through the Federal Funds market or through repurchase agreements. In the past two years, we have rarely used short term borrowings; however, we have recently been borrowing overnight Federal Funds on an opportunistic basis. Total short term borrowings as of November 30, 2011 were $50.0 million and the weighted average interest rate was 0.08%. Information about our use of short term borrowings for the year ended November 30, 2011 is shown in the table below (dollars in thousands): November 30, 2011 Maximum Daily Balance During the PeriodOvernight Federal Funds purchased$265,000Overnight repurchase agreements50,414Corporate and Bank Debt. At November 30, 2011, we had $800 million in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding and Discover Bank had $1.2 billion in principal amount of subordinated notes outstanding. Our senior unsecured notes are comprised of two issuances, each $400 million in principal amount, with one issuance maturing in June 2017 and the other issuance maturing in July 2019. The senior unsecured notes would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a change of control involving us and a corresponding ratings downgrade to below investment grade. Discover Banks subordinated notes are comprised of one $700 million issuance due in November 2019 and a $500 million issuance due in April 2020. For more information, see Note 11: Borrowings to our consolidated financial statements.78Table of ContentsOther Long Term BorrowingsStudent Loans. At November 30, 2011, we had $438 million of funding related to federal student loans, which are currently held for sale, and $2.6 billion of funding related to private student loans. We obtained $500 million of funding in April 2010, of which $438 million is still outstanding as of November 30, 2011, through an agreement with an asset backed commercial paper conduit sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education under the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008. However, upon sale of the related federal student loans, this loan facility will be repaid or assumed by the buyer. We assumed $3.2 billion principal amount outstanding of securitization debt in December 2010 as part of the SLC acquisition, of which $2.8 billion remained outstanding as of November 30, 2011. Principal and interest payments on the underlying student loans will reduce the balance of these secured borrowings over time. Additional Funding SourcesPrivate Asset Backed Securitizations. We have access to committed undrawn capacity through privately placed asset backed securitizations to support the funding of our credit card loan receivables. Under these arrangements, we had used $250 million of capacity and had undrawn capacity of $6.8 billion at November 30, 2011.Federal Reserve. Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphias discount window. As of November 30, 2011, Discover Bank had $8.7 billion of available capacity through the discount window based on the amount of assets pledged. We have no borrowings outstanding under the discount window.Credit RatingsOur borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of Discover Financial Services, Discover Bank and the securitization trusts. Downgrades in these credit ratings could result in higher interest expense on our unsecured debt and asset securitizations. In addition to increased funding costs, deterioration in credit ratings could reduce our borrowing capacity in the unsecured debt and asset securitization capital markets.We also have agreements with certain of our derivative counterparties that contain provisions that require Discover Banks debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from specified major credit rating agencies. If Discover Banks credit rating is reduced to below investment grade, we would be required to post additional collateral, which, as of November 30, 2011, would have been $66 million.A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The credit ratings are summarized in the following table: DiscoverFinancialServices DiscoverBank Outlookfor SeniorUnsecuredDebt DiscoverBank Discover CardMaster Trust I Discover Card ExecutionNote Trust SeniorUnsecuredDebt SeniorUnsecuredDebt SubordinatedDebt Class A(1) Class B Class A(1) Class B Class C Moodys Investors ServiceBa1 Baa3 Stable Ba1 Aaa A1(sf) Aaa(sf) A1(sf) N/A(2)Standard & PoorsBBB BBB Stable BBB AAA(sf) AA+(sf) AAA(sf) AA+(sf) N/A(2)Fitch RatingsBBB BBB Stable BBB AAAsf AAsf AAAsf AA sf N/A(2) (1)A sf in the rating denotes an identification for structured finance product ratings that was implemented for these products by the rating agencies as of September 2010.(2)All Class C notes are currently held by subsidiaries of Discover Bank and therefore, are not publicly rated. Several rating agencies have announced that they will be evaluating the effects of the Reform Act in order to determine the extent, if any, to which financial institutions, including us, may be negatively impacted. While we are currently unaware of any negative actions, there is no assurance that our credit ratings could not be downgraded in the future as a result of any such reviews. See Regulatory Environment and Developments for information regarding the Reform Act.79Table of ContentsLiquidity ManagementWe seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth and satisfy debt obligations under normal and stress conditions. In addition to the funding sources discussed above, we also maintain highly liquid unencumbered assets in our investment portfolio. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. Regular liquidity stress testing and contingency funding planning is performed as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs. These scenarios measure the liquidity position over a two year horizon by analyzing the stress on liquidity versus ability to generate contingent liquidity. We maintain contingent funding sources, including our liquidity portfolio, private securitizations with unused capacity and Federal Reserve discount window capacity, which we could utilize to satisfy liquidity needs during such stress events. We expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during the next 12 months by utilizing our deposit channels, credit card asset backed securitizations and our contingent funding sources.We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Committee (the ALCO). We seek to balance the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity, which may limit financial flexibility and be costly, with having too little liquidity that could cause financial distress. Liquidity risk is centrally managed by the ALCO, which is chaired by our Treasurer and has cross functional membership. The ALCO monitors positions and determines any actions that need to be taken.At November 30, 2011, our liquidity portfolio was comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high quality, liquid investment securities. Cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in deposits with the Federal Reserve. Investment securities included credit card asset backed securities of other issuers and U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency and AAA rated corporate debt obligations issued under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program that are guaranteed by the FDIC, all of which are considered highly liquid. In addition, we have the ability to raise cash by utilizing repurchase agreements and pledging certain of these investments. The level of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.At November 30, 2011, our liquidity portfolio and undrawn credit facilities were $26.2 billion, which was $3.5 billion higher than the balance at November 30, 2010 due to the addition of multi year conduit capacity during 2011 in order to balance the flexibility and economics of our liquidity mix, partially offset by maturities of securitized debt.

The facility was terminated due to the availability 80Table of Contentsof other sources of contingent liquidity. The terms of the credit facility included various affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants related to the maintenance of certain capitalization and tangible net worth levels, and certain double leverage, delinquency and tier 1 capital to loans ratios. The credit facility also included customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross defaults to other agreements evidencing indebtedness for borrowed money and bankruptcy related defaults. For information regarding regulatory initiatives related to liquidity management, see " Regulatory Environment and Developments Capital and Liquidity."CapitalOur primary sources of capital are from the earnings generated by our businesses and issuances in the capital markets. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency guidelines and support future business growth. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that provides attractive returns to our stockholders. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives, and legislative and regulatory developments. Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies, we, along with Discover Bank, must maintain minimum levels of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a direct material effect on our financial position and results. We must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. We maintain a substantial deferred tax asset on our balance sheet, and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels. However, for regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income are currently limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets we expect to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date, based on our projected future taxable income for that year; or (ii) 10% of the amount of our Tier 1 capital. At November 30, 2011, no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes.At November 30, 2011, Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank met the requirements for "well capitalized" status, exceeding the regulatory minimums to which they were subject under Basel I. Current or future regulatory initiatives may require us to hold more capital in the future. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules to implement heightened prudential standards for large bank holding companies, including us, as required by the Reform Act, including risk based capital and leverage standards. In November 2011, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule requiring the submission of annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve for its review and non objection. The instructions accompanying the Federal Reserves final rule regarding capital plans also indicate that the Federal Reserve expects covered companies to show that they can achieve readily and without difficulty the ratios required by the Basel III framework as they would come into effect in the United States. For more information regarding these regulatory initiatives, see Regulatory Environment and Developments Capital and Liquidity. In the second quarter of 2011, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $.02 per share to $.06 per share and maintained a $.06 per share dividend in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2011. In the first quarter of 2012, we increased our dividend to $.10 per share. In addition, on June 15, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock. The program expires on June 14, 2013, and may be terminated at any time. Through the end of fiscal year 2011, we had repurchased 18 million shares, or approximately 3%, of our outstanding common stock for $425 million. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors. The amount and size of any future dividends and share repurchases will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases. For example, our ability to make capital distributions, including our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock, is subject to the Federal Reserves review and non objection of our annual capital plan. In certain circumstances, we will not be able to make a capital distribution unless the Federal Reserve has approved such distribution. Further, as noted above, current or future regulatory initiatives may require us to hold more capital in the future. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends or repurchase any shares of our common stock in the future.

Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an agreement. Our guarantees relate to transactions processed on the Discover Network and certain transactions processed by PULSE and Diners Club. See Note 20: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at November 30, 2011 included deposits, long term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations and purchase obligations. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2011 are summarized below (dollars in thousands): Payments Due By Period Total Less ThanOne Year One YearThroughThree Years Four YearsThroughFive Years More ThanFive YearsDeposits(1)$39,577,462 $25,403,032 $9,821,647 $3,547,568 $805,215 Borrowings(2)18,335,191 3,375,989 8,405,602 999,639 5,553,961Capital lease obligations1,987 427 914 646 Operating leases57,559 10,025 17,901 14,417 15,216Interest payments on fixed rate debt1,643,977 258,175 456,319 431,600 497,883 Purchase obligations(3)545,179 301,173 175,982 55,584 12,440 Other liabilities(4)6,702,723 396,864 409,434 5,794,656 101,769Total contractual obligations$66,864,078 $29,745,685 $19,287,799 $10,844,110 $6,986,484 (1)Deposits do not include interest charges. (2)See Note 11: Borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate notes is estimated to be $429 million as of November 30, 2011, utilizing the current interest rates as of that date. (3)Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license, telecommunications agreements and global acceptance contracts. Purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. Purchase obligations at November 30, 2011 reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition. (4)Other liabilities include our expected future contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans, Discover Banks agreement with Citi to purchase private student loans and the contingent liability associated with our equity method securities.As of November 30, 2011 our consolidated statement of financial condition reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $507 million, and approximately $78.9 million of accrued interest and penalties. Since the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated income tax obligations about which there is uncertainty, as addressed in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, (guidance formerly provided by FASB Interpretation No. 48), have been excluded from the contractual obligations table. See Note 17: Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our tax obligations. We extend credit for consumer and commercial loans, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards and certain other consumer loan products, such as student loans, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. At November 30, 2011, our unused commitments were $163 billion. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by any such guarantees are included in our consolidated financial statements.Prior to its acquisition by Discover Bank on December 31, 2010, SLC had an agreement with Citi providing for the origination and servicing of private student loans. Citi would originate and fund such loans and, after final disbursement, SLC would purchase the loans from Citi. This agreement between SLC and Citi was terminated on December 31, 2010, at which time Discover Bank entered into an agreement with Citi to purchase (i) eligible private student loans originated by Citi prior to December 31, 2010 and (ii) any private student loans originated by Citi on or after December 31, 2010 under a new loan origination agreement entered into between Citi and SLC on December 31, 2010. Discover Bank has agreed to purchase the loans at the funded amount (plus accrued interest and less any capitalized fees for any loans first funded prior to December 31, 2010) and, for any loans first funded by Citi on December 31, 2010 or later, pay a premium equal to 0.125%. Discover Bank 82Table of Contentscompleted the first purchase of loan participations under this agreement on January 3, 2011. The agreement has been amended to extend to December 31, 2012, and was effective upon the closing of Discover Banks purchase of private student loans from Citi on September 30, 2011. Although the agreement does not set forth a minimum or maximum amount of loans to be purchased, Discover Bank must purchase all eligible loans originated by Citi, which the Company estimates to be $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion over the life of the agreement, as amended. As of November 30, 2011, Discover Bank had an outstanding commitment to purchase $170 million of loans under this agreement.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.Interest Rate Risk. We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers, as well as invest in other assets and our business. These loans and other assets earn interest, which we use to pay interest on the money borrowed. Our net interest income and, therefore, earnings, will be negatively affected if the interest rate earned on assets increases at a slower pace than increases to the interest rate we owe on our borrowings. Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to those changes may influence customer payment rates, loan balances or deposit account activity. We may face higher cost alternative sources of funding as a result, which has the potential to decrease earnings.Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the mix of variable and fixed rate assets. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or liability from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate. See Note 23: Derivatives and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements for information on our derivatives activity.We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12 month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree.Our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio. Due to recently enacted credit card legislation, we now have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances. At November 30, 2011, the majority of our credit card and student loans were at variable rates. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses.Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12 month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12 month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12 month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2011, we estimate that net interest income over the following 12 month period would increase by approximately $49 million, or 1%. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at November 30, 2010, we estimated that net interest income over the following 12 month period would increase by approximately $50 million, or 1%. We have not provided an estimate of any impact on net interest income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels (i.e., Prime and LIBOR) and, therefore, could not materially decrease further.83Table of Contents
