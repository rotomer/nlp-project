ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES General A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2002 and 2001, and for the years ended September 30, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for public companies operating in the United States of America. In instances where alternative methods of accounting for a given economic phenomenon are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected. Basis of presentation Our financial statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its majority owned or controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Except for insignificant amounts remaining from our venture capital investments of fiscal 1999 and 2000, and a few inconsequential joint ventures we inherited with the Schuler acquisition, we owned no minority interests in unconsolidated entities at September 30, 2002. Based upon currently available information, we believe that none of them will qualify for consolidation in our financial statements under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) proposed new accounting rules on consolidations. Segment information Our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in 20 states and 44 markets throughout the United States. The financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets. We have no foreign subsidiaries or operations. Revenue recognition We recognize homebuilding revenues when homes close and title to and possession of the property is formally transferred to the buyer. Virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing. We include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute a sales contract with our home buyers, or when we require advance payment from home buyers for custom changes, upgrades, or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the home buyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the provisions of the contracts. We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed, closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. We earn mortgage loan origination fees when we close and fund the loans associated with the homes financed. We defer the earned origination fees, net of direct origination costs, and recognize them as revenues, along with the associated gains or losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans are sold to third party investors. All of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. All of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers. Inventories We use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction. We state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121. In addition to the costs of direct land 11 acquisition, land development and home construction, inventory costs include interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete are charged to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as construction superintendents compensation, advertising and builders risk insurance are either charged to SG&A expense as incurred or, in the case of builders risk insurance, amortized to SG&A expense over the applicable policy periods. We amortize to cost of sales for homes closed all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project. When a home is closed, we usually have not yet recorded and paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we will ultimately pay related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs needed to complete each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each months accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued. Although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimate, our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes. Each quarter, we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home (or project) are recoverable. If our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the SFAS No. 121 guidelines, we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter. To date, such impairment losses have occurred primarily in markets that we have chosen to abandon, and have been insignificant in the aggregate. Fair value estimation under SFAS No. 121 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, it is at least reasonably possible that actual results could differ from such estimates. Warranty Costs Warranty reserves have been established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed. The amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods. The one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten year period is for major construction defects. We have, and require all of our subcontractors to have, general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction product defects, but accrue the warranty costs liability to cover our self insured retentions and deductible amounts under those policies. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. Interest rate swaps We have two interest rate swap agreements with a major United States bank under which we receive each quarter the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and pay a fixed amount that averages 5.1% on a total notional amount of $200 million. We entered into both of the ten year swap contracts in 1998. Because we were unwilling to buy out the banks current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which LIBOR exceeds 7%, we chose not to designate the swaps as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, which we adopted on October 1, 2000. As a result, even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility, we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter. At the end of each quarter, the swaps market value will have changed depending upon the markets current anticipation of quarterly LIBOR rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity in 2008. The swaps market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future LIBOR rates. The declines in short term interest rates in the past two years have resulted in a decline in the swaps market value to a liability of approximately $22.6 million at September 30, 2002. We cannot predict the 12 changes in either future LIBOR rates or the market values of our swaps. Any future reductions in anticipated LIBOR rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements. Goodwill We adopted SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Under its provisions, we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings. Such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption excess of cost over net assets acquired and, in our homebuilding segment, totaled $579.2 million at September 30, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded. We performed such assessments as of October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002, and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. The goodwill assessment procedures required by SFAS No. 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs and due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, it is at least reasonably possible that actual results could differ from such estimates. Stock based compensation With the approval of the Board of Directors, we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock. Our Board of Directors approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders. We grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period. We account for options under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the grants at the time of issuance. SFAS No. 123 requires us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense for the estimated value of the options when granted and the changes in their values over their terms. The SFAS No. 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date. If we had used the Black Scholes formula for valuing option grants made after our adoption of SFAS No. 123, our net income would have been $1.9 million, $2.3 million and $2.7 million less than reported amounts for fiscal 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively, and diluted net income per share would have been $0.02 less than the reported amounts for each of those years. For the present, we have chosen to continue our current method of accounting for stock options until the FASB and or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have formalized and revised requirements for accounting for them in the future. When they do, we will promptly adopt whatever new accounting methods are required. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED We provide homebuilding services in 20 states and 44 markets through our 48 homebuilding divisions. Through our financial services operations, we also provide mortgage banking and title agency services in many of these same markets. Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2001 Consolidated revenues increased 51.2%, to $6,738.8 million in 2002 from $4,455.5 million in 2001, primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues. The increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to $1,507.2 million in revenues generated by Fortress Florida, acquired in May 2001, Emerald Builders, acquired in July 2001, and Schuler Homes, Inc., acquired in February 2002, during the periods in 2002 that were less than one year after each was acquired. Income before income taxes increased 58.8% to $647.5 million in 2002 from $407.8 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, income before income taxes increased 0.4 percentage points, to 9.6%, from 9.2% in 2001. Factors contributing to that improvement were reductions in homebuilding other expense, a 0.1 percentage point improvement in homebuilding SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues, a significantly improved operating margin in our financial services segment, all offset in part by a 0.5 percentage point decline in our homebuilding gross margins. The decline in the homebuilding gross margin was due primarily to sales of 13 inventory acquired in the Schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition. If the acquired inventory had been recorded at Schulers historical cost, rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies, reported homebuilding gross profit would have been greater by approximately $61.1 million (0.9% of homebuilding revenues). The consolidated provision for income taxes increased 58.8% to $242.8 million in 2002, from $152.9 million in 2001, due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate of 37.5% remained the same in both periods. Year Ended September 30, 2001 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2000 Consolidated revenues increased 21.9%, to $4,455.5 million in 2001 from $3,653.7 million in 2000, primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues. The increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to $103.0 million in revenues generated by Fortress Florida, acquired in May 2001, and Emerald Builders, acquired in July 2001. Income before income taxes increased 31.9%, to $407.8 million in 2001 from $309.2 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, income before income taxes increased 0.7 percentage points, to 9.2%, from 8.5% in 2000, primarily due to the increase in gross profit percentage achieved by the homebuilding segment, which was offset in part by write downs to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies and the decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements during the year. The consolidated provision for income taxes increased 30.1%, to $152.9 million in 2001, from $117.5 million in 2000, due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate decreased 0.5 percentage points, to 37.5% in 2001, from 38.0% in 2000, primarily due to changes in the overall effective state income tax rate. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HOMEBUILDING We currently conduct our homebuilding operations in five market regions consisting of the following markets: Mid Atlantic Charleston, Charlotte, Columbia, Greensboro, Greenville, Hilton Head, Maryland D.C., Myrtle Beach, New Jersey, Raleigh/Durham and Virginia D.C. Midwest Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul Southeast Atlanta, Birmingham, Fort Myers/Naples, Jacksonville, Miami/West Palm Beach and Orlando Southwest Albuquerque, Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Killeen, Phoenix, San Antonio and Tucson West Colorado Springs, Denver, Fort Collins, Hawaii, Inland Empire (Southern California), Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Orange County, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle/Tacoma and Ventura County The following tables set forth certain operating and financial data for the Companys homebuilding activities: Percentages of Homebuilding Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2000 2001 2002 Costs and expenses: Cost of sales 81.6 % 80.4 % 81.0 % Selling, general and administrative expense 10.0 9.9 9.8 Interest expense 0.3 0.2 0.1 Total costs and expenses 91.9 90.5 90.9 Other (income)/expense (0.1 ) 0.8 0.2 Income before income taxes 8.2 % 8.7 % 8.9 % 14 Homes Closed Year Ended September 30, 2000 2001 2002 Homes Closed % Homes Closed % Homes Closed % Mid Atlantic 3,042 15.9 % 2,757 12.9 % 2,950 9.9 % Midwest 1,951 10.2 % 1,833 8.6 % 1,911 6.4 % Southeast 2,755 14.4 % 2,882 13.5 % 3,513 11.8 % Southwest 7,721 40.3 % 8,902 41.6 % 11,859 39.9 % West 3,675 19.2 % 4,997 23.4 % 9,528 32.0 % 19,144 100.0 % 21,371 100.0 % 29,761 100.0 % New Net Sales Contracts Year Ended September 30, 2000 2001 2002 Homes Sold  $ Homes Sold  $ Homes Sold  $ ($ in millions) Mid Atlantic 2,774 $ 576.2 2,756 $ 590.0 3,381 $ 700.2 Midwest 1,717 418.7 1,851 481.3 1,909 464.4 Southeast 2,906 501.8 3,007 530.8 3,718 617.0 Southwest 7,829 1,243.2 9,233 1,536.4 12,743 2,131.5 West 3,997 936.5 5,332 1,364.1 9,740 2,972.8 19,223 $ 3,676.4 22,179 $ 4,502.6 31,491 $ 6,885.9 Sales Backlog September 30, 2000 2001 2002 Homes $ Homes $ Homes $ ($ in millions) Mid Atlantic 823 $ 207.6 822 $ 190.3 1,253 $ 264.8 Midwest 900 225.4 918 262.8 916 238.5 Southeast 987 177.8 1,464 253.6 1,669 274.7 Southwest 3,189 551.5 4,235 738.0 5,186 887.8 West 1,489 374.6 1,824 489.1 3,673 1,159.4 7,388 $ 1,536.9 9,263 $ 1,933.8 12,697 $ 2,825.2 Sales backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period, some of which are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval. In the past, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of future closings. Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2001 Revenues from home sales increased 52.2%, to $6,529.6 million (29,761 homes closed) in 2002 from $4,289.8 million (21,371 homes closed) in 2001. Revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 3.0% in the Mid Atlantic region to 125.8% in the West region. The increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets, an increase in the average selling price of homes closed, and the increases attributable to the acquisition of Fortress Florida in May 2001, Emerald Builders in July 2001, and Schuler Homes, Inc. in February 2002. In markets where we operated throughout both twelve month periods, home sales revenues increased by 17.4%, to $5,022.4 million (24,478 homes closed) in 2002 from $4,279.3 million (21,328 homes closed) in 2001. 15 The average selling price of homes we closed during 2002 was $219,400, up 9.3% from $200,700 in 2001. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price ($334,400) of the 3,662 homes closed by the former Schuler divisions, which operate in the western part of the United States with higher prevailing home prices. Excluding Schuler closings, the average selling price of homes we closed was $203,300, up 1.3% from 2001. The value of new net sales contracts increased 52.9%, to $6,885.9 million (31,491 homes) in 2002 from $4,502.6 million (22,179 homes) in 2001. The value of new net sales contracts increased in four of our five market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 16.2% in the Southeast to 117.9% in the West. The value of new net sales contracts declined 3.5% in the Midwest. Although our two primary markets in the Midwest (Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul) remain strong, we ceased operations in Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis in 2002, which contributed to the slight decline in new net sales contracts in that region. The overall increase in the value of new net sales contracts was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets, as well as sales achieved by Fortress Florida, Emerald Builders and Schuler Homes. In markets where we operated throughout both fiscal years, the value of new net sales contracts increased 18.9%, to $5,343.5 million, and the number of new net sales contracts increased 16.3%, to 25,762 homes. The average price of a new net sales contract in 2002 was $218,700, up 7.7% over the $203,000 average in 2001. The increase in average selling price was primarily due to the higher average selling price ($327,100) of the 3,666 homes sold by the former Schuler divisions, which operate in the western part of the United States with higher prevailing home prices. Excluding the Schuler sales, our average selling price of homes sold in 2002 was $204,400, up 0.7% from 2001. At September 30, 2002, our backlog of sales contracts was $2,825.2 million (12,697 homes), up 46.1% from $1,933.8 million (9,263 homes) at September 30, 2001. In markets where we operated at the end of both fiscal years, our backlog of sales contracts increased 20.7%, to $2,333.7 (11,070 homes). The average sales price of homes in backlog was $222,500 at September 30, 2002, up 6.6% from the $208,800 average at September 30, 2001. As with the average selling prices of homes closed and sold, the increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog was primarily due to the effect of homes in the backlogs of the former Schuler divisions, which operate in the western part of the United States with higher prevailing home prices. Excluding the Schuler amounts, the average price of homes in our backlog was $210,800, up 1.0% from 2001. Cost of sales increased by 52.1%, to $5,364.4 million in 2002 from $3,527.1 million in 2001. The increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues. Cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 0.5 percentage points, to 80.9% in 2002, from 80.4% in 2001. The benefits we achieved in 2002 from our continuing ability to raise prices in selected markets and reduce costs through our national purchasing program were offset by sales of inventory acquired in the Schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition. If the acquired inventory had been recorded at Schulers historical cost, rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies, reported gross profit from home sales would have been greater by approximately $54.0 million (0.8% of home sales revenues). All of the significant purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Schuler acquisition were recorded in 2002. For essentially the same reasons as mentioned, total homebuilding cost of sales was 81.0% of total homebuilding revenue, up 0.6 percentage points from 80.4% in 2001. We do not expect future cost of sales to be materially affected by charges associated with the Schuler merger. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 49.7%, to $646.8 million in 2002 from $432.0 million in 2001. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased to 9.8% in 2002 from 9.9% in 2001. The 0.1 percentage point decline in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the increased leverage of fixed SG&A expenses achieved by the increases in homebuilding revenues. Interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to $6.0 million in 2002 from $8.8 million in 2001. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, homebuilding interest expense decreased to 0.1% in 2002 from 0.2% in 2001. Due to the declining interest rate environment experienced in 2002, our total interest costs as 16 a percentage of average interest bearing debt declined. Also, throughout 2002, inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interest bearing debt. Therefore, a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2001. We follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development. During both years, we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory. Capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time homes are closed. Other expense associated with homebuilding activities was $16.9 million in 2002, as compared to $34.7 million in 2001. The expense in 2002 is primarily due to a $12.3 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and a $6.6 million write down to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies. The expense in 2001 was primarily due to a $13.8 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and a $22.9 million write down of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies. Year Ended September 30, 2001 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2000 Revenues from home sales increased 22.7%, to $4,289.8 million (21,371 homes closed) in 2001 from $3,496.1 million (19,144 homes closed) in 2000. Revenues from home sales increased in four of our five market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 0.8% in the Midwest region to 53.4% in the West region. Home sales revenues declined 0.7% in the Mid Atlantic region. The increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets, and an increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well as the increases attributable to the acquisition of Fortress Florida in May 2001 and Emerald Builders in July 2001. In markets where we operated throughout both twelve month periods, home sales revenues increased by 19.9%, to $4,188.7 million (20,748 homes closed) in 2001 from $3,494.9 million (19,138 homes closed) in 2000. The average selling price of homes closed during 2001was $200,700, up 9.9% from $182,600 in 2000. The increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes closed and, with the strong housing demand, our ability to sell more custom features with our homes and to raise prices in some of our markets. The value of new net sales contracts increased 22.5%, to $4,502.6 million (22,179 homes) in 2001 from $3,676.4 million (19,223 homes) in 2000. The value of new net sales contracts increased in all of our five market regions, with percentage increases ranging from 2.4% in the Mid Atlantic to 45.7% in the West. The overall increase in the value of new net sales contracts was due to strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets, as well as sales achieved by Fortress Florida and Emerald Builders. In markets where we operated throughout both fiscal years, the value of new net sales contracts increased 19.5%, to $4,391.0 million, and the number of new net sales contracts increased 12.0%, to 21,518 homes. The average price of a new net sales contract in 2001 was $203,000, up 6.1% over the $191,300 average in 2000. The increase in average selling price was due to changes in the mix of homes sold and, with the strong housing demand, our ability to sell more custom features with our homes and to raise prices in some of our markets. At September 30, 2001, our backlog of sales contracts was $1,933.8 million (9,263 homes), up 25.8% from $1,536.9 million (7,388 homes) at September 30, 2000. In markets where we operated at the end of both fiscal years, our backlog of sales contracts increased 14.4%, to $1,758.1 (8,229 homes). The average sales price of homes in backlog was $208,800 at September 30, 2001, up 0.4% from the $208,000 average at September 30, 2000. Cost of sales increased by 19.9%, to $3,527.1 million in 2001 from $2,941.1 million in 2000. The increase in cost of sales was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues. Cost of home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues declined 1.0 percentage point, to 80.4% in 2001, from 81.4% in 2000, as we continued to benefit from increased prices, savings achieved in our national purchasing program and lower material costs. Total homebuilding cost of sales was 80.4% of total homebuilding revenue, down 1.2 percentage points from 81.6% in 2000. 17 Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 19.9%, to $432.0 million in 2001 from $360.4 million in 2000. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased to 9.9% in 2001 from 10.0% in 2000, primarily as a result of a 0.2 percentage point decline in salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of revenues. Interest expense associated with homebuilding activities decreased to $8.8 million in 2001 from $10.2 million in 2000. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, homebuilding interest expense decreased to 0.2% in 2001 from 0.3% in 2000. Throughout 2001, inventory under construction or development grew at a more rapid pace than interest bearing debt. Therefore, a larger proportion of total interest incurred was capitalized to inventory than in 2000. We follow a policy of capitalizing interest only on inventory under construction or development. During both years, we expensed the portion of incurred interest and other financing costs which could not be charged to inventory. Capitalized interest and other financing costs are included in cost of sales at the time of home closings. Other expense associated with homebuilding activities was $34.7 million in 2001, compared to $2.1 million of other income in 2000. The expense in 2001 is primarily due to a $22.9 million write down to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies and a $13.8 million decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements.

The following table summarizes financial and other information for the Companys financial services operations: Year Ended September 30, 2000 2001 2002 Financial Services: ($ in thousands) Number of loans originated 9,151 13,347 20,421 Loan origination fees $ 9,981 $ 14,748 $ 22,336 Sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages 21,271 32,905 55,045 Other revenues 4,529 7,711 11,182 Total mortgage banking revenues 35,781 55,364 88,563 Title policy premiums, net 13,741 16,598 25,029 Total revenues 49,522 71,962 113,592 General and administrative expenses 35,470 47,387 67,771 Interest expense 5,616 5,288 5,505 Interest/other (income) (6,257 ) (7,669 ) (16,107 ) Income before income taxes $ 14,693 $ 26,956 $ 56,423 Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2001 Revenues from the financial services segment increased 57.8%, to $113.6 million in 2002 from $72.0 million in 2001. The increase in financial services revenues was due to the rapid expansion of our mortgage loan and title services provided to customers of our homebuilding segment and the effects of the Fortress Florida and Emerald Builders acquisitions. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 43.0%, to $67.8 million in 2002 from $47.4 million in 2001. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased by 6.2 percentage points to 59.7% in 2002 from 65.9% in 2001, due primarily to efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated in markets we entered in 2001. 18 Year Ended September 30, 2001 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2000 Revenues from the financial services segment increased 45.3% to $72.0 million in 2001 from $49.5 million in 2000. The increase in financial services revenues was due to the continued expansion of our mortgage loan and title services provided to customers of our homebuilding segment. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 33.6%, to $47.4 million in 2001 from $35.5 million in 2000. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased by 5.7 percentage points to 65.9% in 2001 from 71.6% in 2000, primarily from efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated in markets entered in 2000. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At September 30, 2002, we had available cash and cash equivalents of $104.3 million. Inventories (including finished homes, construction in progress, and developed residential lots and other land) at September 30, 2002, had increased by $1,538.7 million from September 30, 2001, due to a general increase in business activity, the acquisition of Schuler Homes, Inc. and the expansion of operations in our market areas. The inventory increase was financed largely by issuing senior notes and by retaining earnings. Our revolving credit facility had no amounts outstanding at September 30, 2002 and 2001. Our ratio of homebuilding notes payable (net of cash) to total capital at September 30, 2002 improved 2.7 percentage points, to 51.3% from 54.0% at September 30, 2001. The stockholders equity to total assets ratio increased 3.5 percentage points, to 37.7% at September 30, 2002, from 34.2% at September 30, 2001. We refinanced our existing unsecured revolving credit facility in fiscal 2002 with a new, replacement facility. The new $805 million facility includes $125 million which may be used for letters of credit. The new facility matures in January 2006, and is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment. At September 30, 2002, we had outstanding homebuilding debt of $2,487.0 million. Under the debt covenants associated with the revolving credit facility, our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under it is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility, $697.1 million at September 30, 2002, or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our inventory. At September 30, 2002, the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to $1,242.1 million. At September 30, 2002, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility. We have entered into multi year interest rate swap agreements, aggregating a notional amount of $200 million, that have the effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate revolving credit facility at 5.1%. On February 21, 2002, Schuler Homes, Inc. merged with and into D.R. Horton, Inc., with D.R. Horton the surviving corporation. At the time of the merger, Schulers assets amounted to $1,393.3 million, mostly inventory. The total merger consideration consisted of the issuance of 20,079,532 shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. common stock, valued at $30.93 per share (the average closing price of D.R. Horton common stock for a period of ten trading days from December 4, 2001 to December 17, 2001); the payment of $168.7 million in cash; the assumption of $802.2 million of Schulers debt, $238.2 million of which was paid at closing; the assumption of trade payables and other liabilities amounting to $227.6 million; and the assumption of $10.8 million of obligations to the Schuler entities minority interest holders. Also, D.R. Horton issued options to purchase approximately 527,000 shares of D.R. Horton common stock to Schuler employees to replace outstanding Schuler stock options. The fair value of the options issued was $10.4 million and was recorded as additional capital. The fair value of the unvested options issued was $6.0 million and was recorded as unearned compensation. The unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the stock options. The fair value of the options was estimated using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The Schuler merger was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, Schulers assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangibles, were initially recorded at their fair values as of the date of the merger. The excess of the 19 total consideration paid over the net assets fair value (approximately $441.9 million) was recorded as an addition to goodwill. On April 11, 2002, we issued $250 million of 8% senior notes due 2012. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility. These notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment. On February 21, 2002, we assumed the outstanding debt of Schuler Homes, Inc. as part of Schulers merger with us. The debt assumed included 9% senior notes due 2008, 9 3/8% senior notes due 2009 and 10% senior subordinated notes due 2011, all of which we recorded at their respective market values as of February 21, 2002. As required by their indentures in the event of a change of control, we offered to redeem all of the Schuler notes at 101% of their par amount, plus accrued interest. In connection with that offer, we redeemed $20.2 million in principal amount of the Schuler senior and senior subordinated notes. We examine the carrying value of our excess cost over net assets acquired (goodwill) annually to determine whether there are any impairment losses. Impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. Our consolidated goodwill amounted to $579.2 million (homebuilding) and $1.2 million (financial services) at September 30, 2002. We performed the required tests at October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002 and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset impairments existed. At September 30, 2002, the financial services segment had mortgage loans held for sale of $464.1 million and loan commitments for $279.3 million at fixed rates. We hedge the interest rate market risk on these mortgage loans held for sale and loan commitments through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, forward sales of mortgage backed securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments. We record gains or losses related to such hedging instruments in other income as their market value changes. Such gains and losses have not significantly affected our financial services results of operations. As of September 30, 2002, the financial services segment had a $300 million, one year mortgage warehouse bank facility that matures on August 12, 2003, and is secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale. The mortgage warehouse facility is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. At September 30, 2002, $242.4 million had been drawn under the mortgage warehouse facility. Our wholly owned mortgage company completed a new $100 million mortgage backed commercial paper conduit facility (CP conduit facility) in July 2002. The facility was increased to $150 million in August 2002. Although the agreement governing the CP conduit facility expires on July 3, 2005, maintenance of the facility beyond the first (and subsequent) anniversary date(s) must be annually approved by the sponsoring bank. The CP conduit facility is also secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. As of September 30, 2002, $149.0 million had been drawn under the new facility. The mortgage loans pledged to secure the new facility are used as collateral for mortgage backed securities sold by the sponsoring bank in the secondary commercial paper markets at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to the mortgage warehouse facility. All mortgage company activities are financed under the mortgage warehouse and CP conduit facilities. Both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance. Subsequent to September 30, 2002, the mortgage warehouse facility was reduced to $200 million and the CP conduit facility was increased to $200 million. Our historical strategy of internal growth and growth by acquisitions has required significant amounts of cash. If we are to achieve our future growth targets, we expect that those cash requirements will continue. We anticipate that future home construction, lot and land purchases and any acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds, existing and future credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities. At September 30, 2002, under currently effective shelf registration statements, we had approximately 15 million shares of common stock issuable to effect, in whole or in part, possible future acquisitions and the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to $1.0 billion. On December 3, 2002, we used the $1.0 billion 20 shelf registration statement to issue $215 million 7.5% senior notes due 2007, leaving the unused shelf registration statement amount at $785 million. The $214.2 million net proceeds of the December senior note offering were used to pay down amounts borrowed under our bank revolving credit facility. On May 11, 2003, the holders of our zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 will have an opportunity to require us to purchase their notes for cash at their accreted value of $559.73 per note on that date. If all of the note holders elect to require us to purchase all of their notes, we will be required to purchase notes having a total accreted value of $213.3 million on that date. In the future, we intend to continue to maintain effective shelf registration statements that will facilitate access to the capital markets. We believe that our current cash position, our cash generation capabilities, the amounts available under our revolving line of credit agreements and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner with our existing shelf registration statement are adequate to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future. During fiscal 2002, our Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per common share, the last of which was paid on August 23, 2002 to stockholders of record on August 9, 2002. At September 30, 2002, we had $63.1 million remaining on a Board of Directors authorization for repurchases of our common stock. On November 21, 2002, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized for repurchases of our debt from $100 million to $150 million. In 1999 and 2000, we entered into three separate limited partnership agreements with the purpose of investing in start up and emerging growth companies whose technology and business plans had the potential of permitting us to leverage our size, expertise and customer base in the homebuilding industry. We originally authorized investment of up to $125 million in such companies over a four year period. In January 2001, the original $125 million authorization was reduced to the $31.3 million that had been invested in such companies as of that date. The investments are concentrated in e commerce businesses that serve the homebuilding, real estate and financial service industries, as well as in businesses whose strategic focus allowed for the diversification of our operations. As of September 30, 2002, the carrying value of our investments in such companies, all accounted for under the cost method and reported in homebuilding other assets, amounted to $4.9 million. Except for ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes, the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes, at September 30, 2002, we had no material commitments for capital expenditures. INFLATION We and the homebuilding industry in general, may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land and construction costs. Inflation also increases our financing, labor and material costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT Certain statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate, believe, expect, estimate, project and future. Any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or 21 public statements may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward looking statements. The following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us. Other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us. General Economic, Real Estate and Other Conditions The homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, such as employment levels, availability of financing for home buyers, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. Any oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties and used homes, could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes. Homebuilders are also subject to risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding, the availability and cost of materials and labor, adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules and cost overruns. Increases in Interest Rates or Decreases in Mortgage Availability Virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing. Any future increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could depress the market for new homes by making our homes less affordable. Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and homebuilding process, including zoning, density and building standards. Such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. This can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding. Laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays, increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas. Substantial Debt We have a significant amount of debt. The amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other requirements. It could also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions. Competitive Conditions The homebuilding industry is very competitive. In each of the markets we serve, we compete with other homebuilders for home buyers, desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices, the need for increased selling incentives, lower sales or delays in construction. Availability of Capital Our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to obtain capital from the sale of equity or debt or additional bank borrowings. Increases in interest rates, changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies, concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy, changing lending objectives of financial institutions, or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives. Moreover, the indentures for our outstanding debt contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future. Growth Strategies Since 1993, we have acquired many homebuilding companies. Although we are currently focusing on internal growth, we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future. Successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available. Although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past, we can give no assurance that, when we resume our acquisition activity, we will be able to successfully identify, acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future. Moreover, we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K should be consulted. 22 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. Our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 when it was adopted on October 1, 2000. We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps and such changes must be reflected in our income statements. Our financial services segment is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services. Most mortgage loans are funded at fixed interest rates before they are committed to third party investors. Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, IRLCs will have a duration of less than six months. Forward sales of mortgage backed securities are designated as fair value hedges against the risk of changes to the overall fair value of funded loans. Accordingly, changes in the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings, as are the changes in the value of the funded loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedge is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the years ended September 30, 2001 and 2002, was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. Interest rate risk associated with IRLCs is managed through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, forward sales of mortgage backed securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments. Both the IRLCs and these instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair market value with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. At September 30, 2002, forward sales of mortgage backed securities related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and IRLCs totaled approximately $229.5 million. At September 30, 2002, the fair value of the net forward sales and IRLCs was $0.2 million. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2002, for our debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value. In addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value of our interest rate swaps.

Horton, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
