ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Critical Accounting Policies General A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2004 and 2003, and for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for public companies operating in the United States of America. In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected. Basis of presentation Our financial statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts, under the requirements of Interpretation No. 46 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Segment information Our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in 21 states and 63 markets throughout the United States. The financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets. We have no foreign subsidiaries or operations. Revenue recognition We recognize homebuilding revenues when a home closes and title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. Virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing. We include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract. We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed, closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers. We recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. Origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as revenues, along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans are sold. We sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors. Inventories and Cost of Sales We state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144. In addition to the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, inventory costs include interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of construction superintendents, sales personnel and division and region management, advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. 13 Table of Contents We use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project. When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each months accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued. Although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future could differ from our current estimate, our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes. Each quarter, we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable. If our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the SFAS No. 144 guidelines, we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter. To date, such impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate. Fair value estimation under SFAS No. 144 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities as amended (FIN 46). FIN 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities, which FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits are non refundable. Certain non refundable deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the requirements of FIN 46. As such, certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option. In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated. Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to FIN 46, we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. 14 Table of Contents Warranty Costs We have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods. The one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten year period is for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. Insurance Claim Costs We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. We reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported. Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices, and legal interpretations, among others. Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. Interest rate swaps We have two interest rate swap agreements with a major United States bank under which we receive each quarter the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and pay a fixed amount that averages 5.1% on a total notional amount of $200 million. We entered into both of the ten year swap contracts in 1998. Because we were unwilling to buy out the banks current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which LIBOR exceeds 7%, we chose not to designate the swaps as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133. As a result, even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility, we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter. At the end of each quarter, the swaps market value will have changed depending upon the markets current anticipation of quarterly LIBOR rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity in 2008. The swaps market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future LIBOR rates. Any future reductions in anticipated LIBOR rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements. Similarly, any future increases in anticipated LIBOR rates could result in corresponding future increases in their market value and increases in our reported earnings. We cannot predict the changes in either future LIBOR rates or the market values of our swaps. Goodwill We adopted SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Under its provisions, we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings. Such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption Goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded. We have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists. We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill assessment procedures required by SFAS No. 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates. Stock based compensation With the approval of a committee consisting of independent members of our Board of Directors, we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders. We grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period. We account for options under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board 15 Table of Contents (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the grants. SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, (SFAS No. 123) and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, (SFAS No. 148) require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123. The SFAS No. 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date. In March 2004, the FASB issued a Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standard which would amend SFAS No. 123 and require companies that issue share based payments to record compensation expense based on the fair value of the share based payment. We will adopt the proposed statement when it becomes effective, and we do not expect this change in accounting principle to materially affect our results of operations in future periods. Results of Operations Overview We experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, driven primarily by the continued growth of our homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in homebuilding profit margins. The demand from first time and move up homebuyers has remained favorable. Population growth, demographics, immigration, household formations and changes in home ownership rates were the primary long term factors driving this housing demand, with particular strength in our Southeast, Southwest and West regions. Low mortgage rates were a positive influence on housing demand during 2004 and 2003, during a period of generally weak employment levels. In addition, because the homebuilding industry in the United States is highly fragmented, we have been able to capitalize on the benefits of our size, such as our capital strength and access to lower material, labor and capital costs, to generate continued growth by increasing market share. The mortgage industry was negatively impacted by a decline in loan refinancing activity during 2004. This resulted in increased competitive conditions and lower margins in the mortgage markets, including the market for mortgage loans for new home construction. Key financial highlights for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: Homebuilding Operations: Our homebuilding operations generated year over year increases in the value of net new sales orders, homes closed and revenues exceeding 20% in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Homebuilding operating margins increased by 3.5 and 1.8 percentage points during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to improvements in homebuilding gross margins and control of overhead costs. Homebuilding pre tax income increased 65% and 55% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our sales backlog at September 30, 2004 was $4.6 billion, a fiscal year end record and 25% higher than our backlog at September 30, 2003. Homebuilding debt to total capitalization (net of cash), which is calculated as homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity), was 38.9% at September 30, 2004, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from the prior year, and an all time low for the Company. Financial Services Operations: Total financial services revenues increased 4% and 55% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflecting the focus of our mortgage and title operations on supporting our growing homebuilding 16 Table of Contents business, offset by the effects of increased competition in the mortgage industry for new home loans in fiscal 2004. Financial services pre tax income declined by 20% in fiscal 2004 after having increased by 66% in fiscal 2003, due to lower operating margins caused by the competitive conditions in the mortgage industry and changes in the product mix of mortgage loans originated and sold in 2004. Consolidated Results: Net income increased 56% and 55% in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively, due to the improvements in consolidated revenues and homebuilding operating margins. Diluted earnings per share increased 51% and 43% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2004 was 38.4%, as compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2003 and 37.5% in fiscal 2002. The increases in our effective income tax rates in 2004 and 2003 were due primarily to increases in pre tax income in states with higher state income tax rates. Our operating strategy for fiscal 2005 and future years is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business, while continuing to generate profitability improvements and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process. Results of Operations Homebuilding Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2003 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003: Net New Sales Orders Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Homes Sold Value ($s in Millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change Mid Atlantic 4,032 3,594 12% $ 1,009.7 $ 780.8 29% $ 250,400 $ 217,300 15% Midwest 2,261 2,067 9% 634.5 553.6 15% 280,600 267,800 5% Southeast 6,301 4,528 39% 1,375.8 863.3 59% 218,300 190,700 14% Southwest 18,146 15,699 16% 3,086.7 2,614.7 18% 170,100 166,600 2% West 14,523 12,837 13% 5,299.5 4,349.9 22% 364,900 338,900 8% 45,263 38,725 17% $ 11,406.2 $ 9,162.3 24% $ 252,000 $ 236,600 7% Sales Backlog As of September 30, Homes in Backlog Value ($s in Millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change Mid Atlantic 1,740 1,602 9 % $ 492.2 $ 370.9 33 % $ 282,900 $ 231,500 22% Midwest 861 981 (12 )% 269.7 278.9 (3 )% 313,200 284,300 10% Southeast 2,987 1,823 64 % 698.6 364.1 92 % 233,900 199,700 17% Southwest 6,632 6,676 (1 )% 1,195.3 1,120.9 7 % 180,200 167,900 7% West 4,964 4,406 13 % 1,912.7 1,518.6 26 % 385,300 344,700 12% 17,184 15,488 11 % $ 4,568.5 $ 3,653.4 25 % $ 265,900 $ 235,900 13% 17 Table of Contents Homes Closed Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Home Sales Revenues Homes Closed ($s in Millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change Mid Atlantic 3,894 3,245 20% $ 888.4 $ 674.8 32% $ 228,100 $ 208,000 10 % Midwest 2,381 2,002 19% 643.7 513.2 25% 270,300 256,300 5 % Southeast 5,137 4,374 17% 1,041.3 773.9 35% 202,700 176,900 15 % Southwest 18,190 14,209 28% 3,012.3 2,381.5 26% 165,600 167,600 (1 )% West 13,965 12,104 15% 4,905.4 3,990.7 23% 351,300 329,700 7 % 43,567 35,934 21% $ 10,491.1 $ 8,334.1 26% $ 240,800 $ 231,900 4 % Homebuilding Operating Margin Analysis Percentages of Homebuilding Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2004 2003 Gross profit 23.1 % 20.4 % Selling, general and administrative expense 9.0 9.6 Interest and other (income) expense (0.1 ) 0.1 Income before income taxes 14.2 % 10.7 % Net new sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of sales contract cancellations, during the year. The value of net new sales orders increased 24%, to $11,406.2 million (45,263 homes) in 2004 from $9,162.3 million (38,725 homes) in 2003. The average price of a net new sales order in 2004 was $252,000, up 7% from the $236,600 average in 2003. The number of homes sold, value and the average price of net new sales orders increased in each of our market regions during 2004 due to the successful execution of our growth strategies and generally strong demand for our homes in all of our market regions. The largest increases in the value of net new sales orders occurred in the Southeast and Mid Atlantic regions, which is a result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our Florida, Virginia and Maryland markets, where housing demand is strong. The increase in our average selling price reflects our ability to increase prices in the markets where demand for our homes is strongest, while we continue our efforts to ensure that our product offerings and prices remain affordable for our target customers, typically first time and move up homebuyers, in most of our markets. Sales backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period, some of which are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval, that can result in cancellations. In the past, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of future closings, although contracts in backlog may not all result in closings. At September 30, 2004, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $4,568.5 million (17,184 homes), up 25% from $3,653.4 million (15,488 homes) at September 30, 2003. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $265,900 at September 30, 2004, up 13% from the $235,900 average at September 30, 2003. The value of our sales backlog increased in four of our five market regions, led by a 92% increase in the Southeast region, which is a result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our Florida markets. The average selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market regions, reflecting the generally strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2004 which allowed us to increase prices. Revenues from home sales increased 26%, to $10,491.1 million (43,567 homes closed) in 2004 from $8,334.1 million (35,934 homes closed) in 2003. Revenues from home sales increased by more than 20% 18 Table of Contents in all of our five market regions, and the number of homes closed increased by 15% or more in all market regions as well, reflecting the successful execution of our growth strategies and our homebuilding divisions ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers. The average selling price of homes we closed during 2004 was $240,800, up 4% from $231,900 in 2003. The average selling price of homes closed increased in four of our five market regions, with the largest increases occurring in the Southeast and Mid Atlantic regions. Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 41%, to $2,460.7 million in 2004 from $1,746.3 million in 2003. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 2.7 percentage points, to 23.1% in 2004, from 20.4% in 2003. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 2.2 percentage points, to 22.8% in 2004, from 20.6% in 2003, which is attributable to our ability to increase home prices due to strong demand for our homes in many of our markets and our ongoing efforts to control and reduce construction costs as we achieve greater economies of scale. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 17%, to $959.0 million in 2004 from $817.0 million in 2003. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 0.6 percentage points, to 9.0% in 2004 from 9.6% in 2003. The improvement in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues is attributable to our ongoing cost control efforts and our ability to generate higher revenue levels that better leverage our existing fixed SG&A costs. Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 1%, to $236.7 million in 2004 from $239.5 million in 2003. Our average homebuilding debt increased 5% in 2004 from 2003; however, during the past two years we have replaced certain of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates and we have restructured and amended our unsecured revolving credit facility, which lowered our interest costs, resulting in this slight decrease in interest incurred in 2004. We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both years our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. Interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 13% to $249.0 million in 2004 from $219.4 million in 2003. This increase was attributable to a 20% increase in total cost of sales, partially offset by the effects of the decline in interest incurred. Other income associated with homebuilding activities was $9.9 million in 2004, compared to other expense of $9.4 million in 2003. The major component of other income in 2004 was an increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $8.1 million. The major component of other expense in 2003 was $11.8 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures. Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared to Year Ended September, 30 2002 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002: Net New Sales Orders Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Homes Sold Value ($s in Millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2003 2002 Change 2003 2002 Change 2003 2002 Change Mid Atlantic 3,594 3,381 6% $ 780.8 $ 700.2 12% $ 217,300 $ 207,100 5 % Midwest 2,067 1,909 8% 553.6 464.4 19% 267,800 243,300 10 % Southeast 4,528 3,718 22% 863.3 617.0 40% 190,700 165,900 15 % Southwest 15,699 12,743 23% 2,614.7 2,131.5 23% 166,600 167,300 % West 12,837 9,740 32% 4,349.9 2,972.8 46% 338,900 305,200 11 % 38,725 31,491 23% $ 9,162.3 $ 6,885.9 33% $ 236,600 $ 218,700 8 % 19 Table of Contents Sales Backlog As of September 30, Homes in Backlog Value ($s in Millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2003 2002 Change 2003 2002 Change 2003 2002 Change Mid Atlantic 1,602 1,253 28% $ 370.9 $ 264.8 40% $ 231,500 $ 211,300 10 % Midwest 981 916 7% 278.9 238.5 17% 284,300 260,400 9 % Southeast 1,823 1,669 9% 364.1 274.7 33% 199,700 164,600 21 % Southwest 6,676 5,186 29% 1,120.9 887.8 26% 167,900 171,200 (2 )% West 4,406 3,673 20% 1,518.6 1,159.4 31% 344,700 315,700 9 % 15,488 12,697 22% $ 3,653.4 $ 2,825.2 29% $ 235,900 $ 222,500 6 % Homes Closed Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Home Sales Revenues Homes Closed ($s in Millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2003 2002 Change 2003 2002 Change 2003 2002 Change Mid Atlantic 3,245 2,950 10% $ 674.8 $ 625.7 8% $ 208,000 $ 212,100 (2 )% Midwest 2,002 1,911 5% 513.2 488.7 5% 256,300 255,700 % Southeast 4,374 3,513 25% 773.9 595.8 30% 176,900 169,600 4 % Southwest 14,209 11,859 20% 2,381.5 1,997.3 19% 167,600 168,400 % West 12,104 9,528 27% 3,990.7 2,822.1 41% 329,700 296,200 11 % 35,934 29,761 21% $ 8,334.1 $ 6,529.6 28% $ 231,900 $ 219,400 6 % Homebuilding Operating Margin Analysis Percentages of Homebuilding Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2003 2002 Gross profit 20.4 % 19.0 % Selling, general and administrative expense 9.6 9.8 Interest and other expense 0.1 0.3 Income before income taxes 10.7 % 8.9 % The value of net new sales orders increased 33%, to $9,162.3 million (38,725 homes) in 2003 from $6,885.9 million (31,491 homes) in 2002. The value of net new sales orders increased in all of our five market regions, with the largest percentage increases occurring in the West and Southeast regions. The overall increase in the value of net new sales orders was due to generally strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets and the Schuler acquisition. Excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of Schuler prior to the February 21, 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition, the value of net new sales orders increased 23%, to $8,452.9 million, and the number of net new sales orders increased 17%, to 36,706 homes. The average price of a net new sales order in 2003 was $236,600, up 8% over the $218,700 average in 2002. The increase in average selling price was due primarily to the increase in net new sales orders in the West region, to 33% of the total net new sales orders in 2003 from 31% of net new sales orders in 2002. In the West region, average selling prices are higher than in any of our other market regions. 20 Table of Contents At September 30, 2003, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $3,653.4 million (15,488 homes), up 29% from $2,825.2 million (12,697 homes) at September 30, 2002. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $235,900 at September 30, 2003, up 6% from the $222,500 average at September 30, 2002. The value of our sales backlog increased in all five of our market regions, reflecting our continued execution of our growth strategies in each region and the generally strong demand for our homes in the majority of our markets. Revenues from home sales increased 28%, to $8,334.1 million (35,934 homes closed) in 2003 from $6,529.6 million (29,761 homes closed) in 2002. Revenues from home sales increased in all of our five market regions, with the largest percentage increases occurring in the West and Southeast regions. The increases in both revenues and homes closed were due to generally strong housing demand throughout the majority of our markets and the acquisition of Schuler. Excluding the fiscal 2003 activities of Schuler prior to the February 21, 2003 anniversary date of the acquisition, home sales revenues increased 20% to $7,856.0 million (34,410 homes closed) in 2003 from $6,529.6 million (29,761 homes closed) in 2002. The average selling price of homes we closed during 2003 was $231,900, up 6% from $219,400 in 2002. The increase in average selling price was due primarily to the increase in homes closed in the West region, to 34% of total homes closed in 2003 from 32% of homes closed in 2002. In the West region, average selling prices are higher than in any of our other market regions. Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 39%, to $1,746.3 million in 2003 from $1,260.8 million in 2002. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 1.4 percentage points, to 20.4% in 2003, from 19.0% in 2002. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 1.5 percentage points, to 20.6% in 2003, from 19.1% in 2002. Most of the costs associated with the sales of inventory acquired in the Schuler acquisition, with lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of acquisition, was recognized in 2002. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 26%, to $817.0 million in 2003 from $646.8 million in 2002. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 0.2 percentage points, to 9.6% in 2003 from 9.8% in 2002. The improvement in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to our cost control efforts and the increased leverage of fixed SG&A expenses achieved by the increase in homebuilding revenues. Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 20%, to $239.5 million in 2003 from $198.8 million in 2002. Our average homebuilding debt increased 14% in 2003 from 2002. During 2003 we incurred a full year of interest associated with the homebuilding debt acquired in the Schuler acquisition, which is fixed rate debt with higher interest rates than most of our other debt. We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During 2003 our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. During 2002, we expensed the portion of the interest related to interest bearing debt in excess of our inventory under construction or development. Interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 61% to $219.4 million in 2003 from $136.2 million in 2002 while total cost of sales increased only 27% in 2003. The disproportionately large increase in interest to total cost of sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was attributable to the 2002 closings related to the Schuler acquisition that had little or no capitalized interest associated with them. Other expense associated with homebuilding activities was $9.4 million in 2003, compared to $16.9 million in 2002. The expense in 2003 is primarily due to $11.8 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures. Additionally, $4.2 million of expense was recorded to write down to estimated fair value the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies, which was offset by $3.6 million in interest income and a $1.8 million increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps. The expense in 2002 was primarily due to a $12.3 million decline in the fair 21 Table of Contents value of our interest rate swaps and a $6.6 million write down to estimated fair value of the carrying amounts of our investments in start up and emerging growth companies. Results of Operations Financial Services Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2003 Year Ended September 30, 2004 2003 % Change ($s In millions) Number of loans originated 33,621 29,169 15 % Loan origination fees $ 35.4 $ 33.1 7 % Sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages 87.5 91.5 (4 )% Other revenues 23.2 16.9 37 % Total mortgage banking revenues 146.1 141.5 3 % Title policy premiums, net 36.7 34.5 6 % Total revenues 182.8 176.0 4 % General and administrative expenses 121.0 98.3 23 % Interest expense 5.9 7.4 (20 )% Other (income) (18.8 ) (23.2 ) (19 )% Income before income taxes $ 74.7 $ 93.5 (20 )% Percentages of Financial Services Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2004 2003 General and administrative expense 66.2 % 55.9 % Interest expense 3.2 % 4.2 % Other (income) (10.3 )% (13.2 )% Income before income taxes 40.9 % 53.1 % Revenues from the financial services segment increased 4%, to $182.8 million in 2004 from $176.0 million in 2003. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding operations, offset by a decline in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan. The decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan was primarily due to a shift in the product mix of mortgage loans originated and sold from higher margin fixed rate loans to lower margin adjustable rate loans, and increased competition due to excess capacity in the mortgage industry, which has reduced the margins on all mortgage loans. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 23%, to $121.0 million in 2004 from $98.3 million in 2003. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses increased by 10.3 percentage points, to 66.2% in 2004 from 55.9% in 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the related decrease in income before income taxes were due primarily to the decline in average mortgage revenues earned per loan and increased costs associated with strengthening our financial services infrastructure to support our growing homebuilding business and expanding our mortgage operations into California. 22 Table of Contents Year Ended September 30, 2003 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2002 Year Ended September 30, 2003 2002 % Change ($s In millions) Number of loans originated 29,169 20,421 43% Loan origination fees $ 33.1 $ 22.3 48% Sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages 91.5 55.1 66% Other revenues 16.9 11.2 51% Total mortgage banking revenues 141.5 88.6 60% Title policy premiums, net 34.5 25.0 38% Total revenues 176.0 113.6 55% General and administrative expenses 98.3 67.8 45% Interest expense 7.4 5.5 35% Other (income) (23.2 ) (16.1 ) 44% Income before income taxes $ 93.5 $ 56.4 66% Percentages of Financial Services Revenues Year Ended September 30, 2003 2002 General and administrative expense 55.9 % 59.7 % Interest expense 4.2 % 4.8 % Other (income) (13.2 )% (14.2 )% Income before income taxes 53.1 % 49.6 % Revenues from the financial services segment increased 55%, to $176.0 million in 2003 from $113.6 million in 2002. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding operations and an increase in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 45%, to $98.3 million in 2003 from $67.8 million in 2002. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased by 3.8 percentage points, to 55.9% in 2003 from 59.7% in 2002. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the related increase in income before income taxes were due primarily to efficiencies realized with the increase in revenues generated from the increase in mortgage loans originated and the increase in revenues earned per loan. Capital Resources and Liquidity We fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities. As we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our operations, we focus on maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios. At September 30, 2004, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was 38.9%, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from 40.0% at September 30, 2003. Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable (net of cash) divided by total capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash 23 Table of Contents plus stockholders equity). Our stockholders equity to total assets ratio increased 2.5 percentage points, to 44.1% at September 30, 2004, from 41.6% at September 30, 2003. We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs (including debt maturities) through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows from operating activities, our existing credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets. Homebuilding Capital Resources Cash At September 30, 2004, our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to $480.1 million. Bank Credit Facility In March 2004, we restructured and amended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing it to $1.0 billion and extending its maturity to March 25, 2008. The new facility included a $350 million letter of credit sub facility and an uncommitted $250 million accordion feature that permitted an increase in the facility. In June 2004, we exercised the accordion feature and obtained commitments from our lenders that increased the total size of the facility to $1.21 billion. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. We had no outstanding cash borrowings on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30, 2004 and 2003. Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility, $1.1 billion at September 30, 2004, or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory. At September 30, 2004, the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to $2.2 billion. At September 30, 2004, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility. Shelf Registration Statements At September 30, 2004, we had the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to $1.75 billion under our universal shelf registration statement. After the October 2004 issuance of $250 million of 4 7/8% Senior notes due 2010, our remaining capacity to issue new debt or equity securities was $1.5 billion. Also, at September 30, 2004, we had the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business acquisitions. Financial Services Capital Resources Cash At September 30, 2004, we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of $37.9 million. Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility In April 2004, our wholly owned mortgage company restructured and amended its mortgage warehouse loan facility, increasing the facility to $300 million and extending its maturity to April 8, 2005. This loan facility was amended on September 28, 2004 for a 30 day period, temporarily increasing the facility to $350 million to provide for increased year end closing volume. At September 30, 2004, we had borrowings of $267.7 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility. Commercial Paper Conduit Facility Our wholly owned mortgage company also has a $300 million commercial paper conduit facility (the CP conduit facility), which expires on June 29, 2006. The terms of the facility are renewable annually by the sponsoring banks. At September 30, 2004, $225.0 million had been drawn under the CP conduit facility. 24 Table of Contents The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. Borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale. The mortgage loans pledged to secure the CP conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multi seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At September 30, 2004, our total mortgage loans held for sale were $623.3 million. All mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility, the CP conduit facility or internally generated funds. Both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance. Operating Cash Flow Activities During the year ended September 30, 2004, we used $422.5 million of cash in our operating activities, as compared to $423.3 million of cash provided by operations during the prior year, resulting in net cash provided from operating activities of $0.8 million for the two years ended September 30, 2004. Both the net cash used in operations in fiscal 2004 and the net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 were the result of cash provided from net income and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by cash used to increase inventories, mortgage loans held for sale and other assets, reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial services operations. The variance in operating cash flows from 2003 to 2004 is a direct result of our decision to invest $1.4 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal 2004 versus a $0.5 billion cash investment in inventory growth in fiscal 2003. A large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years. Since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our inventory growth goals and our market opportunities, we believe that cash flows from operating activities before inventory additions is currently a better indicator of our liquidity. Investing Cash Flow Activities In fiscal 2004 and 2003, cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year. Financing Cash Flow Activities The majority of our short term financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and funds available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long term financing needs are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. In January 2004, we issued $200 million of 5% senior notes due 2009. On June 15, 2004, we used the majority of the proceeds of the issue to repay at maturity the $150 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 8 3/8% senior notes. In July 2004, we issued $200 million of 6 1/8% senior notes due 2014. In September 2004, we issued $250 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due 2014. We used the proceeds from both of these offerings to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In October 2004, we issued $250 million of 4 7/8% senior notes due 2010. We used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including land acquisition and development, home construction and homebuilding operations and other working capital needs. During fiscal 2004, our Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.047 per common share (split adjusted), and three quarterly cash dividends of $0.08 per common share, the last of which was paid on August 20, 2004 to stockholders of record on August 6, 2004. On October 14, 2004, 25 Table of Contents our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.08 per common share, which was paid on November 2, 2004, to stockholders of record on October 26, 2004. Changes in Capital Structure On December 1, 2003, our Board of Directors declared a three for two common stock split (effected as a 50% stock dividend), which was paid on January 12, 2004 to stockholders of record on December 22, 2003. On July 31, 2003, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock and up to $200 million of our outstanding debt securities, as market conditions warrant. As of September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had $175.6 million remaining of the Board of Directors authorization for repurchases of common stock and $200 million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by issuing senior notes. Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2004 are presented below: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Homebuilding: Notes Payable $ 247.3 $ 21.9 $ 1,038.8 $ 1,695.5 $ 3,003.5 Operating Leases 18.5 30.0 16.8 19.8 85.1 Purchase Obligations 84.0 39.5 4.6 128.1 Totals $ 349.8 $ 91.4 $ 1,060.2 $ 1,715.3 $ 3,216.7 Financial Services: Notes Payable $ 492.7 $ $ $ $ 492.7 Operating Leases 3.1 5.4 1.4 0.1 10.0 Totals $ 495.8 $ 5.4 $ 1.4 $ 0.1 $ 502.7 At September 30, 2004, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $133.8 million and surety bonds of $1,367.7 million, issued by third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third party guarantees. To meet the financing needs of our customers, our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are 26 Table of Contents committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. We manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS) and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments. As of September 30, 2004, our IRLCs totaled $562.8 million, and we had approximately $117.0 million outstanding of FMBS and $432.6 million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments related to our IRLCs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. At September 30, 2004, we had $251.4 million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of $4.9 billion, of which only $128.1 million is subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. Pursuant to FIN 46, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of $153.7 million. Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory At September 30, 2004, we controlled approximately 268,000 lots, 59% of which were lots under option or similar contracts. The following is a summary of our land/lot position at September 30: As of September 30, 2004 2003 Finished lots owned 24,000 22,000 Lots under development owned 86,000 67,000 Total lots owned 110,000 89,000 Lots controlled under lot option and similar contracts 158,000 90,000 Total land/lots controlled 268,000 179,000 Percentage controlled under option 59% 50% The percentage of our lots controlled under option contracts increased during 2004 as our operating divisions used our position as a large, national homebuilder to negotiate favorable land acquisition terms that utilize our capital efficiently and mitigate our land ownership risks. At September 30, 2004, we had a total of approximately 24,000 homes under construction, including approximately 1,600 model homes and less than 200 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months. At September 30, 2003, we had a total of approximately 21,000 homes under construction, including approximately 1,450 model homes and less than 300 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months. Inflation We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations. 27 Table of Contents Safe Harbor Statement and Risks Certain statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us. Other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us. General Economic, Real Estate and Other Conditions The homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, such as employment levels, housing demand, availability of financing for homebuyers, interest rates, consumer confidence and the effects of terrorist acts or threats or responses to them. Any oversupply of alternatives to new homes, such as rental properties and used homes, could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes. Homebuilders are also subject to inventory risks related to anticipating consumer demand and supply and risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding, the availability and cost of materials and labor and adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. As a result, in the future, potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes, or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them. In addition, some home buyers may cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether. Increases in Interest Rates or Decreases in Mortgage Availability Virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing. Any future increases in interest rates, decreases in the availability of mortgage financing, or curtailment of the liquidity provided to the mortgage markets by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing. This could adversely affect sales of our homes by making our homes less affordable. Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters We are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction, including zoning, density and building standards. Such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. This can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding. New housing developments can also be subject to assessments for public improvements and property taxes, which can be substantial. Laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays, increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas. All of these factors can cause increases in the prices of our homes and adversely affect sales of our homes. Competitive Conditions The homebuilding industry is very competitive. In each of the markets we serve, we compete with other homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable properties, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices, the need for increased selling incentives, lower sales or profit margins or delays in construction. Warranty and Product Liability Claims We are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business. As a consequence, we maintain product liability insurance, obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty reserves for the homes 28 Table of Contents we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built. Because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage, our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future. Contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce, we may be responsible for applicable self insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits. Additionally, the coverage offered by and availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly. We have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self insured retentions and claim reserves. There can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. Substantial Debt We have a significant amount of debt. The amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other requirements. It could require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for other purposes. It could also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions. Availability of Capital Our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain capital. Important sources of capital have included the sale of equity or debt and additional bank borrowings. Increases in interest rates, changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies, concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy, changing lending objectives of financial institutions, or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives. Moreover, the indentures for many of our outstanding notes contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future. Growth Strategies Since 1993, we have acquired many homebuilding companies. Although we are currently focusing on internal growth, we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future. Successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available. Although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past, we can give no assurance that, when we resume our acquisition activity, we will be able to successfully identify, acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future. Moreover, we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K should be consulted. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. 29 Table of Contents Our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133 when it was adopted on October 1, 2000. We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps, and such changes must be reflected in our income statements. Our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services. Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. Forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS) are used to protect uncommitted IRLCs against the risk of changes in interest rates. FMBS related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. FMBS related to funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges, with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the years ended September 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2004, total FMBS to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $144.0 million. Uncommitted IRLCs totaled approximately $130.1 million, the duration of which was less than six months and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately $27.6 million. At September 30, 2004, the fair value of the FMBS and IRLCs was an insignificant amount. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2004, for our debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value. In addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value of our interest rate swaps.

Horton, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
