ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Critical Accounting Policies General A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected. Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts, under the requirements of Interpretation No. 46 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Segment Information We report our consolidated financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Our homebuilding operating regions are our operating segments under SFAS No. 131 and have been aggregated into a single homebuilding reportable segment. Our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in 25 states and 74 markets throughout the United States. Our other operating and reporting segment is our financial services segment. The financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets. We have no foreign subsidiaries or operations. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66, the gross profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed. Virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing. We include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances. We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers. We recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. Origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses, respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans are sold. We sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors. 20 Table of Contents Some of the loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions. Based on historical experience, we estimate and record an allowance for losses related to loans sold with recourse. In the past, such losses have not been significant. Inventories and Cost of Sales We state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 144. In addition to the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, inventory costs include interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of construction superintendents, sales personnel and division and region management, advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. We use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project. When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each months accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued. Although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future could differ from our current accruals, our method has historically been consistently accurate. Each quarter, we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable. If our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the SFAS No. 144 guidelines, we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter. To date, such impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate. Fair value estimation under SFAS No. 144 involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities as amended (FIN 46). FIN 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities, which FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion. Certain of these deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the requirements of FIN 46. As such, certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option. In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the 21 Table of Contents variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated. Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to FIN 46, we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. Warranty Costs We have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods. The one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten year period is for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. Insurance Claim Costs We have, and require the majority of our subcontractors to have, general liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for our subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors. We self insure a portion of our overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us, naming some subcontractors as additional insureds. We record expenses and liabilities for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported. Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the claim rate or the average cost per claim used to estimate the self insured accruals would not result in a material change in our accrual. Goodwill We adopted SFAS No. 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Under its provisions, we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings. Such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption Goodwill. SFAS No. 142 requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded. We have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists. We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill assessment procedures required by SFAS No. 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates. 22 Table of Contents Income Taxes We calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 1). The American Jobs Creation Act, which was signed into law in October 2004, provides a tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities. When fully phased in, the deduction will be up to 9% of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income. Based on the guidance provided by FSP 109 1, this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109 and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return. The tax benefit resulting from the new deduction will be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006. We are evaluating the impact of this law on our future financial statements, and we currently estimate the future reduction in our federal income tax rate to be in the range of 0.50% to 0.75%. Stock based Compensation With the approval of our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period. We account for options under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, recognize no compensation expense for the grants. SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123. The SFAS No. 123 requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement, which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements. The statement is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2006. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), and we have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2005 Overview We generated significant increases in revenues and earnings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, driven primarily by the continued growth of our homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in homebuilding profit margins. The demand from first time and move up homebuyers in the United States was favorable during fiscal 2005, as national new home sales remained at a historically high level. Additionally, low mortgage rates continued to be a positive influence on housing demand during fiscal 2005. However, we believe that the primary drivers of housing demand were local in nature, related to the strength of market specific economic factors such as local job growth, unemployment rates and income growth. Additionally, we believe that the supply of new homes was significantly affected by local factors, such as government approval processes and the availability of land and lots suitable for residential construction. In a number of markets, increasingly difficult and lengthy governmental approval processes have limited the supply of new housing, which has contributed to new home price appreciation. Due to 23 Table of Contents such local factors, housing demand and supply has varied significantly among markets, which has created differing competitive dynamics for homebuilders in each individual market. Due in part to these factors, the overall U.S. homebuilding industry remains highly fragmented. However, the industry consolidation that began in the early 1990s continued in 2005. In 2005, we continued to execute our strategy of generating consistent, profitable growth through gaining market share, increasing capital allocated to strong homebuilding markets and capitalizing on our national, regional and local scale to improve our material, labor and capital cost structures. Key financial highlights for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2005 were as follows: Homebuilding Operations: Homebuilding revenues increased by 28% in fiscal 2005 and the value of net sales orders grew by 28%. Homebuilding operating margins increased by 250 basis points during fiscal 2005 due to improvements in homebuilding gross margins and control of overhead costs. Homebuilding pre tax income increased 51% in fiscal 2005, reflecting a 42% increase in homebuilding gross profit, while overhead costs increased only 28%. Our sales order backlog at September 30, 2005 was $5.8 billion, a fiscal year end record and 28% higher than our backlog at September 30, 2004. Net homebuilding debt to total capital, which is calculated as homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity), was 32.2% at September 30, 2005, an improvement of 670 basis points from the prior year, and an all time low for the Company. Financial Services Operations: Total financial services revenues increased 29% in fiscal 2005, driven by the growth in our homebuilding business and an increase in the percentage of our homes closed that were served by DHI Mortgage compared to fiscal 2004. Financial services pre tax income increased by 41% in fiscal 2005, due to increased revenue from loan production and title closings, leveraging our financial services overhead costs and controlling our operating costs. Consolidated Results: Net income increased 51% in fiscal 2005, due to the significant growth in consolidated revenues and improvements in homebuilding and financial services operating margins. Diluted earnings per share increased 50% in fiscal 2005. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 38.2%, as compared to 38.4% in fiscal 2004 and 37.9% in fiscal 2003. The increases in our effective income tax rates in 2005 and 2004 as compared with 2003 were due primarily to increases in pre tax income in states with higher state income tax rates. Our operating strategy for fiscal 2006 is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitability through capturing greater market share, while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet. We plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entering satellite markets as opportunities are available. However, we will continue to evaluate homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arise. To the extent that additional capital is available in excess of amounts we choose to invest in our homebuilding operations, we will consider directing such capital toward alternative uses, including stock 24 Table of Contents repurchases, as market conditions or other circumstances may warrant, within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures. Results of Operations Homebuilding Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by geographic region as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004: Net Sales Orders Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Homes Sold Value (In millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2005 2004 Change 2005 2004 Change 2005 2004 Change Mid Atlantic 5,072 4,032 26 % $ 1,342.7 $ 1,009.7 33 % $ 264,700 $ 250,400 6 % Midwest 3,093 2,261 37 % 821.5 634.5 29 % 265,600 280,600 (5 )% Southeast 8,181 6,301 30 % 2,036.3 1,375.8 48 % 248,900 218,300 14 % Southwest 21,375 18,146 18 % 4,227.8 3,086.7 37 % 197,800 170,100 16 % West 15,511 14,523 7 % 6,215.1 5,299.5 17 % 400,700 364,900 10 % 53,232 45,263 18 % $ 14,643.4 $ 11,406.2 28 % $ 275,100 $ 252,000 9 % Sales Order Backlog As of September 30, Homes in Backlog Value (In millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2005 2004 Change 2005 2004 Change 2005 2004 Change Mid Atlantic 2,516 1,740 45 % $ 747.7 $ 492.2 52 % $ 297,200 $ 282,900 5 % Midwest 1,361 861 58 % 402.2 269.7 49 % 295,500 313,200 (6 )% Southeast 3,136 2,987 5 % 908.4 698.6 30 % 289,700 233,900 24 % Southwest 7,273 6,632 10 % 1,665.0 1,195.3 39 % 228,900 180,200 27 % West 4,958 4,964 % 2,111.9 1,912.7 10 % 426,000 385,300 11 % 19,244 17,184 12 % $ 5,835.2 $ 4,568.5 28 % $ 303,200 $ 265,900 14 % Homes Closed Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Homes Closed Value (In millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2005 2004 Change 2005 2004 Change 2005 2004 Change Mid Atlantic 4,296 3,894 10 % $ 1,087.1 $ 888.4 22 % $ 253,000 $ 228,100 11 % Midwest 2,593 2,381 9 % 688.9 643.7 7 % 265,700 270,300 (2 )% Southeast 8,032 5,137 56 % 1,826.5 1,041.3 75 % 227,400 202,700 12 % Southwest 20,734 18,190 14 % 3,758.1 3,012.3 25 % 181,300 165,600 9 % West 15,517 13,965 11 % 6,016.0 4,905.4 23 % 387,700 351,300 10 % 51,172 43,567 17 % $ 13,376.6 $ 10,491.1 28 % $ 261,400 $ 240,800 9 % 25 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operating Margin Analysis Percentages of Homebuilding Revenues Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 Gross profit Home sales 25.4 % 22.8 % Gross profit Land/lot sales 35.5 % 38.5 % Gross profit Total homebuilding 25.6 % 23.1 % Selling, general and administrative expense 9.0 % 9.0 % Interest and other (income) expense (0.1 )% (0.1 )% Income before income taxes 16.7 % 14.2 % Net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers, net of sales contract cancellations. The value of net sales orders increased 28%, to $14,643.4 million (53,232 homes) in 2005 from $11,406.2 million (45,263 homes) in 2004. The overall cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2005 and 2004 were 19% and 17%, respectively. The average price of a net sales order in 2005 was $275,100, up 9% from the $252,000 average in 2004. The number and value of net sales orders increased in all five of our market regions, reflecting the successful execution of our organic growth strategies and the overall strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2005. All regions produced double digit percentage increases in the value of net sales orders during fiscal 2005, led by a 48% increase in the Southeast region resulting from our continued expansion of our presence in our Florida markets where housing demand is high. The average price of net sales orders increased in all of our regions except the Midwest, where the average sales price was down 5% due to our efforts to offer more lower priced products in the Chicago market. While we continue to increase prices in the markets where demand for our homes is strongest, we remain focused on ensuring that our core product offerings and prices in most of our markets remain affordable for our core customers, typically first time and move up homebuyers. Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Some of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval, which can result in cancellations. In the past, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters, although some contracts in backlog will not result in closings. Historically, our backlog conversion rates (closings during the quarter divided by beginning of the quarter backlog), have generally been in the range between 50% and 75%, with the highest quarterly conversion rate of each fiscal year typically occurring in the fourth quarter. At September 30, 2005, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes), up 28% from $4,568.5 million (17,184 homes) at September 30, 2004. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $303,200 at September 30, 2005, up 14% from the $265,900 average at September 30, 2004. The value of our sales order backlog increased in all five of our market regions, led by increases of 52% in our Mid Atlantic region, where we have significantly increased our capital investment, and 49% in our Midwest region, where sales in our Chicago market were especially strong in 2005. The average selling price of homes in backlog increased in four of our five market regions, with the largest increases occurring in our Southeast and Southwest regions, where generally strong demand for our homes allowed us to increase prices. The average sales price in the Midwest was down 6% due to the strong market acceptance of recently introduced, more affordably priced products in the Chicago market. Revenues from home sales increased 28%, to $13,376.6 million (51,172 homes closed) in 2005 from $10,491.1 million (43,567 homes closed) in 2004. Revenues from home sales increased by more than 20% and the number of homes closed increased by 10% or more in four of our five market regions. These results reflect the successful execution of our growth strategies, continued strength in demand for new 26 Table of Contents homes and our homebuilding divisions ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers. The average selling price of homes we closed during 2005 was $261,400, up 9% from $240,800 in 2004. The average selling price of homes closed increased by 9% or more in four of our five market regions. The average selling price of homes closed in our Midwest region decreased by 2% due to our offerings of more affordable products in the Chicago market. Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by a $92.2 million deferral of gross profit at September 30, 2005, in accordance with SFAS 66. Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 42%, to $3,488.3 million in 2005 from $2,460.7 million in 2004. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 250 basis points, to 25.6% in 2005 from 23.1% in 2004. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 260 basis points, to 25.4% in 2005 from 22.8% in 2004. This gross profit improvement is attributable to our ability to increase home prices in many of our markets; our ongoing efforts to control and reduce construction costs through our local, regional and national purchasing efforts; our ongoing re allocation of capital to our more profitable markets and a decrease in the capitalized interest amortized to cost of sales attributable to our homebuilding leverage ratio improvement and our debt refinancing efforts over the past two years. SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 28%, to $1,226.6 million in 2005 from $959.0 million in 2004. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 9.0% in both years. Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 17%, to $277.3 million in 2005 from $236.7 million in 2004, while our average daily homebuilding debt increased 26% in 2005 from 2004. The percentage increase in our average homebuilding debt was higher than the percentage increase in our interest incurred due to the March 2004 restructuring of our unsecured revolving credit facility which resulted in lower borrowing costs throughout 2005, and due to our efforts over the past two fiscal years to replace some of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates. We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both fiscal years, our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts, premiums and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. Interest amortized to cost of sales decreased by 10%, to $225.0 million in 2005 from $249.0 million in 2004. This reduction in interest amortized to total cost of sales is a direct result of the reductions in our homebuilding leverage and our debt refinancing efforts over the last two years. Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $15.7 million in 2005, compared to $9.9 million in 2004. The major component of other income in both 2005 and 2004 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $9.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively. Also included in other income in 2005 and 2004 was interest income of $3.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2003 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by geographic region as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003: Net Sales Orders Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Homes Sold Value (In millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change Mid Atlantic 4,032 3,594 12 % $ 1,009.7 $ 780.8 29 % $ 250,400 $ 217,300 15 % Midwest 2,261 2,067 9 % 634.5 553.6 15 % 280,600 267,800 5 % Southeast 6,301 4,528 39 % 1,375.8 863.3 59 % 218,300 190,700 14 % Southwest 18,146 15,699 16 % 3,086.7 2,614.7 18 % 170,100 166,600 2 % West 14,523 12,837 13 % 5,299.5 4,349.9 22 % 364,900 338,900 8 % 45,263 38,725 17 % $ 11,406.2 $ 9,162.3 24 % $ 252,000 $ 236,600 7 % Sales Order Backlog As of September 30, Homes in Backlog Value (In millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change Mid Atlantic 1,740 1,602 9 % $ 492.2 $ 370.9 33 % $ 282,900 $ 231,500 22 % Midwest 861 981 (12 )% 269.7 278.9 (3 )% 313,200 284,300 10 % Southeast 2,987 1,823 64 % 698.6 364.1 92 % 233,900 199,700 17 % Southwest 6,632 6,676 (1 )% 1,195.3 1,120.9 7 % 180,200 167,900 7 % West 4,964 4,406 13 % 1,912.7 1,518.6 26 % 385,300 344,700 12 % 17,184 15,488 11 % $ 4,568.5 $ 3,653.4 25 % $ 265,900 $ 235,900 13 % Homes Closed Fiscal Years Ended September 30, Homes Closed Value (In millions) Average Selling Price % % % 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change 2004 2003 Change Mid Atlantic 3,894 3,245 20 % $ 888.4 $ 674.8 32 % $ 228,100 $ 208,000 10 % Midwest 2,381 2,002 19 % 643.7 513.2 25 % 270,300 256,300 5 % Southeast 5,137 4,374 17 % 1,041.3 773.9 35 % 202,700 176,900 15 % Southwest 18,190 14,209 28 % 3,012.3 2,381.5 26 % 165,600 167,600 (1 )% West 13,965 12,104 15 % 4,905.4 3,990.7 23 % 351,300 329,700 7 % 43,567 35,934 21 % $ 10,491.1 $ 8,334.1 26 % $ 240,800 $ 231,900 4 % 28 Table of Contents Homebuilding Operating Margin Analysis Percentages of Homebuilding Revenues Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2004 2003 Gross profit Home sales 22.8 % 20.6 % Gross profit Land/lot sales 38.5 % 15.3 % Gross profit Total homebuilding 23.1 % 20.4 % Selling, general and administrative expense 9.0 % 9.6 % Interest and other (income) expense (0.1 )% 0.2 % Income before income taxes 14.2 % 10.7 % The value of net sales orders increased 24%, to $11,406.2 million (45,263 homes) in 2004 from $9,162.3 million (38,725 homes) in 2003. The overall cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2004 and 2003 were 17% and 18%, respectively. The average price of a net sales order in 2004 was $252,000, up 7% from the $236,600 average in 2003. The number of homes sold, value and the average price of net sales orders increased in each of our market regions during 2004 due to the successful execution of our growth strategies and generally strong demand for our homes in all of our market regions. The largest increases in the value of net sales orders occurred in the Southeast and Mid Atlantic regions, which was the result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our Florida, Virginia and Maryland markets. The increase in our average selling price reflected our ability to increase prices in the markets where demand for our homes was strongest in 2004, while we continued our efforts to ensure that our product offerings and prices in most of our markets remain affordable for our target customers, typically first time and move up homebuyers. At September 30, 2004, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $4,568.5 million (17,184 homes), up 25% from $3,653.4 million (15,488 homes) at September 30, 2003. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $265,900 at September 30, 2004, up 13% from the $235,900 average at September 30, 2003. The value of our sales order backlog increased in four of our five market regions, led by a 92% increase in the Southeast region, which was a result of our efforts to significantly increase our presence in our Florida markets. The average selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market regions, reflecting the generally strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2004 which allowed us to increase prices. Revenues from home sales increased 26%, to $10,491.1 million (43,567 homes closed) in 2004 from $8,334.1 million (35,934 homes closed) in 2003. Revenues from home sales increased by more than 20% in all of our five market regions, and the number of homes closed increased by 15% or more in all market regions, reflecting the successful execution of our growth strategies and our homebuilding divisions ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers. The average selling price of homes we closed during 2004 was $240,800, up 4% from $231,900 in 2003. The average selling price of homes closed increased in four of our five market regions, with the largest increases occurring in the Southeast and Mid Atlantic regions. Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 41%, to $2,460.7 million in 2004 from $1,746.3 million in 2003. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 270 basis points, to 23.1% in 2004 from 20.4% in 2003. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 220 basis points, to 22.8% in 2004 from 20.6% in 2003, which was attributable to our ability to increase home prices due to strong demand for our homes in many of our markets in 2004 and our ongoing efforts to control and reduce construction costs as we achieve greater economies of scale. SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by 17%, to $959.0 million in 2004 from $817.0 million in 2003. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses decreased 60 basis points, to 9.0% in 2004 from 9.6% in 2003. The improvement in SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues was 29 Table of Contents attributable to our ongoing cost control efforts and our ability to generate higher revenue levels that better leveraged our existing fixed SG&A expenses in 2004. Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 1%, to $236.7 million in 2004 from $239.5 million in 2003. Our average homebuilding debt increased 5% in 2004 from 2003; however, we replaced certain of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates, and we restructured and amended our unsecured revolving credit facility, which lowered our interest costs, resulting in this slight decrease in interest incurred in 2004. We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both years, our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. Interest amortized to cost of sales increased by 13% to $249.0 million in 2004 from $219.4 million in 2003. This increase was attributable to a 20% increase in total cost of sales, partially offset by the effects of the decline in interest incurred. Other income associated with homebuilding activities was $9.9 million in 2004, compared to other expense of $9.4 million in 2003. The major component of other income in 2004 was an increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $8.1 million. The major component of other expense in 2003 was $11.8 million of minority interests in the income of our consolidated joint ventures. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations Financial Services Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising DHI Mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004: Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2005 2004 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

Total first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 23% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, which was greater than our 17% increase in the number of homes closed because the percentage of total home closings from our own homebuyers for which DHI Mortgage handled the financing (our mortgage capture rate) increased to 63% in 2005 from 61% in 2004. Home closings from our own homebuyers 31 Table of Contents constituted 93% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2005, compared to 92% in 2004, reflecting DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. Sales of loans to third party investors increased 28% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Revenues from the financial services segment increased 29%, to $235.1 million in 2005 from $182.8 million in 2004. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold, while the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold remained relatively constant. The majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 22%, to $147.6 million in 2005 from $121.0 million in 2004. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased by 340 basis points, to 62.8% in 2005 from 66.2% in 2004. The improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue was due primarily to the increase in revenues, which better leveraged our fixed costs in 2005 as compared to 2004, and was also due to the effective cost control efforts of our financial services operations. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2003 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003: Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2004 2003 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

The percentage of total home closings from our own homebuyers which had financing handled by DHI Mortgage (our mortgage capture rate) was 61% in both years. Home closings from our own homebuyers constituted 92% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2004, compared to 82% in 2003, reflecting a decrease in the number of refinance loans originated in 2004. Sales of loans to third party investors increased 5% in 2004 as compared to 2003. Revenues from the financial services segment increased 4%, to $182.8 million in 2004 from $176.0 million in 2003. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to an increase in the number of mortgage loan originations to customers of our homebuilding operations and sold to third party investors, offset by a decline in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold. The decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan was primarily due to a shift in the product mix of mortgage loans originated and sold from higher margin fixed rate loans to lower margin adjustable rate loans, and increased competition due to excess capacity in the mortgage industry, which reduced the margins on all mortgage loans in 2004. General and administrative expenses associated with financial services increased 23%, to $121.0 million in 2004 from $98.3 million in 2003. As a percentage of financial services revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 66.2% in 2004 from 55.9% in 2003. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenue and the related decrease in income before income taxes were due primarily to the decline in average mortgage revenues earned per loan and increased costs associated with strengthening our financial services infrastructure to support our growing homebuilding business and expanding our mortgage operations into California. Capital Resources and Liquidity We fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. As we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our operations, we have focused on maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios. At September 30, 2005, our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 32.2%, an improvement of 670 basis points from 38.9% at September 30, 2004. Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity). The improvement reflects a 35% increase in stockholders equity, while net homebuilding debt increased only 1%. Our operating target range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45%, so the 32.2% ratio at September 30, 2005 is well below our targeted operating leverage level. Future fiscal year end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2005 year end ratio. We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services business because the business is separately capitalized, its debt is 33 Table of Contents substantially collateralized and our financial services debt is not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities. We include cash because of its capital function. For comparison, at September 30, 2005 and 2004, our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital were 40.6% and 43.2%, respectively. We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs (including debt maturities) through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows from operations, our existing or renewed credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets. Homebuilding Capital Resources Cash At September 30, 2005, our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to $1,111.6 million. Bank Credit Facility We have a $1.21 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a $350 million letter of credit sub facility, that matures on March 25, 2008. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. We borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements, and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public debt securities. We had no outstanding cash borrowings on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30, 2005 and 2004. Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, when we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poors Corporation, our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility, $1.09 billion at September 30, 2005, or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory. At September 30, 2005, the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to $2.5 billion. Effective November 7, 2005, we now have the two required debt ratings, so the borrowing base limitation is not currently in effect. At September 30, 2005, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility. We are currently in negotiations to re finance our revolving credit facility, which we expect will extend the maturity date and increase the capacity of the facility, lower the interest rate spread we must pay on borrowings under the facility and slightly revise certain other terms, covenants, limitations and restrictions under the facility. We expect the new revolving credit facility to be completed and in effect by December 31, 2005. Shelf Registration Statements At September 30, 2005, we had the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to $3.0 billion under our universal shelf registration statement. Also, at September 30, 2005, we had the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business acquisitions. Debt Repayments On April 1, 2005, we repaid the $200 million principal amount of our 10.5% senior notes which became due on that date. On July 15, 2005, we redeemed the $235 million principal amount of our 9.375% senior notes due 2009 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $246 million, plus accrued interest. The notes were originally issued by Schuler Homes, Inc. and were assumed by us in our merger with Schuler in February 2002. Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately $4.4 million, representing the call premium net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes. 34 Table of Contents Financial Services Capital Resources Cash At September 30, 2005, we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of $38.2 million. Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility Our mortgage subsidiary renewed and amended its $300 million mortgage warehouse loan facility in April 2005, increasing the amount that may be borrowed under the uncommitted accordion provisions to $150 million and extending its maturity to April 7, 2006. Our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility, as adjusted by the accordion provisions or otherwise by agreement of the parties, or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the amount drawn on our mortgage warehouse loan facility may not exceed 98% of all eligible mortgage loans held for sale and made available to the lenders to secure any borrowings under the facility. Through amendment to the credit agreement in June 2005, we obtained additional commitments from our lenders through the accordion provisions that increased the total commitments under the facility to $450 million. To provide for fiscal year end closing volume, we obtained temporary commitment increases of $225 million through amendments to the credit agreement in September 2005, which resulted in a total capacity of $675 million at September 30, 2005. Through amendments to the credit agreement in October and November 2005, the commitments under the facility were adjusted to $450 million, effective from October 28, 2005 through January 15, 2006. On January 16, 2006, the total capacity will return to $300 million, subject to increase to $450 million should the accordion provisions be implemented again. At September 30, 2005, we had borrowings of $549.5 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility. Commercial Paper Conduit Facility Our mortgage subsidiary also has a $500 million commercial paper conduit facility (the CP conduit facility), that expires on June 29, 2006. Through amendment to the credit agreement in June 2005, we increased the capacity available under this facility from $300 million to $500 million. To provide for fiscal year end closing volume, we obtained a temporary increase of $200 million through amendments to the credit agreement in September 2005, which resulted in a total capacity of $700 million at September 30, 2005. The temporary increase was effective through October 14, 2005 when the capacity decreased to $600 million available through November 10, 2005. Beginning on November 11, 2005, the total capacity decreased to $500 million. The terms of the facility are renewable annually by the sponsoring banks. At September 30, 2005, $700 million was drawn under the CP conduit facility. In the past, we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. Although we do not anticipate any problems in renewing or extending these facilities or obtaining temporary additional commitments in the future, the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to do so. The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. Borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale. The mortgage loans assigned to secure the CP conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multi seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At September 30, 2005, our total mortgage loans held for sale were $1,358.7 million. All mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility, the CP conduit facility or internally generated funds. Our mortgage warehouse loan facility and our CP conduit facility contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiarys minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income. Our mortgage subsidiary is in compliance with each of these covenants. 35 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flow Activities During the year ended September 30, 2005, we used $620.7 million of cash in our operating activities, as compared to $422.5 million during the prior year. The net cash used in operations in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was the result of cash provided from net income and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by cash used to increase residential land, lot and home inventories, mortgage loans held for sale and other assets, reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial services operations. Among other factors, the variance in operating cash flows from fiscal 2004 to 2005 is a result of our decision to invest $1.9 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal 2005, versus a $1.4 billion cash investment in inventory growth in fiscal 2004. A large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years. Since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our future growth goals and our market opportunities, we believe that cash flows from operating activities before increases in residential land and lot inventories is currently a better indicator of our liquidity. Investing Cash Flow Activities In fiscal 2005 and 2004, cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases partially increase with our growth, but they are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year. Financing Cash Flow Activities The majority of our short term financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and funds available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long term financing needs are typically funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. In October 2004, we issued $250 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2010. We used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including land acquisition and development, home construction and homebuilding operations and other working capital needs. In December 2004, we issued $300 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2016. We used the proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In February 2005, we issued $300 million of 5.25% senior notes due 2015. We used the proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In July 2005, we issued $300 million of 5.375% senior notes due 2012. We used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility and for the early redemption of our 9.375% senior notes due 2009. During fiscal 2005, our Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share (split adjusted), one quarterly cash dividend of $0.0675 per common share (split adjusted), and two quarterly cash dividends of $0.09 per common share, the last of which was paid on August 19, 2005 to stockholders of record on August 5, 2005. On October 6, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per common share, which was paid on October 31, 2005, to stockholders of record on October 20, 2005. Changes in Capital Structure In December 2003, our Board of Directors declared a three for two stock split (effected as a 50% stock dividend), paid on January 12, 2004 to holders of record of our common stock as of December 22, 36 Table of Contents 2003. In February 2005, our Board of Directors declared a four for three stock split (effected as a 331/3% stock dividend), paid on March 16, 2005 to holders of record of our common stock as of March 1, 2005. In July 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock and outstanding debt securities, as market conditions warrant. In May 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $175.6 million of our common stock and up to $200 million of our outstanding debt securities, representing the amounts then remaining of the 2003 authorization. As of September 30, 2005, we had $175.6 million remaining of the Board of Directors authorization for repurchases of common stock and $200 million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities. On November 17, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock and up to $200 million of outstanding debt securities, replacing the existing common stock and debt securities repurchase authorization. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the capital markets. Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2005 are presented below: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Total (In millions) Homebuilding: Notes Payable $ 21.0 $ 218.3 $ 986.0 $ 2,444.8 $ 3,670.1 Operating Leases 22.0 35.3 21.0 15.2 93.5 Purchase Obligations 137.2 89.0 4.6 230.8 Totals $ 180.2 $ 342.6 $ 1,011.6 $ 2,460.0 $ 3,994.4 Financial Services: Notes Payable $ 1,249.5 $ $ $ $ 1,249.5 Operating Leases 3.3 4.2 0.7 8.2 Totals $ 1,252.8 $ 4.2 $ 0.7 $ $ 1,257.7 At September 30, 2005, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $137.2 million and surety bonds of $1.8 billion, issued by third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third party guarantees. To meet the financing needs of our customers, our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are 37 Table of Contents committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. We manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS) and the purchase of Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) on certain loan types. As of September 30, 2005, our IRLCs totaled $622.8 million, and we had approximately $143.3 million outstanding of FMBS and EDFC and $492.0 million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments related to our IRLCs. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. At September 30, 2005, we had $287.4 million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of $5.9 billion, of which only $230.8 million of the remaining purchase price is subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. Pursuant to FIN 46, we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of $200.4 million. Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory At September 30, 2005, we controlled approximately 346,000 lots, 55% of which were lots under option or similar contracts. The following is a summary of our land/lot position at September 30: As of September 30, 2005 2004 Lots owned developed and under development 156,000 110,000 Lots controlled under lot option and similar contracts 190,000 158,000 Total land/lots controlled 346,000 268,000 Percentage controlled under option 55% 59% The total number of homes under construction was approximately 25,000 and 24,000 at September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in homes under construction at the end of both years, were approximately 1,600 model homes and less than 200 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months. Seasonality We experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2005, 61% of our consolidated revenues and 63% of our consolidated operating income were attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. This seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. Because the cash generated from our homebuilding operations during these quarters is not available to our financial services segment, we have employed the uncommitted accordion provisions of the segments credit facilities and sought other temporary commitment increases for this purpose. Any additional temporary financing for our mortgage operations is typically reduced during the first and second quarters of the succeeding fiscal year as we sell our related mortgage portfolio. As a result, our results of operations and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year. 38 Table of Contents Inflation We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are based on managements beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. These forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate, believe, consider, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, objective, plan, projection, seek, strategy, target or other words of similar meaning. Any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience, and the expectations derived from them may not be realized, due to unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forward looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to: changes in general economic, real estate and other conditions; changes in interest rates, the availability of mortgage financing or the effective cost of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters; our substantial debt; competitive conditions within our industry; the availability of capital; our ability to effect our growth strategies successfully; and the uncertainties inherent in warranty and product liability claims matters. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K should be consulted. Further discussion of these and other risk considerations is provided in Item 1A Risk Factors under Part I of this annual report on Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We generally do not have an obligation to prepay 39 Table of Contents fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. Our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133. We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps, and such changes must be reflected in our income statements. Our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services. Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. We manage interest rate risk related to uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS) and the purchase of Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) on certain loan types. FMBS and EDFC related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recorded in current earnings. FMBS and EDFC related to funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges, with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2005, FMBS and EDFC to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $253.0 million. Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which was less than six months, totaled approximately $130.8 million, and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately $88.4 million at September 30, 2005. At September 30, 2005, the fair value of the FMBS, EDFC and IRLCs was an insignificant amount. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2005, for our debt obligations, principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value. In addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value of our interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2005, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $3.2 million liability.

Horton, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of D.R. Horton, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 7, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
