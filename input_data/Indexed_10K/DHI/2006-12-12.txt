ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2006 Overview During fiscal 2006, the homebuilding industry experienced an industry wide softening of demand for new homes. In many markets, home price appreciation over the past several years had attracted real estate investors and speculators. As price appreciation slowed in fiscal 2006, the demand from investors and speculators for new homes also slowed, resulting in an increase in new homes available for sale. At the same time, existing homes offered for sale by investors and speculators increased. In response to higher inventories of both new and existing homes, homebuilders increased the use of sales incentives to continue to sell new homes. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, we experienced a decrease in our net sales orders due to a decrease in homebuyer consumer confidence and a related increase in sales contract cancellations, both of which we believe were caused by the continued increase in the level of sales incentives offered by both builders of new homes and sellers of existing homes. Our use of incentives also contributed to significantly lower gross margins on the homes we closed during those quarters. Although we believe the long term fundamentals which support home sales demand remain solid and the current negative conditions in many of our markets will moderate over time, we cannot predict the duration and severity of the current market conditions. During fiscal 2006, we adjusted our operating strategy to meet the new homebuilding business environment, and we expect to continue with these initiatives through fiscal 2007. These adjustments include: Decreasing our SG&A infrastructure to be in line with our reduced expectations of production levels. Decreasing our cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors. Reducing our land and lot inventory from current levels by significantly curtailing our spending for land and lot purchases and renegotiating or canceling land purchase contracts. Reducing our inventory of homes under construction from current levels by limiting the construction of unsold homes. Continuing to offer incentives to increase sales as necessary to maximize profits, returns and cash flows. We expect that these adjustments to our operating strategy will generate positive cash flows in fiscal 2007 and allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, providing us with flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they become available in the future. Because we cannot predict the duration or severity of the current market conditions, we cannot provide any assurances that the adjustments we have made in our operating strategy to address these conditions will be successful. Key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 were as follows: Homebuilding Operations: Homebuilding revenues increased by 8% in fiscal 2006. However, the value of net sales orders decreased by 5%, reflective of the more challenging market conditions recently encountered. Homebuilding operating margins as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased by 400 basis points during fiscal 2006, primarily due to lower homebuilding gross margins. Our sales order backlog at September 30, 2006 was $5.2 billion, 11% below our backlog at September 30, 2005. Net homebuilding debt to total capital, which is calculated as homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity), was 40.7% at September 30, 2006. 19 Financial Services Operations: Total financial services revenues increased 24% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to a 41% increase in the number of loans sold during the year compared to fiscal 2005. Financial services pre tax income increased by 3% in fiscal 2006, due to increased revenue from loan production and title closings, largely offset by the increase in financial services G&A costs. Consolidated Results: Net income decreased 16% in fiscal 2006, due to a 17% decrease in homebuilding operating margin. Diluted earnings per share decreased 16% in fiscal 2006. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 37.9%, as compared to 38.2% in fiscal 2005 and 38.4% in fiscal 2004. Although specific directives within our operating strategy may have changed or may be implemented at a slower pace, our long term operating strategy remains much the same. We intend to continue to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business profitability through capturing greater market share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We plan to continue investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process and entering satellite markets as opportunities are available. We will also continue to evaluate homebuilding acquisition opportunities as they arise. To the extent that additional capital is available in excess of amounts we choose to invest in our homebuilding operations or retain as liquidity, we will consider directing such capital toward alternative uses, including repayment of debt, dividend payments or stock repurchases, as market conditions or other circumstances may warrant, within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures. Results of Operations Homebuilding Our seven homebuilding operating regions are our operating segments. We present six reportable segments, as we aggregate two of the operating regions into one reporting segment. These reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states: Northeast: Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin Southeast: Alabama, Florida and Georgia South Central: Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas Southwest: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas (Lubbock only) and Utah California: California and Nevada (Reno only) West: Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington 20 Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting region as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. Based on our revised aggregation of operating segments, we have restated fiscal 2005 amounts between regions to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation.

The value of net sales orders decreased 5%, to $13,895.2 million (51,980 homes) in 2006 from $14,643.4 million (53,232 homes) in 2005. The number of net sales orders decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, reflecting the industry wide softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a reduction in investor purchases, an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and an increase in sales contract cancellation rates. Many prospective homebuyers are approaching the purchase decision more tentatively due to the increased uncertainty surrounding the housing market. These factors affected our business most significantly in our fourth fiscal quarter, when our net sales orders decreased 25% compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2005. Subsequent to fiscal year 2006, our net sales orders for the month ended October 31, 2006 decreased 20% compared to the month ended October 31, 2005. Our annual cancellation rate increased to 28% in fiscal 2006, and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and the month ended October 31, 2006 increased to approximately 40%, exceeding our typical historical range of 16% to 20%. The higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our Arizona, California and Florida markets. A significant portion of the increase in cancellations was due to our prospective homebuyers being unable to sell their existing homes. The largest percentage decreases in the number and value of net sales orders in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 occurred in our Northeast, Southeast and California regions. The decreases in sales in these regions are primarily attributable to the changes in market conditions described above. Partially offsetting the decreases in net sales orders was an 18% increase in net sales orders in our South Central region, where many of our markets did not experience the same slowdown in demand in fiscal 2006. The average price of a net sales order in fiscal 2006 was $267,300, a decrease of 3% from the $275,100 average in fiscal 2005. During the year, slight to moderate increases and decreases in average sales prices occurred among our regions, resulting in our relatively flat average price compared to 2005. In general, our ability to raise prices is dependent on the demand for our homes; therefore, the lack of any significant overall price appreciation during 2006 was due in large part to the recent decrease in demand and our increased use of sales incentives in many markets. Particularly, the home price appreciation that occurred in many of our California, Arizona and Florida markets during fiscal 2005 has since moderated and in many instances has reversed. We also continually monitor and may adjust our product and geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base, typically first time and move up homebuyers. This sometimes also contributes to a decrease in the average price. 23 Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval, which can result in cancellations. In the past, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters, although this relationship may change if our cancellation rates remain above normal levels or continue to increase. Historically, our backlog conversion rates (closings during the quarter divided by beginning of the quarter backlog), have generally been in the range of 50% to 75%, with the highest quarterly conversion rate of each fiscal year typically occurring in the fourth quarter. At September 30, 2006, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes), down 11% from $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes) at September 30, 2005. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $286,100 at September 30, 2006, down 6% from the $303,200 average at September 30, 2005. The value of our sales order backlog decreased in four of our six market regions, led by decreases of 31%, 30% and 26% in our Northeast, Southeast and California regions, respectively, which is reflective of the current difficult sales environment. The average selling price of homes in backlog at September 30, 2006 as compared to September 30, 2005 reflect only slight to moderate increases and decreases among our regions. Home Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Revenues from home sales increased 9%, to $14,545.4 million (53,099 homes closed) in 2006 from $13,376.6 million (51,172 homes closed) in 2005. Revenues from home sales increased in all six of our market regions, led by the Northeast and Southeast regions, with increases of 22% and 13%, respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during 2006 was $273,900, up 5% from $261,400 in 2005. The average selling price of homes closed increased by slight to moderate amounts in five of our six market regions, led by the Southwest and Southeast regions with increases of 12% and 11%, respectively. Many markets, especially some of the California, Arizona and Florida markets which experienced the most price appreciation in recent years, have experienced weakening demand in the latter part of fiscal 2006, resulting in declines in total and per home revenue. As reflected in our net sales order volume, demand has slowed in a number of our markets in recent quarters, and in general, we are offering more incentives and price concessions to obtain home sales. Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2006 were increased by $1.6 million, while revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by $92.2 million from changes in profit deferred pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our wholly owned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66. As of September 30, 2006, the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage loans held for sale was $90.6 million. Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 4%, to $3,342.2 million in 2006 from $3,488.3 million in 2005. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 300 basis points, to 22.6% in 2006 from 25.6% in 2005. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 150 basis points, to 24.0% in 2006 from 25.5% in 2005. The primary factors reducing our home sales gross profit margin were the difficult market conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in many of our markets and caused a decline of approximately 200 basis points in home sales gross margin. We have had to utilize additional incentives in many of our markets due to the current challenging sales environment. Sales incentives affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home, or by increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price. An additional 45 basis points of home sales gross margin decline was a result of the decrease in the relative number of closings in markets such as California and Nevada, which have had significant price appreciation in the last few years and, therefore, have had above average gross margins. These declines were partially offset by an improvement of approximately 55 basis points related to the increase in home sales revenues and gross profit from the recognition of profit previously deferred in accordance with SFAS No. 66. The remaining improvement of 40 basis points was primarily due to a reduction in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. 24 In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues, costs, and other factors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. Valuation adjustments on finished homes are recorded when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value is less than the fair value less costs to sell the home. During fiscal 2006, several communities under development that demonstrated potential impairment indicators, with a combined carrying value of $739.5 million at September 30, 2006, were evaluated for potential impairment. Our analyses of these projects generally assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared with current sales orders for the particular project or revenues realized from comparable projects. We determined that projects with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority of which were in California, were impaired. Consequently, we recorded impairment charges of $146.2 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. The remaining $280.2 million of such projects with impairment indicators are primarily in California. It is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value. Additionally, if conditions in the homebuilding industry worsen in the future, we may be required to evaluate additional projects for potential impairment which may result in additional impairment charges and such charges could be significant. We periodically write off earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we wrote off $124.7 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land purchase option contracts which we determined we would not pursue. The inventory impairment charges and write offs of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 180 basis points in fiscal 2006. Should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and if we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase contracts, we may have to write off additional earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs. We currently do not expect the potential for such write offs in fiscal 2007 to be as significant as the fiscal 2006 write offs. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by $230.0 million, or 19%, to $1,456.6 million in 2006 from $1,226.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses increased 90 basis points, to 9.9% in 2006 from 9.0% in 2005. The largest component of our homebuilding SG&A is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 64% and 67% of SG&A costs in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Those costs increased $115.1 million, or 14%, to $932.4 million in 2006 from $817.3 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth. The remaining increase in SG&A of $114.9 million was primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs, property taxes, rent expense and subdivision maintenance. These increases were due to the growth in our inventory levels and the competitive selling environment. Throughout fiscal 2005 and through the first half of fiscal 2006, we increased the infrastructure of our homebuilding operations to support the then planned delivery of approximately 58,000 homes in fiscal 2006 and further growth in home closings into fiscal 2007. However, due to recent sales trends, the increase in home closings of only 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to 17% in fiscal 2005 and an actual decline in home closings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to the same period of fiscal 2005, we no longer expect further growth in home closings in the near term. We are adjusting our SG&A infrastructure to support our 25 decreased expectations of future closing volumes; however, we cannot provide assurance that future SG&A expense levels as a percentage of homebuilding revenues will be as low as historical levels. Interest Expense We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both fiscal 2005 and 2006, our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized virtually all interest from homebuilding debt except for the call premium, unamortized discount/premium and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. Interest amortized to cost of sales was 2.1% of total cost of sales in 2006, compared to 2.2% in 2005. In fiscal 2006, in connection with the early redemption of our 9.375% senior notes due 2011 and our 10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded interest expense of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and issuance costs, net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded interest expense of approximately $4.4 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, in connection with the early redemption of our 9.375% senior notes due 2009, we recorded interest expense of approximately $4.4 million for the call premium and unamortized issuance costs, net of the unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes. Excluding interest charges related to early retirement of debt and the replacement of our revolving credit facility, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 19%, to $325.4 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $272.9 million in fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from an increase in our average homebuilding debt of 34% in 2006 compared to 2005. Interest incurred increased at a slower rate than our debt primarily because our debt has been more heavily weighted to our revolving credit facility in 2006. The revolving credit facility carries a lower interest rate than the weighted average interest rate of our senior and senior subordinated notes. Our ongoing efforts to replace our older, higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates also contributed to the improvement in relative interest costs. Other Income Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $11.0 million in 2006, compared to $15.7 million in 2005. The major component of other income in both 2006 and 2005 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $3.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively. Also included in other income in 2006 and 2005 was interest income of $6.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Goodwill At September 30, 2006, we had $578.9 million in goodwill, which we evaluate for impairment annually or when circumstances warrant an earlier review. We have allocated our goodwill to our reporting regions as follows, as of September 30, 2006 and 2005: Northeast $74.4 million, Southeast $11.5 million, South Central $15.9 million, Southwest $102.4 million, California $300.3 million and West $74.4 million. Although no impairment existed as of September 30, 2006, if market conditions continue to deteriorate in our reporting regions, our impairment review may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future. Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region Northeast Region Homebuilding revenues increased 22% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a 16% increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years; however, as a percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 220 basis points to 9.0%, from 11.2% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage (home sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs), with the gross margin declines in our Virginia and Coastal Carolina markets having the greatest impact on the overall decrease. Additionally, profitability was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs of $38.5 million in fiscal 2006 versus $1.3 million in fiscal 2005. 26 Southeast Region Homebuilding revenues increased 12% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an 11% increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the number of homes closed. Income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years; however, as a percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 250 basis points to 17.0%, from 19.5% in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the regions gross profit percentage, which was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs of $34.4 million in fiscal 2006 versus $3.8 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding these charges, we experienced similar core home sales gross profit margins in both fiscal years; however, we did experience a sharp decline in these margins during the second half of fiscal 2006, reflecting the softening market conditions, especially in Florida. South Central Region Homebuilding revenues increased 9% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 26% higher in 2006 compared to 2005, and as a percentage of the regions revenues, increased 100 basis points to 7.4%, from 6.4% in 2005. This increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in the regions selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues, as gross margin for the region was comparable from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Southwest Region Homebuilding revenues increased 10% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to a 12% increase in the average selling price of homes closed, while the number of homes closed decreased 3%. Income before income taxes for the region was 10% higher in 2006 compared to 2005, and as a percentage of the regions revenues was 15.2% in both years. Inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs of $25.7 million in fiscal 2006 versus $1.3 million in fiscal 2005 contributed to an 80 basis point decline in the regions gross margin. This decline was offset by a $22.8 million increase in gross margin resulting from changes in profit deferred pursuant to SFAS No. 66. While core homebuilding margins were relatively flat in the Denver and Phoenix markets for the full fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005, we did experience a sharp decline in the Phoenix market home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared with the earlier quarters. California Region Homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat, increasing only 1% in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting a slight increase in the number of homes closed and a slight decline in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 54% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the regions revenues, decreased 1,120 basis points to 9.5%, from 20.7% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the regions gross profit percentage, which was significantly affected by a decline of approximately 600 basis points in the regions core home sales gross margins with the largest declines in the Sacramento and San Diego markets. In addition, the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs of $165.8 million in fiscal 2006 versus $9.2 in fiscal 2005 had a significant negative impact on gross margins. West Region Homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat, increasing only 2% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to slight increases in both the number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 13% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the regions revenues, decreased 390 basis points to 22.9%, from 26.8% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the regions gross profit percentage, primarily attributable to lower gross margins in the Las Vegas market. 27 Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2004 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting region as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. Based on our revised aggregation of operating segments, we have restated fiscal 2005 and 2004 amounts between regions to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation.

The overall cancellation rates of the value of new sales contracts in 2005 and 2004 were 19% and 17%, respectively. The average price of a net sales order in 2005 was $275,100, up 9% from the $252,000 average in 2004. The number and value of net sales orders increased in all six of our market regions, reflecting the execution of our organic growth strategies and the overall strong demand for our homes in fiscal 2005. All regions produced double digit percentage increases in the value of net sales orders during fiscal 2005, led by our Southeast and Southwest regions, with increases of 46% and 40%, respectively. The increase in our Southeast region resulted from the continued expansion of our presence in our Florida markets where housing demand was high. The increase in our Southwest region was primarily due to increases in homes sold and average sales price in our Arizona and New Mexico markets. The average price of net sales orders increased at varying levels across all of our regions, reflecting our ability to increase prices in markets where demand for our homes was strongest. The highest percentage increases in average sales prices occurred in our Southwest, Southeast and California regions, while lesser increases were experienced in our West, South Central and Northeast regions. In the Northeast region where demand was still strong, our efforts to offer more lower priced products, particularly in the Chicago market, resulted in an increase of only 1% in the average sales price. At September 30, 2005, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes), up 28% from $4,568.5 million (17,184 homes) at September 30, 2004. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $303,200 at September 30, 2005, up 14% from the $265,900 average at September 30, 2004. The value of our sales order backlog increased in four of our six market regions, led by increases of 50% in both our Northeast and Southwest regions. The average selling price of homes in backlog increased in all of our market regions, with the largest percentage increases occurring in our Southeast and Southwest regions, where generally strong demand for our homes allowed us to increase prices. Home Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Revenues from home sales increased 28%, to $13,376.6 million (51,172 homes closed) in 2005 from $10,491.1 million (43,567 homes closed) in 2004. Revenues from home sales increased by 20% or more in four of our six market regions and the number of homes closed increased by more than 10% in five of our six market regions. These results reflect the execution of our growth strategies, continued strength in demand for new homes and our homebuilding divisions ability to efficiently deliver homes in backlog to homebuyers. The average selling price of homes closed during 2005 was $261,400, up 9% from $240,800 in 2004. The average selling price of homes closed increased by more than 10% in four of our six market regions. 30 Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by a $92.2 million deferral of profit at September 30, 2005, pursuant to SFAS No. 66. Total homebuilding gross profit increased by 42%, to $3,488.3 million in 2005 from $2,460.7 million in 2004. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 250 basis points, to 25.6% in 2005 from 23.1% in 2004. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues increased 250 basis points, to 25.5% in 2005 from 23.0% in 2004. Of the 250 basis point improvement in home sales gross profit percentage, approximately 170 basis points was due to market conditions that led to strong demand for our homes. Those conditions allowed us to raise the selling prices of our homes more rapidly than the overall increases in the construction costs of our homes in the majority of our markets. Our largest selling price and gross profit increases were obtained in our Florida and Arizona markets. An additional 70 basis points of the improvement in home sales gross profit percentage was due to a decrease in the capitalized interest amortized to cost of sales as a percentage of home sales revenues, which was attributable to our homebuilding leverage ratio improvement and our debt refinancing efforts over the past two years. The remaining home sales gross profit percentage improvement related primarily to the relative increase in closings in our more profitable markets due to our efforts to re allocate capital to these markets. Selling, General and Administrative Expense SG&A expenses from homebuilding activities increased by $267.6 million, or 28%, to $1,226.6 million in 2005 from $959.0 million in 2004. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A expenses were 9.0% in both years. The largest component of our homebuilding SG&A is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 67% and 65% of SG&A costs in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Those costs increased $192.4 million, or 31%, to $817.3 million in 2005 from $624.9 million in 2004, largely due to the addition of employees to support our growth. The remaining increase in SG&A of $75.2 million was primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs, rent expense, subdivision maintenance and model home furniture depreciation. Interest Expense Interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 17%, to $277.3 million in 2005 from $236.7 million in 2004, while our average daily homebuilding debt increased 26% in 2005 from 2004. The percentage increase in our average homebuilding debt was higher than the percentage increase in our interest incurred due to the March 2004 restructuring of our unsecured revolving credit facility which resulted in lower borrowing costs throughout 2005, and due to our efforts over the past two fiscal years to replace some of our higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates. We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both fiscal years, our inventory under construction or development exceeded our interest bearing debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt except for the unamortized discounts, premiums and fees related to debt we paid off prior to maturity. Interest amortized to cost of sales decreased by 10%, to $225.0 million in 2005 from $249.0 million in 2004. This reduction in interest amortized to total cost of sales is a direct result of the reductions in our homebuilding leverage and our debt refinancing efforts over the last two years. Other Income Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $15.7 million in 2005, compared to $9.9 million in 2004. The major component of other income in both 2005 and 2004 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $9.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively. Also included in other income in 2005 and 2004 was interest income of $3.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 31 Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region Northeast Region Homebuilding revenues increased 19% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 29% higher in 2005 compared to 2004, and as a percentage of the regions revenues, increased 90 basis points to 11.2%, from 10.3% in 2004. This increase was due to an increase in the regions home sales gross profit percentage, with the gross margin improvements in our Virginia and Coastal Carolina markets having the greatest impact on the overall increase. Southeast Region Homebuilding revenues increased 71% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a 54% increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a 12% increase in the average selling price of those homes, reflecting an increase in housing demand and our increased investments in the region, particularly in Florida. Income before income taxes for the region was 135% higher in 2005 compared to 2004, and as a percentage of the regions revenues, increased 530 basis points to 19.5%, from 14.2% in 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the regions home sales gross profit percentage, particularly in our Florida markets, where the high demand for homes enabled us to both aggressively increase prices and close more homes. South Central Region Homebuilding revenues increased 16% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a 14% increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 16% higher in 2005 compared to 2004; however, as a percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 10 basis points to 6.4%, from 6.5% in 2004. The increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to the increase in the number of homes closed, while the slight decrease in income before taxes as a percentage of the regions revenues was the result of home sales gross profit percentages decreasing slightly in 2005 compared to 2004. Southwest Region Homebuilding revenues increased 25% in 2005 compared to 2004, due to an 11% increase in the number of homes closed and a 13% increase in the average selling price of those homes, reflecting an increase in housing demand, particularly in Arizona. Income before income taxes for the region was 98% higher in 2005 compared to 2004, and as a percentage of the regions revenues, increased 560 basis points to 15.2%, from 9.6% in 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the regions home sales gross profit percentage, particularly in our Arizona and New Mexico markets, where the high demand for homes enabled us to more aggressively increase prices. California Region Homebuilding revenues increased 19% in 2005 compared to 2004, due to a 9% increase in the number of homes closed and an 11% increase in the average selling price of those homes, reflecting continued strong housing demand in California in 2005. Income before income taxes for the region was 17% higher in 2005 compared to 2004; however, as a percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 30 basis points to 20.7%, from 21.0% in 2004 largely due to an increase in SG&A as a percentage of the regions revenues. West Region Homebuilding revenues increased 49% in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to a 25% increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a 13% increase in the average selling price of those homes, reflecting the strong housing demand throughout the region in 2005 and our increased investments in the region, particularly in Nevada. Income before income taxes for the region was 77% higher in 2005 compared to 2004 and as a percentage of the regions revenues, increased 430 basis points to 26.8%, from 22.5% in 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in the regions home sales gross profit percentage, particularly in our Hawaii and Oregon markets, where we experienced significant price appreciation during fiscal 2005. 32 Results of Operations Financial Services Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising DHI Mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005: Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2006 2005 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

Total first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers increased 11% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in loans originated or brokered was greater than our 4% increase in the number of homes closed because our mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers financing) increased to 68% in 2006 from 63% in 2005. Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 94% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2006, compared to 33 93% in 2005, reflecting DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. The number of loans sold to third party investors increased 41% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated, as well as the implementation of more efficient loan sale processes during fiscal 2006. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2006 includes the effect of the sales of an unusually high volume of mortgage loans held at September 30, 2005. Revenues from the financial services segment increased 24%, to $290.8 million in 2006 from $235.1 million in 2005. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold. The decline in revenue per loan was largely due to less favorable selling conditions for mortgage originations and the interest rate environment in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. General and administrative (G&A) expenses associated with financial services increased 37%, to $202.2 million in 2006 from $147.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expenses increased by 670 basis points, to 69.5% in 2006 from 62.8% in 2005. The largest component of our financial services G&A expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 77% and 76% of G&A costs in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Those costs increased 39%, to $155.4 million in 2006 from $111.6 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth. The increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenues reflects the growth of our financial services infrastructure at a faster rate than the growth in revenues. Because we now do not expect our year over year growth in home closings and the related mortgage loan originations to continue, we have adjusted, and will continue to adjust, our financial services G&A infrastructure to support our expected closings volume. Significant fluctuations in financial services general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned. In addition, our financial services operations are generally staffed at levels sufficient to support our anticipated seasonal higher mortgage loan volume periods, which may vary significantly between periods.

Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 93% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2005, compared to 92% in 2004, reflecting DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. Sales of loans to third party investors increased 28% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Revenues from the financial services segment increased 29%, to $235.1 million in 2005 from $182.8 million in 2004. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold, while the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold remained relatively constant. The majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. G&A expenses associated with financial services increased 22%, to $147.6 million in 2005 from $121.0 million in 2004. As a percentage of financial services revenues, G&A expenses decreased by 340 basis points, to 62.8% in 2005 from 66.2% in 2004. The largest component of our financial services G&A expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 76% and 73% of G&A costs in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Those costs increased 26%, to $111.6 million in 2005 from $88.8 million in 2004, largely due to the addition of employees to support our growth. The improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of financial services revenues was due primarily to the more efficient use of our personnel to support the increase in mortgage loan volume. Significant fluctuations in financial services general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned. 35 Overview of Current Capital Resources and Liquidity We fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. As we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations, we have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. At September 30, 2006, our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 40.7%, an increase of 850 basis points from 32.2% at September 30, 2005. Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity). Homebuilding notes payable does not include the balance of liabilities, if any, associated with consolidated land inventory not owned. The increase in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at September 30, 2006 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was due to the decrease in cash and the increase in borrowings associated with funding our increase in inventory, partially offset by the increase in retained earnings. Our target operating range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45%, so the 40.7% ratio at September 30, 2006 is in line with our operating target. We remain focused on maintaining our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet so we can be flexible in reacting to market conditions; however, future fiscal year end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2006 year end ratio. We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services business because the business is separately capitalized and its debt is substantially collateralized by specified mortgage loans held for sale, and its debt is not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities. Because of its capital function, we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital. For comparison, at September 30, 2006 and 2005, our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital, without netting cash balances, were 43.1% and 40.6%, respectively. We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs (including debt maturities) through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows from operations, our existing or renewed credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public capital markets. Homebuilding Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents At September 30, 2006, our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to $457.8 million. Bank Credit Facility During November 2006, we increased the size of our $2.15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a $1.0 billion letter of credit sub facility, to $2.5 billion and extended its maturity by one year to December 16, 2011. The revolving credit facility has an uncommitted $400 million accordion provision which could be used to increase the facility to $2.9 billion. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. We borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements, and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public debt securities. We had $800.0 million in cash borrowings outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30, 2006 and no outstanding borrowings on the facility at September 30, 2005. Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, when we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poors Corporation, our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility, $1.23 billion at September 30, 2006, or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory. Beginning November 7, 2005, we had the two required investment grade debt ratings, so the 36 borrowing base limitation is not currently in effect. On April 5, 2006, we received the investment grade rating from the third rating agency. Our revolving credit facility also imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including limits on investments, cash dividends, stock repurchases and incurrence of indebtedness, and required maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum ratio of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and extraordinary gains and losses to interest incurred and minimum levels of tangible net worth. At September 30, 2006, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of our bank revolving credit facility and our public debt obligations. Repayments of Public Unsecured Debt On March 15, 2006, we redeemed our 9.375% senior notes due 2011 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $209.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately $10.6 million, representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. On July 15, 2006, we redeemed our 10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011. The notes, which were originally issued by Schuler Homes, Inc. and were assumed in the merger in February 2002, were redeemed at an aggregate price of approximately $152.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately $2.8 million, representing the call premium, net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes. Recently Issued Public Unsecured Debt In April 2006, we issued $500 million of 6.5% senior notes due 2016 and $250 million of 6.0% senior notes due 2011. We used the proceeds from these offerings for the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Shelf Registration Statements On June 13, 2006, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. Also, at September 30, 2006, we had the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business acquisitions. Financial Services Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents At September 30, 2006, we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of $129.8 million. Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility Our wholly owned mortgage company has a mortgage warehouse loan facility. Upon its maturity in April 2006, the loan agreement was amended and restated to extend its maturity date to April 6, 2007. This amendment also changed the total capacity of the mortgage warehouse loan facility from $600 million to $670 million until May 1, 2006 and then to $540 million thereafter, subject to increases upon consent of the lenders to $750 million under the accordion provision of the credit agreement. Through exercise of the accordion provision in September 2006, the total capacity of the mortgage warehouse loan facility was increased to $750 million from September 22, 2006 to November 6, 2006 and then to $540 million thereafter. At September 30, 2006, we had borrowings of $371.7 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility. Our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the amount drawn on our mortgage warehouse facility may not exceed 98% of all eligible mortgage loans held for sale and made available to the lenders to secure any borrowings under the facility. Commercial Paper Conduit Facility Our wholly owned mortgage company also has a commercial paper conduit facility (the CP conduit facility). Upon its maturity in June 2006, the loan agreement was amended and restated, increasing the total capacity of the CP conduit facility from $650 million to $1.2 billion. The new agreement expires June 27, 2009, subject to the annual renewal of the 364 day backup liquidity feature. At September 30, 2006, we had borrowings of $820.0 million outstanding under the CP conduit facility. 37 In the past, we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. Although we do not anticipate any problems in renewing or extending these facilities or obtaining temporary additional commitments in the future, the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to do so. The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility are not guaranteed by either D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. Borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale. Additionally, at September 30, 2006, borrowings under the CP conduit facility were secured by restricted cash arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale as collateral. The mortgage loans assigned to secure the CP conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multi seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At September 30, 2006, our total mortgage loans held for sale were $1,022.9 million. All mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility, the CP conduit facility or internally generated funds. Both of our financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiarys minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income. At September 30, 2006, our mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of these covenants. Operating Cash Flow Activities During the year ended September 30, 2006, we used $1.2 billion of cash in our operating activities, as compared to $620.7 million of cash used in such activities during the prior year. The net cash used in operations during fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of cash provided from net income and a decrease in mortgage loans held for sale, offset by cash used to increase residential land and lot and home inventories. The net cash used in operations during fiscal 2005 was the result of cash provided from net income and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities, offset by cash used to increase residential land, lot and home inventories, mortgage loans held for sale and other assets. The principal reason for the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 was our decision to invest $3.1 billion of cash to fund inventory growth in the period as compared to a $1.9 billion cash investment for inventory growth in fiscal 2005. The decision to fund additional inventory growth was based on managements expectations for future returns from the incremental inventory investments. In light of the more challenging market conditions encountered in the last six months of fiscal 2006, our expectations have changed, so we have substantially slowed our planned purchases of land and lots to reduce our inventory to better match our new reduced rate of production. Our ability to reduce our inventory levels in the near term is, however, partially dependent upon our ability to close a sufficient number of homes in the next few quarters. To the extent our inventory levels decrease during fiscal 2007, we expect net positive cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2007, assuming all other factors remain constant. A large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years. Since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our inventory growth goals and our market opportunities, we believe that cash flows from operating activities before increases in residential land and lot inventories is currently a better indicator of our cash flows from operations. Another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal 2006 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of $335.8 million during fiscal 2006. The decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, as a result of more efficient loan sale processes put in place during fiscal 2006. We expect to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow. However, in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior periods or if our mortgage capture rate declines, the amount of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate positive cash flows from the reduction in the balance of mortgage loans held for sale. 38 Investing Cash Flow Activities In fiscal 2006 and 2005, cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year. Financing Cash Flow Activities The majority of our short term financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long term financing needs are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. In March 2006, we redeemed our 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $209.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately $10.6 million, representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. In April 2006, we issued $500 million principal amount of 6.5% senior notes due 2016 and $250 million principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2011. We used the proceeds from these offerings for the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In July 2006, we redeemed our 10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011. The notes, which were originally issued by Schuler Homes, Inc. and were assumed in the merger in February 2002, were redeemed at an aggregate price of approximately $152.4 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded interest expense of approximately $2.8 million, representing the call premium, net of the unamortized premium related to the redeemed notes. Borrowings by our mortgage subsidiary under the CP conduit facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans as collateral. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the balances of cash restricted for this purpose were $248.3 million and $0, respectively. During fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per common share, two quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per common share, and one quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, the last of which was paid on September 1, 2006 to stockholders of record on August 21, 2006. On October 12, 2006, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, which was paid on November 1, 2006, to stockholders of record on October 23, 2006. Changes in Capital Structure In December 2003, our Board of Directors declared a three for two stock split (effected as a 50% stock dividend), paid on January 12, 2004 to holders of record of our common stock as of December 22, 2003. In February 2005, our Board of Directors declared a four for three stock split (effected as a 331/3% stock dividend), paid on March 16, 2005 to holders of record of our common stock as of March 1, 2005. In November 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of our common stock and up to $200 million of outstanding debt securities, replacing the previous common stock and debt securities repurchase authorizations. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased one million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $36.8 million, all of which occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2005. As of September 30, 2006, we had $463.2 million remaining of the Board of Directors authorization for repurchases of common stock and $200 million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities. In November 2006, our Board of Directors renewed the remaining $463.2 million common stock repurchase authorization and increased the debt repurchase authorization to $500 million. Additionally, both authorizations were extended to November 30, 2007. 39 On January 26, 2006, our shareholders approved an amendment to the D.R. Horton, Inc. charter which increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to one billion shares. We continue to evaluate our alternatives for future non operating uses of our available capital, including repayment of debt, dividend payments and common stock repurchases, based on market conditions and other circumstances, and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets and the restrictions gin our bank agreements and indentures. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the debt capital markets. Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2006 are presented below: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Homebuilding: Notes Payable (1) $ 6,612.5 $ 341.7 $ 1,380.5 $ 2,077.8 $ 2,812.5 Operating Leases 107.9 30.4 44.0 22.4 11.1 Purchase Obligations 54.8 34.0 18.3 2.5 Totals $ 6,775.2 $ 406.1 $ 1,442.8 $ 2,102.7 $ 2,823.6 Financial Services: Notes Payable (2) $ 1,237.4 $ 1,237.4 $ $ $ Operating Leases 11.8 4.0 5.6 2.2 Totals $ 1,249.2 $ 1,241.4 $ 5.6 $ 2.2 $ (1) Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our senior notes and senior subordinated notes, our revolving credit facility and our secured notes. The principal amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to be $800 million through its maturity, and the related interest obligation is based on the effective rate of 6.1% as of September 30, 2006. (2) Financial services notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiarys warehouse loan facility and commercial paper conduit facility. The interest obligations associated with these variable rate facilities are based on their effective rates of 6.1% and 5.6%, respectively, and principal balances outstanding at September 30, 2006. At September 30, 2006, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $128.2 million and surety bonds of $2.3 billion, issued by third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third party guarantees. To meet the financing needs of our customers, our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. 40 We manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS) and the purchase of Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) on certain loan types. As of September 30, 2006, our IRLCs totaled $647.7 million, and we had approximately $391.6 million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments and $429.5 million outstanding of FMBS and EDFC related to our uncommitted IRLCs. In an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing, we began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects us from future increases in interest rates related to potential mortgage originations of approximately $599 million. To accomplish this, we purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic interest rate hedges in the form of FMBS and put options on both EDFC and mortgage backed securities (MBS). At September 30, 2006, the notional amount of the FRAs was $354 million, while economic interest rate hedges totaled $2.4 billion in EDFC put options and $104 million in MBS put options, hedging a notional principal of $245.0 million in mortgage loan commitments. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months. These instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended September 30, 2006 were not significant. Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory The following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at September 30, 2006 and 2005: As of September 30, 2006 2005 Lots Lots Controlled Controlled Lots Owned Under Lot Total Lots Owned Under Lot Total Developed Option and Land/Lots Homes Developed Option and Land/Lots Homes and Under Similar Owned and in and Under Similar Owned and in Development Contracts Controlled Inventory Development Contracts Controlled Inventory Northeast 22,000 31,000 53,000 4,200 20,000 44,000 64,000 3,000 Southeast 32,000 33,000 65,000 5,200 25,000 38,000 63,000 4,000 South Central 34,000 36,000 70,000 7,400 28,000 38,000 66,000 6,000 Southwest 52,000 12,000 64,000 5,800 52,000 28,000 80,000 4,400 California 19,000 15,000 34,000 3,900 17,000 23,000 40,000 3,900 West 31,000 6,000 37,000 2,000 14,000 19,000 33,000 1,900 190,000 133,000 323,000 28,500 156,000 190,000 346,000 23,200 59% 41% 100% 45% 55% 100% In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. At September 30, 2006, we owned or controlled approximately 323,000 lots, 41% of which were lots under option or similar contracts, compared with approximately 346,000 lots at September 30, 2005. At September 30, 2006, we controlled approximately 133,000 lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately $4.0 billion under land and lot option purchase contracts, with a total of $211.3 million in deposits. Our lots controlled include approximately 23,500 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately $875 million for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not yet been terminated. We have written off $30.5 million of deposits and $10.3 million of pre acquisition costs relating to these 23,500 lots under contract, resulting in a net deposit balance of $180.8 million at September 30, 2006. During fiscal 2006, including the write offs described above, we wrote off a total of $124.7 million of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land and lot 41 purchase option contracts for which we do not intend to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots. Write offs of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were $17.1 million and $20.1 million, respectively. Within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at September 30, 2006, there were a limited number of contracts, representing only $54.8 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations. Pursuant to the provisions of Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 as amended (FIN 46), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of $100.4 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts. At September 30, 2006, we had a total of approximately 28,500 homes in inventory, including approximately 1,900 model homes and approximately 440 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months. At September 30, 2005, we had a total of approximately 23,200 homes in inventory, including approximately 1,600 model homes and approximately 200 unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months. Of our total homes in inventory, 50% and 41% were unsold at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Seasonality We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. In prior years, we generally had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result, our results of operations and financial position at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year. In fiscal 2006, 57% of our consolidated revenues was attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to softening homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2006, only 46% of our consolidated operating income was attributable to operations in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. This decrease was primarily due to the increased use of incentives to sell homes and inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs recorded during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006. We expect that we will experience our historical seasonal patterns of revenues and operating income in future fiscal years. Inflation We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and, to date, inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. However, during periods of softer homebuilding market conditions, we may not be able to offset the increases in our costs with higher selling prices.

Any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience, and the expectations derived from them may not be realized, due to unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forward looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to: changes in general economic, real estate construction and other business conditions; changes in interest rates, the availability of mortgage financing or the effective cost of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters; our substantial debt; competitive conditions within our industry; the availability of capital; our ability to effect our growth strategies successfully; and the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K should be consulted. Further discussion of these and other risk considerations is provided in Item 1A Risk Factors under Part I of this annual report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies General A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected. Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. We have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts, under the requirements of FIN 46. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed. We include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits 43 received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances. We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers. We recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. Origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses, respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans are sold. We sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors. Some of the loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions. Based on historical experience, we estimate and record an allowance for losses related to loans sold with recourse. Inventories and Cost of Sales Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of construction superintendents, sales personnel and division and region management, advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SG&A expense as incurred. Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. Home construction costs are accumulated for each specific home. We use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project. When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each months accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, historically, differences in amounts have not been significant. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues, costs, and other factors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, valuation adjustments are recorded on finished homes when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value is less than the fair value less costs to sell the home. 44 Consolidated Land Inventory Not Owned We account for our land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46. FIN 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities, which FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. In the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion. Under the requirements of FIN 46, certain of the option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option. In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated. Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to FIN 46, we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. Warranty Costs We have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods. The one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten year period is for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. Insurance Claim Costs We have, and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have, general liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors. We self insure a portion of our overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us, naming some subcontractors as additional insureds. We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported. Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties 45 such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the claim rate or the average cost per claim used to estimate the self insured accruals would not result in a material change in our accrual. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired. Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we review goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant an earlier review. Impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill existed. We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. The goodwill assessment procedures required by SFAS No. 142 require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates. Continued softness in the homebuilding industry may result in the determination that some of our goodwill has become impaired, which would result in a potentially significant charge to reflect goodwill impairment. Income Taxes We calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Stock based Compensation With the approval of our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period. On October 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Prior to October 1, 2005, we accounted for stock option grants using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants since all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157; however, it is 46 not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, which addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in current year financial statements. The SAB requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 108; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FIN 48; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140, which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like (offset) accounting by allowing a company the option to carry mortgage servicing rights at fair value. This new Statement amends SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125, with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities. SFAS No. 156 is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances. Since we do not retain the servicing rights when we sell our mortgage loans held for sale, the adoption of SFAS No. 156 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3. This statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle, and requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for us for accounting changes and corrections of errors made after October 1, 2006, the beginning of our fiscal year 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. 47 Our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps, and such changes must be reflected in our income statements. Our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services. Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. We manage interest rate risk related to uncommitted IRLCs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS) and the purchase of Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) on certain loan types. FMBS and EDFC related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. FMBS and EDFC related to funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges, with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2006, FMBS and EDFC to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $1,007.5 million. Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which are generally less than six months, totaled approximately $256.1 million, and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately $368.5 million at September 30, 2006. The fair value of the FMBS, EDFC and IRLCs at September 30, 2006 was an insignificant amount. In an effort to stimulate home sales by potentially offering homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing, we began a program during fiscal 2006 which protects us from future increases in interest rates related to potential mortgage originations of approximately $599 million. To accomplish this, we purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic interest rate hedges in the form of FMBS and put options on both EDFC and mortgage backed securities (MBS). At September 30, 2006, the notional amount of the FRAs was $354 million, while economic interest rate hedges totaled $2.4 billion in EDFC put options and $104 million in MBS put options, hedging a notional principal of $245 million in mortgage loan commitments. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months. These instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended September 30, 2006 were not significant. The following table sets forth principal cash flows by expected maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2006. In addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps. Because the mortgage warehouse credit facility and CP conduit facility are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days, the outstanding balances at September 30, 2006 are included in the variable rate maturities for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2007. At September 30, 2006, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million liability.

Horton, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries at September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note H, the Company has restated its segment disclosures. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of D.R. Horton, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 6, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Fort Worth, Texas December 6, 2006 50
