ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2007 Overview Our fiscal 2007 results reflect the challenges that the homebuilding industry faced during the year. Fiscal 2006 marked the beginning of the current housing downturn, and in fiscal 2007 the factors hurting demand for new homes persisted, grew in intensity and became more pervasive across the United States. Throughout the year, the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging. High inventory levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted through the year. The effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest rates on certain loan products, due to credit tightening in the mortgage markets. These factors, combined with our continued elevated sales cancellation rate, caused our sales volume to be significantly below expectations. Also, our gross profit from home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to stimulate demand in our communities. As we progressed though fiscal 2007, our disappointing sales results, further declines in our sales order prices, continued declines in our gross profit from home sales revenues and the more challenging market conditions caused us to have a more cautious outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business. We believe that housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and may deteriorate further, and that the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear. Our outlook incorporates several factors, including continued margin pressure from increased price reductions and sales incentives; continued high levels of new and existing homes available for sale; weak demand from new home consumers as they continue to see home prices adjust downward; continued high sales cancellations; continued weak housing affordability in many markets that experienced rapid price appreciation over the past few years; and permanent restrictions on the availability of certain mortgage products as a result of the recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets. Due to the declining market conditions and our increased use of price reductions and sales incentives, we evaluated a significant portion of our inventory in our quarterly impairment analyses during fiscal 2007. Additionally, we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill. Our goodwill and inventory impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increasing challenges in the homebuilding industry, and our belief that these challenging conditions may last longer and have a greater impact on our business than we previously believed. Based on our evaluations, we recorded significant impairment charges to our inventory and goodwill balances during the year, which resulted in a net loss for fiscal 2007. Strategy We believe the long term fundamentals which support housing demand, namely population growth and household formation, remain solid. We also believe the current negative market conditions, the effects of which have been more severe and more prolonged than previously expected, will moderate over the long term. In the interim, we remain committed to the following initiatives related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business environment: Reducing our land and lot inventory from current levels by constructing and selling homes, opportunistically selling land and lots, significantly restricting our spending for land and lot purchases, decreasing our land development spending or in some instances, suspending development in certain projects until market conditions improve; and renegotiating or canceling land option purchase contracts. Reducing our inventory of homes under construction by limiting the construction of unsold homes. Continuing to offer incentives and price reductions to increase sales as necessary to maximize returns and cash flows. 21 Table of Contents Decreasing our cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors. Continuing to modify our product offerings to provide more affordable homes. Decreasing our SGA infrastructure to be in line with our reduced expectations of production levels. Reducing our level of debt by utilizing cash flows from operations. These initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows from operations during fiscal 2007, which we utilized to reduce our outstanding debt by a substantial amount. Although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will continue to be successful, we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity position. Key Results Key financial results as of and for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, were as follows: Homebuilding Operations: Homebuilding pre tax income, before pre tax charges for goodwill impairment, inventory impairments and write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land option contracts, was $783.6 million, down 64% from $2,149.6 million in fiscal 2006. Homebuilding revenues decreased 25% to $11.1 billion. Homes closed decreased 22% to 41,370 homes and the average selling price of those homes decreased 5% to $259,200. Net sales orders decreased 35% to 33,687 homes. Sales order backlog decreased 48% to $2.7 billion. Home sales gross margins before inventory impairments, land option cost write offs and the effect of the change in profit deferred under SFAS No. 66 decreased 720 basis points to 16.8%. Homebuilding SGA expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues increased 40 basis points to 10.3%. Homebuilding debt decreased by $897.9 million to $3,989.0 million. Net homebuilding debt to total capital improved 50 basis points to 40.2%, and gross homebuilding debt to total capital improved 140 basis points to 41.7%. Financial Services Operations: Total financial services revenues decreased by 29% to $207.7 million. Financial services pre tax income decreased by 37% to $68.8 million. Financial services debt decreased by $803.9 million to $387.8 million. Consolidated Results: Net loss per share was $2.27, compared to diluted earnings per share of $3.90. Net loss was $712.5 million, compared to net income of $1,233.3 million. Stockholders equity decreased to $5.6 billion at September 30, 2007, from $6.5 billion at September 30, 2006. Net cash provided by operations was $1.4 billion during fiscal 2007. 22 Table of Contents Results of Operations Homebuilding Our operating segments are our seven homebuilding operating regions, which we present as separate reportable segments. Previously, we presented six homebuilding reporting segments, aggregating both our Northeast and Midwest operating regions into our Northeast reporting segment. However, because of a realignment of our management structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, our Colorado markets are now included in our Midwest operating region, rather than in our Southwest operating region. As a result, we determined that each of our seven operating regions constitutes a reportable segment, as reflected in our current year presentation. All prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation. These reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states: Northeast: Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia Midwest: Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin Southeast: Alabama, Florida and Georgia South Central: Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas Southwest: Arizona, New Mexico and Utah California: California and Nevada (Reno only) West: Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. Based on our revised disaggregation of operating segments and the states within those segments, we have restated the 2006 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the 2007 presentation.

The value of net sales orders decreased 41%, to $8,230.6 million (33,687 homes) in 2007 from $13,895.2 million (51,980 homes) in 2006. The value of net sales orders decreased 48%, to $1,309.5 million (6,374 homes) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 from $2,532.2 million (10,430 homes) in the same period of fiscal 2006. The decreases in our net sales orders reflect the softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a reduction in investor purchases, a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence. Additionally, we believe that the rapid price appreciation of new and existing homes in many markets over the past several years has reduced the number of potential homebuyers able to afford a home. Many prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase decision more tentatively due to continued increases in price concessions and sales incentives offered on both new and existing homes, concern over their ability to sell an existing home or obtain mortgage financing and the general uncertainty surrounding the housing market. We have attempted to increase sales by providing increased sales incentives and lowering prices, but the factors above, combined with the continued pricing responses of our competitors, have limited the impact of our pricing efforts. Subsequent to fiscal year 2007, the volume of our net sales orders for the month ended October 31, 2007 decreased 54% compared to the month ended October 31, 2006. In comparing fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all seven of our market regions. These decreases were primarily due to similar decreases in the number of homes sold in each region, although in our Southeast, Southwest and California regions, a decline in average selling prices was also a significant factor. The decreases in average selling prices were primarily due to the increased use of price concessions and sales incentives and, to a lesser extent, a shift to more affordable products in those regions. The most significant decline in net sales orders in fiscal 2007 occurred in our California region, with 48% fewer homes sold than in fiscal 2006. We believe that home sales in our California markets have been negatively impacted, to a greater extent than our other regions, by a reduction in the pool of qualified buyers due to a lack of housing affordability and the decline of mortgage availability. We are closely monitoring, on a project by project basis, our products, pricing and other operational strategies in the California region. We will further modify product offerings and pricing as necessary, as we attempt to improve our sales in this region. Our annual cancellation rate (sales orders cancelled divided by gross sales orders) was 38% in fiscal 2007, compared to 28% in fiscal 2006. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was 48% and 26 Table of Contents cancellations in the month ended October 31, 2007 were at a similar rate. The higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our Arizona, California and Florida markets. These elevated cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most homebuilding markets, including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes, the increasing level of sales incentives and home price reductions in our markets continuing to erode buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets. The impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late August and continued through September and October as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or they could not qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines. The average price of our net sales orders in fiscal 2007 was $244,300, a decrease of 9% from the $267,300 average in fiscal 2006. The average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our Southeast, Southwest and California regions, due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our Florida, Arizona and California markets. In general, our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes, and declines in our average selling prices during the year were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives. Further, as the inventory of existing homes for sale has continued to rise, it has led to the need to ensure our pricing is competitive with comparable existing home sales prices. We continually monitor and may adjust our product mix, geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base, typically first time and move up homebuyers. To a lesser extent than the competitive factors discussed above, this has also contributed to decreases in the average selling price. Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. Before the current housing downturn, our backlog has been a reliable indicator of the level of home closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters; however, due to our current elevated cancellation rates, higher level of unsold homes in inventory and difficult conditions in many of our markets, this relationship between backlog and future home closings may have changed. At September 30, 2007, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $2,694.4 million (10,442 homes), a decrease of 48% from $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes) at September 30, 2006. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $258,000 at September 30, 2007, down 10% from the $286,100 average at September 30, 2006. The value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly in all of our market regions, with the largest percentage decrease occurring in our California region. Home Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Revenues from home sales decreased 26%, to $10,721.2 million (41,370 homes closed) in 2007 from $14,545.4 million (53,099 homes closed) in 2006. Revenues from home sales decreased in all seven of our market regions, led by the Midwest and California regions, with decreases of 41% and 40%, respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during 2007 was $259,200, down 5% from $273,900 in 2006. The decrease in our fiscal 2007 home sales revenues was the result of slowing demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during the year. The number of homes closed in 2007 decreased 22% due to decreases in six of our seven market regions. As a result of the decline in net sales orders during the year and the decline in our sales order backlog, we expect to close fewer homes in fiscal 2008 than we did in fiscal 2007. As conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate, our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate. Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were increased by $58.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from changes in profit deferred pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our wholly owned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66. As of September 30, 27 Table of Contents 2007, the balance of deferred profit related to such mortgage loans held for sale was $32.6 million, compared to $90.6 million at September 30, 2006. The decline is attributable to both the drop in the number of homes closed and a decline in the availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the SFAS No. 66 profit deferral. Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 82%, to $603.7 million in 2007 from $3,342.2 million in 2006. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, as well as impairment charges and land option cost write offs, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 1,720 basis points, to 5.4% in 2007 from 22.6% in 2006. Approximately 1,020 basis points of the decrease was due to the effect of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, these were 12.0% in fiscal 2007 versus 1.8% in fiscal 2006. Gross profit from home sales decreased by 47%, to $1,848.9 million in 2007, from $3,497.6 million in 2006, and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased 680 basis points, to 17.2%. The primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets, causing a decline of approximately 650 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues. Due to the current sales environment in many of our markets, we have offered a variety of incentives and price concessions, which affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price. We are also offering greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of homes, which is at a higher than desired level. This strategy has helped reduce our total homes in inventory by approximately 8,600 units from September 30, 2006, but has also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit. Additionally, our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 60 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and 30 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in home sales gross margin of 20 basis points due primarily to an increase in the relative number of home closings in our more profitable markets, and 40 basis points resulting from the recognition of $58.0 million of previously deferred gross profit in accordance with SFAS No. 66 during 2007, compared to $1.6 million in 2006. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, land inventory and related development costs are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and timing of revenues and costs and other factors which, in turn, are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these homes. During fiscal 2007, the difficult conditions within the homebuilding industry became more challenging. High inventory levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year. The effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest rates on certain loan products, due to credit tightening in the mortgage markets. These factors, combined with our disappointing sales results, further declines in sales order prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales revenues throughout the year, caused our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business to become more cautious as the year progressed. Our current outlook is that we believe 28 Table of Contents housing market conditions will continue to be challenging and may deteriorate further, and that the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear. During fiscal 2007, our quarterly inventory impairment analyses performed in accordance with SFAS No. 144 utilized assumptions that incorporated our cautious outlook, which reflects the expectation that the challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry will persist and have a greater impact than we believed when the year began. Consequently, our strategy to reduce our inventory and lot position in a number of markets will likely take longer and require additional price concessions and incentives than previously anticipated. Therefore, our impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 indicated a significant number of projects with impairment indicators. Communities with a combined carrying value of $2,622.4 million as of September 30, 2007, had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment. The analysis of each of these projects generally assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each project or for comparable projects in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given project in the current market conditions, we estimated the remaining lives of these projects to range from six months to in excess of ten years. Through these evaluations, we determined that projects with a carrying value of $940.5 million as of September 30, 2007, the largest portions of which were in the California, West and Southeast regions, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded impairment charges totaling $278.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. These fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of $1,222.2 million during fiscal 2007. Approximately 74% of these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development, and approximately 26% of these charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes in inventory. During fiscal 2006, we recorded impairment charges totaling $146.2 million related to projects with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority of which were in California. Of the remaining $1,681.9 million of such projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at September 30, 2007, the largest concentrations are in California (28%), Florida (20%), and Arizona (16%). It is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these projects may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value. Additionally, if conditions in the homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen in the future beyond current expectations, and as we re evaluate specific project pricing and incentive strategies, we may be required to evaluate additional projects or re evaluate previously impaired projects for potential impairment. These evaluations may result in additional impairment charges, and such charges could be material. Based on a review of land and lot option contracts performed each quarter, we write off earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, we wrote off $107.3 million and $124.7 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land purchase option contracts. Should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase contracts, we may write off additional earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs. The inventory impairment charges and write offs of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 1,200 basis points in fiscal 2007, compared to 180 basis points in fiscal 2006. Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) Expense SGA expenses from homebuilding activities decreased by $315.1 million, or 22%, to $1,141.5 million in 2007 from $1,456.6 million in 2006. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SGA expenses increased 40 basis points, to 10.3% in 2007 from 9.9% in 2006, due to a decrease in revenues. The largest component of our homebuilding SGA is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 59% and 64% of SGA costs in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Those costs decreased $260.2 million, or 28%, to $672.2 million in 2007 from $932.4 million in 2006, largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of employees to 29 Table of Contents match our current and anticipated home closing levels, as well as a decrease in incentive compensation, which is primarily based on profitability. Our homebuilding operations employed approximately 5,100 and 7,100 employees at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining decrease in SGA of $54.9 million was primarily attributable to decreases in subdivision maintenance, advertising costs and professional consulting fees. We continue to adjust our SGA infrastructure to support our expected closings volume; however, we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current SGA expense as a percentage of revenues. If our volume of future home closings is lower than fiscal 2007 levels, our future SGA percentage may increase further. Interest Incurred We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both fiscal years, our inventory under construction or development exceeded our debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt. Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges, was 2.4% of total home and land/lot cost of sales in 2007, compared to 2.1% in 2006. Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2007 with fiscal 2006, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 6%, to $304.3 million, primarily due to a 5% decrease in our average homebuilding debt. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt In fiscal 2007, in connection with the early retirement of our 8.5% senior notes due 2012, we recorded a loss of approximately $12.1 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. In fiscal 2006, in connection with the early retirement of our 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our 10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded a loss of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees, net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded a loss of approximately $4.4 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006. Other Income Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $4.0 million in 2007, compared to $11.0 million in 2006. Major components of other income in both years were interest income and gain on the sale of assets, while in fiscal 2006, the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps was also a major component. Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we have restated our goodwill balances between reporting segments to reflect the revised aggregation of our operating regions that resulted from a realignment of our management structure during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Our Colorado markets, which were previously included in our Southwest operating region, are now included in our Midwest operating region. Consequently, we determined that our Midwest operating region, which was previously included in our Northeast reporting segment, constitutes a separate reporting segment. The following discussion of goodwill balances and related impairment charges is based on the revised alignment and disaggregation. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired. We test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of September 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill, SFAS No. 142 prescribes a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the 30 Table of Contents reporting units. If the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. At June 30, 2007, we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary because of the significant amount of inventory tested for impairment under SFAS No. 144, the market conditions in the homebuilding industry and the decline in our stock price. We completed the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2007. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units primarily utilizing the expected present values of future cash flows, supported with a market based assessment of fair value for the reporting units, and concluded an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated for operating regions within our Northeast, Southeast, California and West reporting segments. As a result, during the quarter ended June 30, 2007, we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling $425.6 million related to the write off of goodwill in these reporting segments. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we completed the second step of our goodwill impairment analyses, through which we confirmed the appropriateness of our prior quarter write offs and determined that the goodwill balance related to our Midwest reporting segment was completely impaired. Consequently, the goodwill balance in our Midwest reporting segment of $48.5 million, which included $13.5 million transferred from the Southwest reporting segment due to changing our management structure, was written off in the fourth quarter. Total goodwill impairment charges for fiscal 2007 were $474.1 million. In addition, at September 30, 2007, we completed our annual impairment test and determined that the fair values of our South Central and Southwest reporting segments were greater than their carrying values and no impairment of goodwill existed in those segments. Reflecting the fiscal 2007 impairment charges and restatement of the prior year segment balances to conform to the current year presentation, our goodwill balances by reporting segment as of September 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: September 30, Restated 2007 2006 (In millions) Goodwill: Northeast $ $ 39.4 Midwest 48.5 Southeast 11.5 South Central 15.9 15.9 Southwest 79.4 88.9 California 300.3 West 74.4 $ 95.3 $ 578.9 The goodwill assessment procedures of SFAS No. 142 require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates. Continued softness in the homebuilding industry may result in the determination that some or all of our remaining goodwill balance has become impaired, which could result in additional goodwill impairment charges. Income Taxes In fiscal 2007, the benefit from income taxes was $238.7 million, corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year. In fiscal 2006, the provision for income taxes was $753.8 million, corresponding to the income before income taxes for the year. 31 Table of Contents Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 25.1%, compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% in fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2006, resulting in a reduced benefit from income taxes related to the loss in the year, because only approximately 23% of the $474.1 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2007 is deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 40.9% for fiscal 2007. Primarily as a result of recording significant inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2007, the balance of our deferred tax asset increased substantially. The net deferred tax asset of $863.8 million at September 30, 2007 assumes that we will be able to realize the full value of these assets, which will be dependent in part on our ability to generate sufficient profits in future periods. If market conditions within the homebuilding industry do not improve or continue to worsen, it may affect our ability to fully realize the value of these assets, which may require a valuation adjustment and additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations, and such expense could be material. Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region Northeast Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 22% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 22% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $66.1 million in 2007, compared to income of $112.9 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $81.5 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $39.4 million. A decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage (home sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs) of 450 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The core home sales gross profit percentage decline in our South Carolina and New Jersey markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease in the regions profitability. Midwest Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 42% decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $205.3 million in 2007, compared to income of $111.3 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $167.3 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $48.5 million. The majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our Denver market. A decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage of 210 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006, as well as an increase in construction defect expense in Denver also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. Southeast Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 28% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 24% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 6% decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $131.6 million in 2007, compared to income of $346.4 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $210.2 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $11.5 million. A decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage of 1,140 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The core home sales gross profit percentage decline in our Florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease. The Florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006. In 2007, high inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical throughout Florida, resulting in substantial gross profit declines. South Central Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 13% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 16% decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a 5% increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was $122.2 million in 2007, down 29% from 2006. Income before income taxes as a percentage of the regions revenues (operating margin) decreased 130 basis points, to 6.1%, from 7.4% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to 32 Table of Contents a decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage of 70 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006. The core home sales gross profit change was largely due to softening in the San Antonio market, where inventories of new and existing homes have increased, resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders. The recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $24.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 million in 2006, also contributed to the decline in the regions profitability. Southwest Region Homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat, decreasing only 1% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 6% decrease in the average selling price of homes closed, offset by a 5% increase in the number of homes closed. Income before income taxes for the region was $204.6 million in 2007, down 52% from 2006. Operating margin decreased 1,110 basis points, to 10.4%, from 21.5% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage of 1,080 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006. The core home sales gross profit change was largely due to declines in our Phoenix market. The Phoenix market experienced significant price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006. In 2007, higher inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased sales incentives and home price reductions were more common in Phoenix, resulting in gross profit declines. The recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $26.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $4.8 million in 2006, also contributed to the decline in the regions profitability. California Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 39% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $784.1 million in 2007, compared to income of $346.3 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $564.6 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $300.3 million. All of our California markets have incurred inventory impairments, with a larger concentration attributable to our Southern California markets. A decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage of 890 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. Core home sales gross profit percentage declines in our Northern California markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease, as these formerly strong markets weakened in fiscal 2007 from 2006. Most of our California markets experienced rapid, significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005, but they also strained housing affordability for most potential homebuyers in California. Housing affordability remains an issue in California, and credit tightening in the mortgage markets has significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by California homebuyers in recent years. In 2006 and 2007, increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical throughout California as builders attempted to increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory levels and to address affordability concerns, resulting in gross profit declines. West Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 26% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 29% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $159.7 million in 2007, compared to income of $365.8 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $254.5 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $74.4 million. The majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our Las Vegas market. A decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit of 750 basis points in 2007, compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The core home sales gross profit percentage decline in our Las Vegas market had the greatest impact on the overall decrease. The Las Vegas market experienced rapid, significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006, but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers there. Credit tightening in the mortgage markets has also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by Las Vegas homebuyers in recent years. In 2007, inventory levels of new and existing homes were high and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical in Las Vegas new home communities, as builders attempted to increase demand for homes and address affordability concerns, resulting in gross profit declines. 33 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. Based on our revised disaggregation of operating segments and the states within those segments, we have restated the 2006 and 2005 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the 2007 presentation.

The number of net sales orders decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, reflecting the industry wide softening of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets, which began in fiscal 2006. Factors that contributed to the slowing of demand included an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a reduction in investor purchases, an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes and an increase in sales contract cancellation rates. These factors affected our business most significantly in the fourth fiscal quarter, when our net sales orders decreased 25% compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2005. Our annual cancellation rate increased to 28% in fiscal 2006, and our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 increased to approximately 40%, exceeding our typical historical range of 16% to 20%. The higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our Arizona, California and Florida markets. A significant portion of the increase in cancellations was due to our prospective homebuyers being unable to sell their existing homes. Decreases in both the number and value of net sales orders in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 occurred in our Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and California regions. The decreases in sales in these regions were primarily attributable to the changes in market conditions described above. Partially offsetting the decreases in net sales orders was an 18% increase in net sales orders in our South Central region, where many of our markets did not experience the same slowdown in demand during fiscal 2006. The average price of a net sales order in fiscal 2006 was $267,300, a decrease of 3% from the $275,100 average in fiscal 2005. During the year, slight to moderate increases and decreases in average sales prices occurred among our regions, resulting in our relatively flat average price compared to 2005. In general, our ability to raise prices is dependent on the demand for our homes; therefore, the lack of any significant overall price appreciation during 2006 was due in large part to the decrease in demand and our increased use of sales incentives in many markets. Particularly, the home price appreciation that occurred in many of our California, Arizona and Florida markets during fiscal 2005 moderated and, in many instances reversed, during fiscal 2006. As part of our efforts to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base, adjustments to our product and geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets also contributed to decreases in the average selling price. At September 30, 2006, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes), down 11% from $5,835.2 million (19,244 homes) at September 30, 2005. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $286,100 at September 30, 2006, down 6% from the $303,200 average at September 30, 2005. The value of our sales order backlog decreased in five of our seven market regions, led by decreases of 46% and 30% in our Midwest and Southeast regions, respectively, which is reflective of the difficult sales 36 Table of Contents environment. The average selling price of homes in backlog at September 30, 2006 as compared to September 30, 2005 reflected only slight to moderate increases and decreases among our regions. Home Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Revenues from home sales increased 9%, to $14,545.4 million (53,099 homes closed) in 2006 from $13,376.6 million (51,172 homes closed) in 2005. Revenues from home sales increased in all seven of our market regions, led by the Northeast, Southwest and Southeast regions, with increases of 25%, 15% and 13%, respectively. The average selling price of homes closed during 2006 was $273,900, up 5% from $261,400 in 2005. The average selling price of homes closed increased by slight to moderate amounts in six of our seven market regions, led by the Southwest and Southeast regions with increases of 17% and 11%, respectively. Many markets, especially some of the California, Arizona and Florida markets which experienced the most price appreciation during fiscal 2005, experienced weakening demand in the latter part of fiscal 2006, resulting in declines in total and per home revenue. As reflected in our net sales order volume, demand slowed in a number of our markets during fiscal 2006, and in general, we offered more incentives and price concessions to obtain home sales. Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2006 were increased by $1.6 million, while revenues from home sales in fiscal 2005 were reduced by $92.2 million, from changes in profit deferred pursuant to SFAS No. 66. Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 4%, to $3,342.2 million in 2006 from $3,488.3 million in 2005. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 300 basis points, to 22.6% in 2006 from 25.6% in 2005. Gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenues decreased 150 basis points, to 24.0% in 2006 from 25.5% in 2005. The primary factors reducing our home sales gross profit margin were the difficult market conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in many of our markets and caused a decline of approximately 200 basis points in home sales gross margin. In fiscal 2006, we had to utilize additional incentives in many of our markets due to the challenging sales environment. Sales incentives affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home, or by increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price. An additional 45 basis points of home sales gross margin decline was a result of the decrease in the relative number of closings in markets such as California and Nevada, which had significant price appreciation in preceding years and, therefore, had above average gross margins in fiscal 2005. These declines were partially offset by an improvement of approximately 55 basis points related to the increase in home sales revenues and gross profit from the recognition of profit previously deferred in accordance with SFAS No. 66. The remaining improvement of 40 basis points was primarily due to a reduction in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. During fiscal 2006, several communities under development that demonstrated potential impairment indicators, with a combined carrying value of $739.5 million at September 30, 2006, were evaluated for potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Our analyses of these projects generally assumed flat to reduced revenues as compared with current sales orders for the particular project or revenues realized from comparable projects. We determined that projects with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority of which were in California, were impaired. Consequently, we recorded impairment charges of $146.2 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we wrote off $124.7 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land purchase option contracts which we determined we would not pursue. The inventory impairment charges and write offs of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 180 basis points in fiscal 2006. Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) Expense SGA expenses from homebuilding activities increased by $230.0 million, or 19%, to $1,456.6 million in 2006 from $1,226.6 million in 2005. As a percentage of revenues, SGA expenses increased 90 basis points, 37 Table of Contents to 9.9% in 2006 from 9.0% in 2005. The largest component of our homebuilding SGA is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 64% and 67% of SGA costs in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Those costs increased $115.1 million, or 14%, to $932.4 million in 2006 from $817.3 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth. The remaining increase in SGA of $114.9 million was primarily attributable to increases in advertising costs, property taxes, rent expense and subdivision maintenance. These increases were due to the growth in our inventory levels and the competitive selling environment. Interest Incurred We capitalize interest costs only to inventory under construction or development. During both fiscal years, our inventory under construction or development exceeded our debt; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt. Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest impaired, was 2.1% of total home and land/lot cost of sales in 2006, compared to 2.2% in 2005. Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2006 with fiscal 2005, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt increased by 19%, to $325.4 million, due to a 34% increase in our average homebuilding debt. Interest incurred increased at a slower rate than our debt primarily because our debt during 2006 was more heavily weighted to our revolving credit facility, which carried a lower interest rate than the weighted average interest rate of our senior and senior subordinated notes. Our efforts to replace older, higher interest rate notes with notes bearing lower interest rates also contributed to the improvement in relative interest costs. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt In fiscal 2006, in connection with the early retirement of our 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our 10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded a loss of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees, net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded a loss of approximately $4.4 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, in connection with the early retirement of our 9.375% senior notes due 2009, we recorded interest expense of approximately $4.4 million for the call premium and unamortized fees, net of the unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes. Other Income Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $11.0 million in 2006, compared to $15.7 million in 2005. The major component of other income in both 2006 and 2005 was the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps of $3.1 million and $9.5 million, respectively. Also included in other income in 2006 and 2005 was interest income of $6.9 million and $3.9 million, respectively. Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region Northeast Region Homebuilding revenues increased 24% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a 20% increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 17% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the regions revenues, decreased 400 basis points to 8.1%, from 12.1% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the regions core home sales gross profit percentage (home sales gross profit percentage excluding impairments and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs), with the gross margin declines in our Virginia and Coastal Carolina markets having the greatest impact on the overall decrease. Additionally, profitability was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs of $26.9 million in fiscal 2006 versus $0.4 million in fiscal 2005. Midwest Region Homebuilding revenues increased 6% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to a 5% increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the number of homes closed. Income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years, and as a 38 Table of Contents percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 30 basis points to 6.2%, from 6.5% in 2005. This decrease was due to the effect of recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs of $32.5 million in fiscal 2006 versus $1.9 million in fiscal 2005, largely offset by an increase in land sales gross profit and gross profit related to the recognition of profit previously deferred in accordance with SFAS No. 66. Southeast Region Homebuilding revenues increased 12% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an 11% increase in the average selling price of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the number of homes closed. Income before income taxes for the region was relatively flat between the two years; however, as a percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 250 basis points to 17.0%, from 19.5% in 2005. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the regions gross profit percentage, which was negatively affected by the recording of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs of $34.4 million in fiscal 2006 versus $3.8 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding these charges, we experienced similar core home sales gross profit margins in both fiscal years; however, we did experience a sharp decline in these margins during the second half of fiscal 2006, reflecting the softening market conditions, especially in Florida. South Central Region Homebuilding revenues increased 9% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 26% higher in 2006 compared to 2005, and as a percentage of the regions revenues, increased 100 basis points to 7.4%, from 6.4% in 2005. This increase in income before income taxes was primarily due to a decrease in the regions selling, general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues, as gross margin for the region was comparable from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Southwest Region Homebuilding revenues increased 17% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to a 17% increase in the average selling price of homes closed, while the number of homes closed decreased 2%. Income before income taxes for the region was 15% higher in 2006 compared to 2005; however, as a percentage of the regions revenues, it decreased 20 basis points to 21.5%, from 21.7% in 2005. While core homebuilding margin was relatively flat in the Phoenix market for the full fiscal year 2006 as compared with fiscal year 2005, we did experience a sharp decline in the Phoenix market home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 as compared with the earlier quarters. California Region Homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat, increasing only 1% in 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting a slight increase in the number of homes closed and a slight decline in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 54% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the regions revenues, decreased 1,120 basis points to 9.5%, from 20.7% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the regions gross profit percentage, which was significantly affected by a decline of approximately 600 basis points in the regions core home sales gross margins with the largest declines in the Sacramento and San Diego markets. In addition, the recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs of $165.8 million in fiscal 2006 versus $9.2 million in fiscal 2005 had a significant negative impact on gross margins. West Region Homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat, increasing only 2% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to slight increases in both the number of homes closed and in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was 13% lower in 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of the regions revenues, decreased 390 basis points to 22.9%, from 26.8% in 2005. This decrease was due to a decrease in the regions gross profit percentage, primarily attributable to lower gross margins in the Las Vegas market. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations Financial Services Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising DHI Mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 2006 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

Total first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 24% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, corresponding to 40 Table of Contents the decrease in the number of homes closed of 22%. The percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers financing), to 66% in 2007, from 68% in 2006. Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2007, compared to 94% in 2006. These rates reflect DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. The number of loans sold to third party investors decreased by 29% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated. During fiscal 2007, the market for certain non traditional mortgage loans changed substantially, resulting in the reduced availability of some loan products that had previously been available to borrowers. The affected loan products were generally characterized by high combined loan to value ratios in combination with less required documentation than traditional mortgage loans. Such loans constituted approximately half of our total originations during fiscal 2006, but such products declined substantially as a percentage of total originations during fiscal 2007, primarily in the third and fourth quarters. As a percentage of total loans originated, originations of traditional conforming, conventional loans and FHA or VA insured loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, to approximately 90%, corresponding to the reduction in non traditional mortgage loans. Financial Services Revenues and Expenses Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 29%, to $207.7 million in 2007 from $290.8 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold. The majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. Additionally, we increased our loan loss reserves from $15.6 million at September 30, 2006, to $24.6 million at September 30, 2007 to cover estimated losses on loans held in portfolio, loans held for sale, and future obligations related to loans sold with recourse. The increase in this reserve resulted in a corresponding decrease to the gains on sale of mortgages, and reflects the current market conditions related to non traditional products as described above, as well as potential repurchase obligations that exist on certain loans previously sold. General and administrative (GA) expenses associated with financial services decreased 24%, to $153.8 million in 2007 from $202.2 million in 2006. The largest component of our financial services GA expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 75% and 77% of GA costs in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Those costs decreased 26%, to $114.9 million in 2007 from $155.4 million in 2006, as we have aligned the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels. Our financial services operations employed approximately 1,100 and 1,700 employees at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As a percentage of financial services revenues, GA expenses increased by 450 basis points, to 74.0% in 2007, from 69.5% in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2007 and an increase in loan loss expense discussed above. Fluctuations in financial services general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned, as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume. Interest and other income decreased 32%, to $38.5 million in 2007 from $56.9 million in 2006, primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations. 41 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2005 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 2005 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

The increase in loans originated or brokered was greater than our 4% increase in the number of homes closed because our mortgage capture rate increased to 68% in 2006 from 63% in 2005. Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 94% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2006, compared to 93% in 2005, reflecting DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. 42 Table of Contents The number of loans sold to third party investors increased 41% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated, as well as the implementation of more efficient loan sale processes during fiscal 2006. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2006 includes the effect of the sales of an unusually high volume of mortgage loans held at September 30, 2005. Financial Services Revenues and Expenses Revenues from the financial services segment increased 24%, to $290.8 million in 2006 from $235.1 million in 2005. The increase in financial services revenues was primarily due to the increase in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold, partially offset by a slight decrease in the average mortgage revenues earned per loan sold. The decline in revenue per loan was largely due to less favorable selling conditions for mortgage originations and the interest rate environment in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations are recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. GA expenses associated with financial services increased 37%, to $202.2 million in 2006 from $147.6 million in 2005. The largest component of our financial services GA expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 77% and 76% of GA costs in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Those costs increased 39%, to $155.4 million in 2006 from $111.6 million in 2005, largely due to the addition of employees to support our previously planned growth. As a percentage of financial services revenues, GA expenses increased by 670 basis points, to 69.5% in 2006 from 62.8% in 2005, reflecting the growth of our financial services infrastructure at a faster rate than the growth in revenues during fiscal 2006. Interest and other income increased 63%, to $56.9 million in 2006 from $34.9 million in 2005, primarily due to increases in loan origination volume and interest rates. Overview of Current Capital Resources and Liquidity We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. As we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations, we have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. At September 30, 2007, our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 40.2%, a decrease of 50 basis points from 40.7% at September 30, 2006. Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity). The decrease in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at September 30, 2007 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to paying down our homebuilding debt with cash flows from operations, partially offset by the decrease in retained earnings and cash. Our target operating range for net homebuilding debt to total capital is below 45%, so the 40.2% ratio at September 30, 2007 is in line with our operating target. We remain focused on maintaining our liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet so we can be flexible in reacting to market conditions; however, future fiscal year end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the fiscal 2007 year end ratio. We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its debt is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities. Because of its capital function, we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital. For comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above, at September 30, 2007 and 2006, our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital, without netting cash balances, were 41.7% and 43.1%, respectively. We believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs (including debt maturities) through a combination of our existing cash resources, 43 Table of Contents cash flows from operations, our existing, renewed or amended credit facilities and, if needed, the issuance of new securities through the public capital markets. Homebuilding Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents At September 30, 2007, we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of $228.3 million. Bank Credit Facility During November 2006, we increased the size of our $2.15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a $1.0 billion letter of credit sub facility, to $2.5 billion and extended its maturity by one year to December 16, 2011. The revolving credit facility has an uncommitted $400 million accordion provision which could be used to increase the facility to $2.9 billion upon obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. We borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements, and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and from the issuance of public securities. We had $150.0 million in cash borrowings outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at September 30, 2007, and $800.0 million in cash borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2006. Our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including limits on investments, cash dividends, stock repurchases and incurrence of indebtedness, and requires maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum level of tangible net worth and a minimum ratio of earnings before income taxes, depreciation, amortization, asset valuation adjustments and non cash gains and losses to interest incurred. At September 30, 2007, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of our bank revolving credit facility and our public debt obligations. Our continued borrowing availability depends on our ability to remain in compliance with these covenants, limitations and restrictions. Additionally, if it appears that we will not be able to comply with these requirements in the future, it could be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional financing. The following table presents the levels required to maintain our compliance with the financial debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, and the levels achieved as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. These debt covenants are required to be maintained by us and all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, Guarantor Subsidiaries), other than the financial services subsidiaries and certain inconsequential subsidiaries (collectively, Non Guarantor Subsidiaries). Level Achieved as of or for the Year Ended Required September 30, Level 2007 Leverage Ratio (1) 0.60 to 1.0 or less 0.42 to 1.0 Ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Incurred (2) At least 2.0 to 1.0 3.6 to 1.0 Minimum Tangible Net Worth (3) (in millions) $4,301.5 $5,314.4 (1) The Leverage Ratio is calculated by deducting a portion of cash and cash equivalents from our notes payable (net notes payable) and dividing by the sum of stockholders equity and net notes payable. (2) Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding the following items to pre tax income: Interest expensed and amortized to cost of sales Depreciation and amortization Inventory impairments, land option cost write offs and goodwill impairments (3) Minimum Tangible Net Worth is calculated by deducting goodwill from stockholders equity. In July 2007, through amendment to the revolving credit facility, a restriction was removed that limited our ability to pay cash dividends to an annual amount not to exceed 50% of prior year consolidated net income. Under the amended agreement, payment of dividends is permitted provided there is no payment 44 Table of Contents default under the facility, we are in compliance with certain financial covenants under the agreement, and such payments do not cause us to be in noncompliance with those financial covenants. Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, if we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poors Ratings Services, we would be subject to a borrowing base limitation and restrictions on unsold homes and residential land and lots. The borrowing base covenant limits our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity to the amount determined under the arrangement, which was in excess of our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility. The borrowing capacity under our homebuilding revolving credit facility was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2007 and would not have been affected had the restriction been in place. Additional restrictions limit the ratio of our unsold homes to the trailing twelve months unit home closings to 40%, and limit the ratio of our residential land and lots to tangible net worth to 150%. At September 30, 2007, these ratios were approximately 26% and 110%, respectively. Although our ratings were in the lowest investment grade category at each agency, and during fiscal 2007 they were placed on negative outlook by all the three rating agencies, at September 30, 2007, we still held investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies, so the borrowing base limitation was not in effect. In October 2007, Moodys Investors Service placed our senior debt rating under review for downgrade, and in November 2007, Standard and Poors Ratings Services downgraded our senior debt rating by one level to BB+, which is below investment grade status. Repayments of Public Unsecured Debt On April 15, 2007, we redeemed our 8.5% senior notes due 2012 at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $260.6 million, plus accrued interest. Concurrent with the redemption, we recorded a loss related to the early retirement of debt of approximately $12.1 million, representing the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. We used proceeds from our revolving credit facility for the redemption. Shelf Registration Statements We have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. Also, at September 30, 2007, we had the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business acquisitions. Financial Services Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents At September 30, 2007, we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million. Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility DHI Mortgage has a $540 million mortgage warehouse loan facility that was renewed on March 30, 2007 to extend its maturity from April 6, 2007 to March 28, 2008. Under the accordion provision of the credit agreement, the total capacity may be increased to $750 million upon obtaining additional commitments from lenders. At September 30, 2007, we had borrowings of $267.8 million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility. Our borrowing capacity under this facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement. Under the borrowing base limitation, the amount that may be drawn on our mortgage warehouse facility varies based upon the underlying product type of each eligible mortgage loan. Substantially all of our mortgage originations are eligible, with advance rates typically ranging from 95% to 98% of the unpaid principal balance of each mortgage loan. Commercial Paper Conduit Facility DHI Mortgage also has a $600 million commercial paper conduit facility (the CP conduit facility) that matures June 27, 2009, subject to the annual renewal of the 364 day backup liquidity feature. This credit facility, which previously had a capacity of $1.2 billion, was amended in December 2006 to reduce the capacity to $800 million, and upon renewal of the backup liquidity feature in 45 Table of Contents June 2007, was further amended to reduce the capacity to $600 million. At September 30, 2007, we had borrowings of $120.0 million outstanding under the CP conduit facility. In the past, we have been able to renew or extend the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to renew and extend these facilities or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities. The recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets has increased the financing costs related to mortgage secured borrowings and may affect our ability to renew and extend these borrowing facilities on similar terms. The mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility are not guaranteed by either D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. Borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale, and by restricted cash to the extent borrowings under the facility occur prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale as collateral. The mortgage loans assigned to secure the CP conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multi seller conduits in the commercial paper market. At September 30, 2007, our financial services subsidiaries held total mortgage loans for sale of $523.5 million. All mortgage company activities have been financed with the mortgage warehouse facility, the CP conduit facility or internally generated funds. Both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants as to our mortgage subsidiarys minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required net income. In addition, the CP conduit facility contains certain advance cessation triggers based on specified performance metrics of the Company and its Guarantor Subsidiaries which govern the availability of credit under the facility. At September 30, 2007, our financial services subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the CP conduit facility. Operating Cash Flow Activities During the year ended September 30, 2007, net cash provided by our operating activities was $1.4 billion, as compared to cash used in operating activities during the prior year of $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2007, we generated positive cash flows from operating activities as we produced operating profits, excluding the impact of asset impairments and write offs. We also limited our investments in inventory during fiscal 2007, as evidenced by a $737.6 million decrease in owned inventory (excluding the impact of impairments and write offs) during the fiscal year, compared to $3.1 billion of inventory growth in fiscal 2006. In light of the challenging market conditions, we have substantially slowed our purchases of land and lots and our development spending on land we own, and have restricted the number of homes under construction to better match our expected current rate of home sales and closings. We plan to continue to reduce our number of homes under construction during fiscal 2008 by starting construction on fewer homes than we close, and continue to significantly limit our development spending. Our ability to reduce our inventory levels is, however, heavily dependent upon our ability to close a sufficient number of homes during the year, which may be negatively impacted if our sales order cancellation rate remains at elevated levels. To the extent our inventory levels decrease during fiscal 2008, we expect to generate net positive cash flows from operating activities in fiscal 2008, should all other factors remain constant. Another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal 2007 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of $499.4 million during the year. The decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. We expect to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow. However, in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior periods, or if our mortgage capture rate declines, the amounts of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2007. 46 Table of Contents Investing Cash Flow Activities In fiscal 2007 and 2006, cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, but were reduced in fiscal 2007 in light of the weaker market conditions. Financing Cash Flow Activities The majority of our short term financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long term financing needs of our homebuilding operations are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. Borrowings by our mortgage subsidiary under the CP conduit facility are secured by the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale and restricted cash arising from borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of the mortgage loans as collateral. At September 30, 2007, there were no borrowings under the facility prior to the assignment of mortgage loans held for sale, and therefore, no cash was restricted under this facility for this purpose. At September 30, 2006, the balance of cash restricted for this purpose was $248.3 million. During fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share, the last of which was paid on August 27, 2007 to stockholders of record on August 17, 2007. On October 24, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, which was paid on November 16, 2007, to stockholders of record on November 5, 2007. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our financial condition and general business conditions. Changes in Capital Structure In November 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $463.2 million of our common stock and the repurchase of debt securities of up to $500 million. These authorizations replaced the previous common stock and debt securities repurchase authorizations and were in effect through November 30, 2007. As of September 30, 2007, the full amount of both authorizations remained available for repurchases. In November 2007, our Board of Directors renewed and extended both authorizations to November 30, 2008. In fiscal 2007, our primary non operating uses of our available capital were the repayment of debt, and dividend payments, which we expect to remain as our top priorities in fiscal 2008. We continue to evaluate our alternatives for future non operating uses of our available capital, including the amounts of planned debt repayments, dividend payments, maintenance of cash balances and possible common stock repurchases, based on market conditions and other circumstances, and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets, our liquidity targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements and indentures. Contractual Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by accessing the public capital markets. 47 Table of Contents Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2007 are presented below: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Homebuilding: Notes Payable (1) $ 5,181.0 $ 483.5 $ 1,385.8 $ 1,197.8 $ 2,113.9 Operating Leases 85.6 24.5 37.9 15.7 7.5 Purchase Obligations 60.8 27.8 33.0 Totals $ 5,327.4 $ 535.8 $ 1,456.7 $ 1,213.5 $ 2,121.4 Financial Services: Notes Payable (2) $ 410.6 $ 410.6 $ $ $ Operating Leases 7.2 3.1 3.5 0.6 Totals $ 417.8 $ 413.7 $ 3.5 $ 0.6 $ (1) Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our senior and senior subordinated notes, our revolving credit facility and our secured notes. The principal amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to be $150 million through its maturity, and the related interest obligation is based on the effective rate of 6.0% as of September 30, 2007. (2) Financial services notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiarys warehouse loan facility and commercial paper conduit facility. The interest obligations associated with these variable rate facilities are based on their effective rates of 5.9% on both facilities, and principal balances outstanding at September 30, 2007. At September 30, 2007, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $97.7 million and surety bonds of $2.1 billion, issued by third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third party guarantees. Our financial services subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II of this annual report on Form 10 K. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. Within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at September 30, 2007, there were a limited number of contracts, representing only $60.8 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting certain obligations. Also, pursuant to the provisions of Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 as amended (FIN 46), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of $65.8 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. Additionally, pursuant to SFAS No. 49, Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements, we recorded $56.1 million of land inventory not owned related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts. Further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory section that follows. 48 Table of Contents Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory The following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at September 30, 2007 and 2006: September 30, 2007 2006 Lots Lots Controlled Controlled Lots Owned Under Lot Total Lots Owned Under Lot Total Developed Option and Land/Lots Homes Developed Option and Land/Lots Homes and Under Similar Owned and in and Under Similar Owned and in Development Contracts Controlled Inventory Development Contracts Controlled Inventory Northeast 14,000 12,000 26,000 1,800 16,000 19,000 35,000 2,800 Midwest 10,000 3,000 13,000 1,900 12,000 15,000 27,000 2,900 Southeast 32,000 14,000 46,000 3,400 32,000 33,000 65,000 5,200 South Central 31,000 15,000 46,000 4,400 34,000 36,000 70,000 7,400 Southwest 38,000 8,000 46,000 3,100 46,000 9,000 55,000 4,300 California 14,000 9,000 23,000 3,300 19,000 15,000 34,000 3,900 West 28,000 2,000 30,000 2,000 31,000 6,000 37,000 2,000 167,000 63,000 230,000 19,900 190,000 133,000 323,000 28,500 73% 27% 100% 59% 41% 100% At September 30, 2007, we owned or controlled approximately 230,000 lots, 27% of which were lots under option or similar contracts, compared with approximately 323,000 lots at September 30, 2006. Our current strategy is to continue to reduce our owned and controlled lot position in line with our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings, through the construction and sale of homes, opportunistic sales of land and lots, along with critical evaluation of acquiring lots currently controlled under option. At September 30, 2007, we controlled approximately 63,000 lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately $1.8 billion under land and lot option purchase contracts, with a total of $109.3 million in earnest money deposits. Our lots controlled included approximately 18,200 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately $548.5 million and secured by deposits totaling $34.4 million, for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not yet been terminated. Consequently, we have written off the deposits related to these contracts, resulting in a net earnest money deposit balance of $74.9 million at September 30, 2007. We had a total of approximately 19,900 homes in inventory, including approximately 2,000 model homes at September 30, 2007, compared to approximately 28,500 homes in inventory, including approximately 1,900 model homes at September 30, 2006. Of our total homes in inventory, approximately 10,600 and 14,200 were unsold at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At September 30, 2007, approximately 5,000 of our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 1,100 had been completed for more than six months. At September 30, 2006, approximately 5,000 of our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 440 homes had been completed for more than six months. Our strategy is to continue to reduce our total number of homes in inventory and our number of unsold homes in inventory during fiscal 2008, in line with our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings. Seasonality We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Before the current housing downturn, we generally had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of seasonal activity, our results of 49 Table of Contents operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year. In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to further deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during fiscal 2007, we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. These results were primarily due to recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges. Also, the increasingly challenging market conditions caused further weakening in sales volume, pricing and margins as the fiscal year progressed. Although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur. Inflation We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. However, during periods of soft housing market conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases, particularly higher land costs, with higher selling prices. Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate, believe, consider, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, objective, plan, predict, projection, seek, strategy, target or other words of similar meaning. Any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience, and the expectations derived from them may not be realized, due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forward looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to: further deterioration in industry conditions; the reduction of liquidity in the financial markets; limitations on our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; changes in general economic, real estate, construction and other business conditions; changes in interest rates, the availability of mortgage financing or other costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters; our substantial debt; competitive conditions within our industry; the availability of capital; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; and the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters. 50 Table of Contents We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K should be consulted. Further discussion of these and other risk considerations is provided in Item 1A Risk Factors under Part I of this annual report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies General A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2007 and 2006, and for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected. Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. We have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts, under the requirements of FIN 46. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed. We include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances. We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers. We recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors. Origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses, respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights, when the loans are sold. We generally do not retain or service the mortgages that we originate but, rather, sell the mortgages and related servicing rights to third party investors. Interest income is accrued from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Mortgage loans held for sale are generally carried at cost adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation of an effective accounting hedge, based on either sale commitments or current market quotes. Some of the loans sold by DHI Mortgage are sold with limited recourse provisions and may be required to be repurchased under certain conditions including if certain specified payment(s), generally initial payment(s), are not made by the borrowers. We record loss allowances for loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale, and 51 Table of Contents reserves for losses related to loans sold with recourse, utilizing estimates based on historical experience and current market conditions. Unhedged loans are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined by either sales commitments or current market conditions. Inventories and Cost of Sales Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SGA expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of construction superintendents, sales personnel and division and region management, advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SGA expense as incurred. Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. We use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project. When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each months accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, historically, differences in amounts have not been significant. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present. SFAS No. 144 requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of the amounts and timing of revenues and costs and other factors which, in turn, are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed projects when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair value less costs to sell these homes. Land Inventory Not Owned We account for our land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46. FIN 46 provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities, which FIN 46 defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities. FIN 46 requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. In the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase contracts, we will fund a 52 Table of Contents stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion. Under the requirements of FIN 46, certain of the option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option. In applying the provisions of FIN 46, we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated. Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to FIN 46, we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of September 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill, SFAS No. 142 prescribes a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. If the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. Warranty Costs We have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods. The one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten year period is for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. Insurance Claim Costs We have, and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have, general liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors. We self insure a portion of our overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us, naming some subcontractors as additional insureds. We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported. Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Because of the high 53 Table of Contents degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the self insured accruals would result in a change of approximately $50.0 million in our accrual. Income Taxes We calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Stock based Compensation With the approval of our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period. On October 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109, Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings. SAB No. 109, which revises and rescinds portions of SAB No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments, specifically states that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. The provisions of SAB No. 109 are applicable to written loan commitments issued or modified beginning on January 1, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SAB No. 109. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. The statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue (EITF) No. 06 8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66 for Sales of Condominiums. EITF 06 8 establishes that an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyers continuing investment in determining whether to recognize profit under the percentage of completion method. EITF 06 8 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after March 15, 2007. The adoption of EITF 06 8 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 54 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement 109. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact of the adoption of FIN 48 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings. We generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. Our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps, and such changes are reflected in our statements of operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put options on mortgage backed securities (MBS) and EDFC. Use of the term hedging instruments in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively, or in any combination. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. The hedging instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. Hedging instruments related to funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges, with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2007, hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $630.4 million. Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which are generally less than six months, totaled approximately $154.4 million, and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately $129.2 million at September 30, 2007. The fair value of the hedging instruments and IRLCs at September 30, 2007 was an insignificant amount. We also purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic interest rate hedges as part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing. At September 30, 2007, these potential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately $124.9 million and were hedged with FRAs 55 Table of Contents of $72.1 million and economic interest rate hedges of $526.9 million in EDFC put options and $29.6 million in MBS put options. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months. These instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. The gains and losses for the year ended September 30, 2007 were not significant. The following table sets forth principal cash flows by expected maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2007. The interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at September 30, 2007. In addition, the table sets forth the notional amounts, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps. Because the mortgage warehouse credit facility and CP conduit facility are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days, the outstanding balances at September 30, 2007 are included in the variable rate maturities for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2007, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million liability.
