ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2008 Overview Our fiscal 2008 results reflect the challenges that the homebuilding industry faced during the year. During fiscal 2008 the factors hurting demand for new homes became more intense and pervasive across the United States. As a result, the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging. High inventory levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year. The effects of these factors were further magnified by credit tightening in the mortgage markets, increasing home foreclosures and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets. The liquidity shortage has caused concern about the viability of many financial institutions and has negatively impacted the already weakening economy, which has created fears of a prolonged recession. These factors, combined with our continued elevated sales cancellation rate, caused our sales volume to be significantly reduced. Also, our gross profit from home sales revenues continued to decline as we offered higher levels of incentives and price concessions in attempts to stimulate demand in our communities. As we progressed though fiscal 2008, our disappointing sales results, further declines in our sales order prices, continued declines in our gross profit from home sales revenues and the more challenging market conditions caused our outlook for the homebuilding industry to remain cautious. We believe that housing market conditions may continue to deteriorate, and that the timing of a recovery in the housing market remains unclear. Our outlook incorporates several factors, including continued margin pressure from sales price reductions and incentives; continued high levels of new and existing homes available for sale; weak demand from new home consumers; continued high sales cancellations; significant restrictions on the availability of certain mortgage products and an overall increase in the underwriting requirements for home financing as a result of the recent credit tightening in the mortgage markets. During fiscal 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future demand. Consummating these transactions during the current fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund. Due to the declining market conditions discussed above, we evaluated a significant portion of our inventory in our quarterly impairment analyses during fiscal 2008. Additionally, we evaluated the recoverability of our goodwill. Our goodwill and inventory impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increasing challenges in the homebuilding industry, and our belief that these challenging conditions will persist for some time. Based on our evaluations and as a result of our fourth quarter land and lot sales, we recorded significant impairment charges to our inventory and goodwill balances during the year, which materially affected our operating results during fiscal 2008. Strategy We believe the long term fundamentals which support housing demand, namely population growth and household formation, remain solid. We also believe the negative effects of the current market conditions, although unyielding in the near term, will moderate over the long term. In the interim, we remain committed to the following initiatives related to our operating strategy in the current homebuilding business environment: Reducing our land and lot inventory from current levels by: selling and constructing homes; opportunistically selling excess land and lots; significantly restricting our spending for land and lot purchases; 23 Table of Contents decreasing our land development spending or suspending development in many communities until market conditions improve; and renegotiating or canceling land option purchase contracts. Controlling our inventory of homes under construction by limiting the construction of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold, completed homes in inventory. Managing the sales prices and level of sales incentives on our homes as necessary to optimize the balance of sales volumes, returns and cash flows. Decreasing our cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors. Continuing to modify our product offerings to provide more affordable homes. Decreasing our SGA infrastructure to be in line with our reduced expectations of production levels. Reducing our level of debt by utilizing cash balances and cash flows from operations. Maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position. These initiatives allowed us to generate significant cash flows from operations during fiscal 2007 and 2008, which we utilized to reduce our outstanding debt and increase our liquidity. Although we cannot provide any assurances that these initiatives will be successful, we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2009.

Results of Operations Homebuilding Our operating segments are our 34 homebuilding operating divisions, which we aggregate into six reporting segments. Previously, we presented seven homebuilding reporting segments, based on our seven operating regions which had been determined to be our operating segments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we reassessed the level at which the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131 operating segment criteria is met, and as a result, changed our operating segments from the operating regions to the operating divisions. As a result of this change, the composition of our reporting segments was also revised. The California markets, which were previously presented as a separate reporting segment are now included in our West reporting segment. Additionally, the Salt Lake City, Utah market, which was previously included in our Southwest reporting segment, is now included in our West reporting segment. Furthermore, the name of our Northeast reporting segment has been changed to our East reporting segment, although the markets comprising it remain the same. All prior year segment information has been restated to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation. These reporting segments, which we also refer to as reporting regions, have homebuilding operations located in the following states: East: Delaware, Georgia (Savannah only), Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia Midwest: Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin Southeast: Alabama, Florida and Georgia South Central: Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas Southwest: Arizona and New Mexico West: California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington 25 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. We have restated the 2007 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the 2008 presentation.

The value of net sales orders decreased 43%, to $4,677.2 million (21,251 homes) in 2008 from $8,230.6 million (33,687 homes) in 2007. The value of net sales orders decreased 35%, to $852.3 million (3,977 homes) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 from $1,309.5 million (6,374 homes) in the same period of fiscal 2007. The decreases in our net sales orders reflect the continued reduction of demand for new homes in most homebuilding markets. We believe the most significant factors contributing to the slowing of demand for new homes in most of our markets include a continued high level of new and existing homes for sale, which includes foreclosed homes for sale, a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers which has been further impacted by the recent uncertainty in the financial markets and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence. Many prospective homebuyers continue to approach the purchase decision more tentatively due to continued increases in price concessions and sales incentives offered on both new and existing homes, concern over their ability to sell an existing home or obtain mortgage financing and the general uncertainty surrounding the housing market and weakness in the overall economy. We have attempted to increase sales by providing increased sales incentives and lowering prices, but the factors above, combined with the continued pricing responses of our competitors, have limited the impact of our pricing efforts. Reflecting the recent significant erosion of consumer confidence, our sales results during the fourth quarter worsened at the end of the quarter. The elimination of seller funded down payment assistance on FHA loans as of October 1, 2008 will likely have a negative effect on future sales trends as further discussed below. Subsequent to fiscal year 2008, the volume of our net sales orders for the month ended October 31, 2008 continued the weakness experienced at the end of the fourth quarter and decreased 23% compared to the month ended October 31, 2007. In comparing fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007, the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions. These decreases were primarily due to substantially similar decreases in the number of homes sold in the respective region. Particularly in our West region, the decline in average selling price also contributed to the decline in the value of net sales orders. The average price of our net sales orders decreased 10%, to $220,100 in 2008 from $244,300 in 2007. The average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our West region, and to a lesser extent in our Midwest and Southeast regions, due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our California, Las Vegas, Denver and Florida markets. In general, our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes, and declines in our average selling prices during fiscal 2008 were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives in order to attempt to achieve an appropriate sales absorption pace. Further, as the inventory of existing homes for sale, which includes an increasing number of foreclosed homes, has continued to be high, it has led to the need to ensure our pricing is competitive with comparable existing home sales prices. We monitor and may adjust our product mix, geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets in an effort to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base, typically first time and move up homebuyers. To a lesser extent than the competitive factors discussed above, this has also contributed to decreases in the average selling price. Our annual cancellation rate (cancelled sales orders divided by gross sales orders for the period) was 40% in fiscal 2008, compared to 38% in fiscal 2007. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 was 47% and in the month ended October 31, 2008 was 41%. The higher cancellation rate during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, was primarily attributable to cancellations in our Southwest region, particularly in our Arizona markets. These elevated cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most of our homebuilding markets, including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes, the continued erosion of buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets. The impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late fiscal 2007 and into fiscal 2008 as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or the buyers could no longer qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines. The shortage of liquidity in the financial markets during fiscal 2008 has 29 Table of Contents further restricted the availability of credit. We anticipate that cancellation rates will remain elevated and may continue to fluctuate substantially until market conditions improve. In July 2008, Congress passed and the President signed into law H.R. 3221, which includes the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Among other provisions, this law eliminates seller funded down payment assistance on FHA insured loans approved on or after October 1, 2008. Of our total home closings in fiscal 2008, approximately 25% were funded with mortgage loans whereby the homebuyer used a seller financed down payment assistance program. This is a significantly higher percentage of closings than experienced in prior years. The use of such programs during fiscal 2008 was highest in our South Central and Southwest regions. While we will seek other down payment assistance and mortgage financing alternatives for our buyers, we expect the elimination of the seller financed down payment assistance programs to have a negative impact on our future sales and revenues. Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. Before the current housing downturn, our backlog had been an indicator of the level of home closings in our two subsequent fiscal quarters; however, due to our current elevated cancellation rates, higher levels of unsold homes in inventory and difficult conditions in our markets, this relationship between backlog and future home closings has changed. At September 30, 2008, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $1,207.4 million (5,297 homes), a decrease of 55% from $2,694.4 million (10,442 homes) at September 30, 2007. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $227,900 at September 30, 2008, down 12% from the $258,000 average at September 30, 2007. The value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly across all of our market regions, reflecting the severity and geographic reach of the national housing downturn. Home Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Revenues from home sales decreased 43%, to $6,164.3 million (26,396 homes closed) in 2008 from $10,721.2 million (41,370 homes closed) in 2007. The average selling price of homes closed during 2008 was $233,500, down 10% from $259,200 in 2007. During fiscal 2008, home sales revenues decreased significantly in all of our market regions, reflecting continued weak demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during the year. The number of homes closed in 2008 decreased 36% due to decreases in all of our market regions. As a result of the decline in net sales orders during the year and the decline in our sales order backlog, we expect to close fewer homes in fiscal 2009 than we did in fiscal 2008. As conditions change in the housing markets in which we operate, our ongoing level of net sales orders will determine the number of home closings and amount of revenue we will generate. Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were increased by $26.8 million and $58.0 million, respectively, from changes in profit deferred pursuant to SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The home sales profit related to our mortgage loans held for sale is deferred in instances where a buyer finances a home through our wholly owned mortgage company and has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66. As of September 30, 2008, the balance of deferred profit related to these mortgage loans held for sale was $5.8 million, compared to $32.6 million at September 30, 2007. The decline is mainly due to the reduced availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the SFAS No. 66 profit deferral. Gross profit from home sales decreased by 63%, to $691.2 million in 2008, from $1,848.9 million in 2007, and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased 600 basis points, to 11.2%. The primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets, causing a decline of approximately 430 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues. Due to the current sales environment in many of our markets, we have offered a variety of incentives and price concessions, which affect our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing 30 Table of Contents the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price. We are also offering greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of completed homes, which is at a higher than desired level. This strategy helped reduce our completed homes in inventory, but also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit. Additionally, our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 210 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues, and 10 basis points due to the recognition of a lesser amount of previously deferred gross profit during 2008 compared to 2007. These decreases were partially offset by an improvement of 50 basis points due to a decrease in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. During fiscal 2008, when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized reflected our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business. This outlook incorporates our belief that housing market conditions may continue to deteriorate, and that these challenging conditions will persist for some time. Accordingly, our impairment evaluation as of September 30, 2008 again indicated a significant number of communities with impairment indicators. Communities with a combined carrying value of $2,186.2 million as of September 30, 2008, had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment. The analysis of each of these communities generally assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community or for comparable communities in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given community in the current market conditions, we estimated the remaining lives of these communities to range from six months to in excess of ten years. Through this evaluation process, we determined that communities with a carrying value of $967.8 million as of September 30, 2008, the largest portions of which were in the West and Southeast regions, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $364.7 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired communities to their estimated fair value. Due to the significant decline in demand for new homes, we have reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes, as well as our expected need for land and lots in the future. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold a significant amount of land and lots. In connection with these land and lot sales, we recorded impairment charges of $624.2 million to reduce the $814.4 million carrying value of this inventory to its net realizable value. Including impairments related to land sales, impairment charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaled $988.9 million, as compared to $278.3 million in the prior year period. The fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of $2,372.6 million and $1,222.2 million during fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. We perform our impairment analysis based on total inventory at the community level. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes, residential land and lots developed and under development, and land held for development, based on the stage of production or plans for future development. During fiscal 2008, excluding impairments related to land sales, approximately 79% of the impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development, and approximately 21% of the charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes inventory, compared to 74% and 26%, respectively, in fiscal 2007. Of the remaining $1,218.4 million of projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at September 30, 2008, the largest concentrations were in Florida (18%), Texas (13%) and California (12%). It is possible that our estimate of undiscounted cash flows from these communities may change and could result in a future need to record impairment charges to write these assets down to fair value. Additionally, if conditions in the broader economy, homebuilding industry or specific markets in which we operate worsen beyond current expectations, and as we re evaluate specific community pricing and incentives and our land sale strategies, we may be required to evaluate additional communities or re evaluate previously impaired communities for potential impairment. These evaluations may result in additional impairment charges, which could be material. Based on a quarterly review of land and lot option contracts, we have written off earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land and lot option contracts which we no longer plan to pursue. During 31 Table of Contents fiscal 2008 and 2007, we wrote off $111.9 million and $107.3 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land option purchase contracts. Should the current weak homebuilding market conditions persist and we are unable to successfully renegotiate certain land purchase contracts, we may write off additional earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs. The inventory impairment charges and write offs of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 3,810 basis points in fiscal 2008, compared to 1,200 basis points in fiscal 2007. Land Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Land sales revenues decreased 4% to $354.3 million in 2008, from $367.6 million in 2007. The gross profit percentage from land sales decreased to 8.5% in 2008, from 22.9% in 2007. Due to the significant decline in demand for new homes, we have reduced our expectations of future home closing volumes, as well as our expected need for land and lots in the future. Consequently, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory supply in certain markets. Consummating these transactions during the current fiscal year allowed us to monetize a larger portion of our deferred tax assets through a loss carryback to fiscal 2006 resulting in an increase in our expected tax refund. The terms of certain of these land and lot sales, primarily related to our continuing involvement with the properties, resulted in the deferral of the recognition of the sale transaction in some cases. Consequently, $21.7 million of inventory, reflecting its current fair value, is recorded as a component of inventory not owned. In markets where we own more land and lots than our expected needs in the next few years, we plan to attempt to sell these excess lots and land parcels. As of September 30, 2008, we had $39.4 million of land held for sale which we expect to sell in the next 12 months. Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) Expense SGA expense from homebuilding activities decreased by $349.7 million, or 31%, to $791.8 million in 2008 from $1,141.5 million in 2007. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SGA expense increased 180 basis points, to 12.1% in 2008 from 10.3% in 2007, due to a decrease in revenues. The largest component of our homebuilding SGA expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 53% and 59% of SGA costs in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Those costs decreased $254.2 million, or 38%, to $417.9 million in 2008 from $672.2 million in 2007, largely due to our continued efforts to align the number of employees to match our current and anticipated home closing levels, as well as a decrease in incentive compensation, which is primarily based on profitability. Our homebuilding operations employed approximately 3,100 and 5,100 employees at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We continue to adjust our SGA infrastructure to support our expected closings volume; however, we cannot make assurances that our actions will permit us to maintain or improve upon the current SGA expense as a percentage of revenues. It may become more difficult to reduce SGA expense as the size of our operations decreases. If revenues continue to decrease and we are unable to sufficiently adjust our SGA, future SGA expense as a percentage of revenues may increase further. Interest Incurred We capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during development and construction. During fiscal 2007, our inventory eligible for interest capitalization (active inventory) exceeded our debt levels; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt. However, due to our inventory reduction strategies, slowing or suspending land development in certain communities and limiting the construction of unsold homes, our active inventory has been lower than our debt level in recent quarters. As a result, we expensed $39.0 million of interest incurred during fiscal 2008. Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges, was 3.9% of total home and land/lot cost of sales in 2008, compared to 2.4% in 2007. The increase in the rate of interest amortized to cost of sales was primarily due to a greater decline in our home closings volume as 32 Table of Contents compared to the decline in our interest incurred during the year, and a more rapid reduction in our active inventory levels than our interest incurred over the time period in which fiscal 2008 closings were active versus the prior year closings. Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 22%, to $236.7 million, primarily due to a 23% decrease in our average homebuilding debt. Loss on Early Retirement of Debt In fiscal 2008, we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of $2.6 million, which was primarily due to the write off of unamortized fees associated with reducing the size of our revolving credit facility in June 2008. In fiscal 2007, in connection with the early retirement of our 8.5% senior notes due 2012, we recorded a loss of $12.1 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. Other Income Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $9.1 million in 2008, compared to $4.0 million in 2007. The increase in other income in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to an increase in interest income. Goodwill In performing our annual impairment analysis as of September 30, 2008, we estimated the fair value of our operating segments utilizing the expected present values of future cash flows. As a result of this analysis, we determined that the goodwill balance related to each operating segment in our Southwest reporting region was impaired. Consequently, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $79.4 million. As of September 30, 2008, our remaining goodwill balance was $15.9 million, all of which related to our South Central reporting segment. As of September 30, 2007, allocation of our remaining goodwill balance of $95.3 million was as follows: South Central $15.9 million and Southwest $79.4 million. The goodwill assessment procedures of SFAS No. 142 require us to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates, actual results could differ from such estimates. Income Taxes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we periodically assess the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the SFAS No. 109 more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods; reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; tax planning strategies; the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses; the duration of statutory carryforward periods; our historical experience in generating operating profits; and expectations for future profitability. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. SFAS No. 109 provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets. Due to the challenging market conditions in the homebuilding industry during the past two years, we have recorded significant impairment charges for both inventory and goodwill, and are in a three year cumulative pre tax loss position for fiscal years 2006 through 2008. While we have a long history of profitable 33 Table of Contents operations prior to the current downturn in the homebuilding industry, the expected cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, representing those deferred tax asset amounts for which ultimate realization is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible. The remaining deferred tax assets of $213.5 million for which there are no valuation allowances relate to amounts that are expected to be primarily realized through net operating loss carrybacks to tax year 2007. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. During fiscal 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, we sold a significant amount of land and lots through numerous transactions to generate cash flows, reduce our future carrying costs and land development obligations, and lower our inventory supply in certain markets to match our expectations of future demand. These transactions, combined with the results of all of our operations in this difficult housing environment, generated a net operating tax loss that can be carried back to fiscal 2006 and will result in a federal income tax refund. Consequently, we recorded a $676.2 million federal income tax receivable relating to the net operating loss carryback refund claim at September 30, 2008. On October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 had no impact on our beginning retained earnings. Effective with our adoption of FIN 48, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were previously included in interest expense and in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. During fiscal 2008, we recognized interest and penalties of $4.0 million in our consolidated statement of operations, and at September 30, 2008, our total accrued interest and penalties relating to unrecognized income tax benefits was $4.9 million. As of September 30, our total unrecognized income tax benefits were $18.7 million. All tax positions, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate. We do not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase within twelve months of the current reporting date. We are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining our fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and we are being audited by various states. The statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2004 through 2008. In fiscal 2008, the provision for income taxes was $1.8 million, which reflects the effect of the establishment of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. In fiscal 2007, the benefit from income taxes was $238.7 million, corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 differs from the statutory rate, primarily because of the establishment of the valuation allowance as discussed above. Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region East Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 46% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 44% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $332.5 million in 2008, compared to a loss of $66.1 million in 2007. The losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $288.4 million and $81.5 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included $42.7 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges of $39.4 million also contributed to the loss. A 34 Table of Contents decrease in the regions gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) of 930 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage declined in most of the regions markets, many of which have had very high sales cancellations resulting in unsold homes we aggressively priced to sell. Despite implementing significant cost control measures, our revenues declined at a greater rate (46%) than our SGA expense (29%), which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in this region. Midwest Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 51% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 46% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 7% decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $184.3 million in 2008, compared to a loss of $205.3 million in 2007. The losses were primarily due to a decline in revenues and inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $163.3 million and $167.3 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, while the regions home sales gross profit percentage remained relatively flat. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included $33.6 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges of $48.5 million also contributed to the loss. Despite implementing significant cost control measures, our revenues declined at a greater rate (51%) than our SGA expense (31%), which also contributed to the loss before income taxes in this region. Southeast Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 44% in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a 41% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 9% decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $507.7 million in 2008, compared to a loss of $131.6 million in 2007. The losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $457.5 million and $210.2 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included $116.7 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges of $11.5 million also contributed to the loss. A decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 990 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage declines in our Florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decreases. The Florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate, creating an environment that has shown not to be sustainable. The tightening in the mortgage environment, high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale by investors have led to increased inventory levels, requiring price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers, resulting in substantial gross profit declines. South Central Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 28% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a 29% decrease in the number of homes closed. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $9.0 million in 2008, compared to income before income taxes of $122.2 million in 2007. The loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $72.4 million in fiscal 2008, compared to $24.6 million in 2007. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included $29.1 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales. In addition, the regions home sales gross profit percentage decreased 130 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007. The decline in home sales gross profit was largely due to softening in the San Antonio market, where inventories of new and existing homes have increased, resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders. The majority of the regions inventory impairment charges were also in the San Antonio market. Southwest Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 38% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a 35% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as an 11% decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $366.7 million in 2008, compared to income before income taxes of $192.9 million in 2007. The loss in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $330.7 million, compared to $26.8 million in 2007. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included $155.4 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales. A decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 720 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007, which was largely due to declines in our Phoenix market, also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The Phoenix market experienced rapid price increases in previous years which encouraged speculation in residential real estate, creating an environment that has shown 35 Table of Contents not to be sustainable. The tightening in the mortgage environment, high cancellation rates and existing homes for sale by investors have led to increased inventory levels, requiring price reductions and increased levels of sales incentives to compete for the reduced pool of qualified buyers, resulting in substantial gross profit declines. The increased number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale in Phoenix has added further pressure to sales prices. In fiscal 2008, goodwill impairment charges of $79.4 million also contributed to the loss. West Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 45% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to a 36% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 17% decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $1.3 billion in 2008, compared to a loss of $932.1 million in 2007. The losses were primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $1.2 billion and $819.1 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our California and Las Vegas markets. In fiscal 2008, inventory impairment charges included $246.7 million of impairments related to fourth quarter land sales. In fiscal 2007, goodwill impairment charges of $374.7 million also contributed to the loss. A decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 920 basis points in 2008 compared to 2007 also contributed to the increase in loss before income taxes. Although all of the regions markets have experienced weak market conditions, the home sales gross profit percentage decline in our California and Las Vegas markets had the greatest impact on the overall decreases for the region. The California and Las Vegas markets experienced rapid, significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profits in 2006, but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers there. Credit tightening in the mortgage markets has also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by California and Las Vegas homebuyers in previous years. Increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions have been typical in these markets, as builders have attempted to increase demand for homes to reduce high inventory levels and to address affordability concerns, resulting in substantial gross profit declines. The increased number of foreclosed homes being offered for sale in California and Las Vegas has added further pressure to sales prices. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our homebuilding operations by reporting segment as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. Based on our revised operating segments and the operating divisions within those segments, we have restated the 2007 and 2006 amounts between reporting segments to conform to the 2008 presentation.

Factors that contributed to the slowing of demand included an increase in the supply of existing homes for sale, a reduction in investor purchases, an increase in incentives offered by homebuilders and sellers of existing homes, a decrease in the availability of mortgage financing for many potential homebuyers and a decline in homebuyer consumer confidence. In comparing fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006, the value of net sales orders decreased significantly in all six of our market regions. These decreases were primarily due to substantially similar decreases in the number of homes sold in each region, although in our Southeast, Southwest and West regions, a decline in average selling prices was also a significant factor. The most significant decline in net sales orders occurred in our West region, with 43% fewer homes sold in fiscal 2007 than in fiscal 2006. We believe that home sales in our California markets were negatively impacted, to a greater extent than our other markets, by a reduction in the pool of qualified buyers due to a lack of housing affordability and the decline of mortgage availability. The average price of our net sales orders in fiscal 2007 was $244,300, a decrease of 9% from the $267,300 average in fiscal 2006. The average price of our net sales orders decreased significantly in our Southeast, Southwest and West regions, due primarily to price reductions and increased incentives in our Florida, Arizona and California markets. In general, our pricing is dependent on the demand for our homes, and declines in our average selling prices during the year were due in large part to increases in the use of price reductions and sales incentives. Further, as the inventory of existing homes for sale continued to rise, it led to the need to ensure that our pricing was competitive with comparable existing home sales prices. As part of our efforts to keep our core product offerings affordable for our target customer base, adjustments to our product and geographic mix and pricing within our homebuilding markets also contributed to decreases in the average selling price. Our annual cancellation rate was 38% in fiscal 2007, compared to 28% in fiscal 2006. The higher overall cancellation rate for fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to cancellations in many of our Arizona, California and Florida markets. These elevated cancellation rates reflect the ongoing challenges in most homebuilding markets, including the inability of many prospective homebuyers to sell their existing homes, the increasing level of sales incentives and home price reductions in our markets continuing to erode buyer confidence and further credit tightening in the mortgage markets. The impact of the credit tightening became apparent in our cancellation rates in late fiscal 2007 as the mortgage products many buyers had selected were no longer available or they could not qualify due to stricter underwriting guidelines. 39 Table of Contents At September 30, 2007, the value of our backlog of sales orders was $2,694.4 million (10,442 homes), a decrease of 48% from $5,185.1 million (18,125 homes) at September 30, 2006. The average sales price of homes in backlog was $258,000 at September 30, 2007, down 10% from the $286,100 average at September 30, 2006. The value of our sales order backlog decreased significantly in all of our market regions. Home Sales Revenue and Gross Profit Revenues from home sales decreased 26%, to $10,721.2 million (41,370 homes closed) in 2007 from $14,545.4 million (53,099 homes closed) in 2006. Revenues from home sales decreased in all six of our market regions, led by the Midwest and West regions, with decreases of 41% and 36%, respectively. The number of homes closed in 2007 decreased 22% and the average selling price of those homes decreased 5%. These decreases were the result of slowing demand and the resulting decline in net sales order volume and pricing during fiscal 2007. Revenues from home sales in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were increased by $58.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from changes in profit deferred pursuant to SFAS No. 66. As of September 30, 2007, the balance of deferred profit was $32.6 million, compared to $90.6 million at September 30, 2006. The decline was attributable to both the drop in the number of homes closed and a decline in the availability of the mortgage types whose use generally resulted in the SFAS No. 66 profit deferral. Total homebuilding gross profit decreased by 82%, to $603.7 million in 2007 from $3,342.2 million in 2006. Including sales of both homes and land/lots, as well as impairment charges and land option cost write offs, total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased 1,720 basis points, to 5.4% in 2007 from 22.6% in 2006. Approximately 1,020 basis points of the decrease was due to the effect of inventory impairment charges and land option cost write offs. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, these were 12.0% in fiscal 2007 versus 1.8% in fiscal 2006. Gross profit from home sales decreased by 47%, to $1,848.9 million in 2007, from $3,497.6 million in 2006, and, as a percentage of home sales revenues, decreased 680 basis points, to 17.2%. The primary factor reducing our home sales gross profit margin was the difficult market conditions discussed above, which narrowed the range between our selling prices and costs of our homes in most of our markets, causing a decline of approximately 650 basis points in home sales gross profit as a percentage of home sales revenues. Due to declining sales in many of our markets, we offered a variety of incentives and price concessions, which affected our gross profit margin by reducing the selling price of the home or increasing the cost of the home without a proportional increase in the selling price. We also offered greater discounts and incentives to sell our inventory of homes, which was at a higher than desired level. This strategy helped reduce our total homes in inventory by approximately 8,600 units during fiscal 2007, but also contributed to a decline in our home sales gross profit. Additionally, our home sales gross margin decreased approximately 60 basis points due to an increase in the amortization of capitalized interest and 30 basis points due to an increase in warranty and construction defect expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. These decreases were partially offset by improvements in home sales gross margin of 20 basis points due primarily to an increase in the relative number of home closings in our more profitable markets, and 40 basis points resulting from the recognition of $58.0 million of previously deferred gross profit during 2007, compared to $1.6 million in 2006. During fiscal 2007, the difficult conditions within the homebuilding industry became more challenging. High inventory levels of both new and existing homes, elevated cancellation rates, low sales absorption rates, affordability issues and overall weak consumer confidence persisted throughout the year. The effects of these factors were further magnified by a decline in availability of mortgage products and higher mortgage interest rates on certain loan products, due to credit tightening in the mortgage markets. These factors, combined with our disappointing sales results, further declines in sales order prices and continued declines in gross profit from home sales revenues throughout the year, caused our outlook for the homebuilding industry and its impact on our business to become more cautious as the year progressed. During fiscal 2007, when we performed our quarterly inventory impairment analyses, the assumptions utilized incorporated our outlook, which reflected the expectation that the challenging conditions in the homebuilding industry would persist and have a greater impact than we believed when the year began. 40 Table of Contents Consequently, our strategy to reduce our inventory and lot position in a number of markets would likely take longer and require additional price concessions and incentives than previously anticipated. Therefore, our impairment evaluations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 indicated a significant number of projects with impairment indicators. Communities with a combined carrying value of $2,622.4 million as of September 30, 2007, had indicators of potential impairment and were evaluated for impairment. The analysis of each of these projects generally assumed that sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each project or for comparable projects in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate. While it is difficult to determine a timeframe for a given project in the current market conditions, we estimated the remaining lives of these projects to range from six months to in excess of ten years. Through these evaluations, we determined that projects with a carrying value of $940.5 million as of September 30, 2007, the largest portions of which were in the West and Southeast regions, were impaired. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded impairment charges totaling $278.3 million to reduce the carrying value of the impaired projects to their estimated fair value. These fourth quarter charges combined with impairment charges recorded earlier in the year resulted in total inventory impairment charges of $1,222.2 million during fiscal 2007. Approximately 74% of these impairment charges were recorded to residential land and lots and land held for development, and approximately 26% of these charges were recorded to residential construction in progress and finished homes in inventory. During fiscal 2006, we recorded impairment charges totaling $146.2 million related to projects with a carrying value of $459.3 million, the majority of which were in California. Of the remaining $1,681.9 million of projects with impairment indicators which were determined not to be impaired at September 30, 2007, the largest concentrations were in California (28%), Florida (20%), and Arizona (16%). During fiscal 2007 and 2006, we wrote off $107.3 million and $124.7 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs related to land option purchase contracts which we determined we would not pursue. The inventory impairment charges and write offs of earnest money deposits and pre acquisition costs reduced total homebuilding gross profit as a percentage of homebuilding revenues by approximately 1,200 basis points in fiscal 2007, compared to 180 basis points in fiscal 2006. Selling, General and Administrative (SGA) Expense SGA expense from homebuilding activities decreased by $315.1 million, or 22%, to $1,141.5 million in 2007 from $1,456.6 million in 2006. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SGA expense increased 40 basis points, to 10.3% in 2007 from 9.9% in 2006, due to a decrease in revenues. The largest component of our homebuilding SGA expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 59% and 64% of SGA costs in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Those costs decreased $260.2 million, or 28%, to $672.2 million in 2007 from $932.4 million in 2006, largely due to our efforts to align the number of employees to match our home closing levels, as well as a decrease in incentive compensation, which is primarily based on profitability. Our homebuilding operations employed approximately 5,100 and 7,100 employees at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining decrease in SGA expense of $54.9 million was primarily attributable to decreases in subdivision maintenance, advertising costs and professional consulting fees. Interest Incurred We capitalize homebuilding interest costs to inventory during development and construction. During both fiscal years, our active inventory exceeded our debt levels; therefore, we capitalized all interest from homebuilding debt. Interest amortized to cost of sales, excluding interest written off with inventory impairment charges, was 2.4% of total home and land/lot cost of sales in 2007, compared to 2.1% in 2006. Interest incurred is directly related to the average level of our homebuilding debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2007 with fiscal 2006, interest incurred related to homebuilding debt decreased by 6%, to $304.3 million, primarily due to a 5% decrease in our average homebuilding debt. 41 Table of Contents Loss on Early Retirement of Debt In fiscal 2007, in connection with the early retirement of our 8.5% senior notes due 2012, we recorded a loss of approximately $12.1 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees related to the redeemed notes. In fiscal 2006, in connection with the early retirement of our 9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our 10.5% senior subordinated notes due 2011, we recorded a loss of approximately $13.4 million for the call premium and the unamortized discount and fees, net of any unamortized premium related to these redeemed notes. Similarly, we recorded a loss of approximately $4.4 million related to the unamortized fees associated with the redemption and replacement of our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2006. Other Income Other income, net of other expenses, associated with homebuilding activities was $4.0 million in 2007, compared to $11.0 million in 2006. Major components of other income in both years were interest income and gain on the sale of assets, while in fiscal 2006, the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps was also a major component. Goodwill At June 30, 2007, we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary because of the significant amount of inventory tested for impairment under SFAS No. 144, the market conditions in the homebuilding industry and the decline in our stock price. We completed the first step of our goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2007, and concluded an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated for our East, Southeast and West reporting segments. As a result, during the quarter ended June 30, 2007, we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $425.6 million. During the quarter ended September 30, 2007, we completed the second step of our goodwill impairment analysis, through which we confirmed the appropriateness of our prior quarter write offs and determined that the goodwill balance related to our Midwest reporting segment was completely impaired. Consequently, the goodwill balance in our Midwest reporting segment of $48.5 million, which included $13.5 million transferred from the Southwest reporting segment due to changing our management structure, was written off in the fourth quarter. Total goodwill impairment charges for fiscal 2007 were $474.1 million. In addition, at September 30, 2007, we completed our annual impairment test and determined that the fair values of our South Central and Southwest reporting segments were greater than their carrying values and no impairment of goodwill existed in those segments. Our goodwill balances by reporting segment as of September 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows. Prior year amounts have been restated between reporting segments as appropriate, to conform to the 2008 presentation. September 30, Restated 2007 2006 (In millions) Goodwill: East $ $ 39.4 Midwest 48.5 Southeast 11.5 South Central 15.9 15.9 Southwest 79.4 88.9 West 374.7 $ 95.3 $ 578.9 42 Table of Contents Income Taxes In fiscal 2007, the benefit from income taxes was $238.7 million, corresponding to the loss before income taxes for the year. In fiscal 2006, the provision for income taxes was $753.8 million, corresponding to the income before income taxes for the year. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 25.1%, compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% in fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate during 2007 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2006, resulting in a reduced benefit from income taxes related to the loss in the year, because only approximately 23% of the $474.1 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2007 was deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the effective tax rate was 40.9% for fiscal 2007. Primarily as a result of recording significant inventory impairment charges during fiscal 2007, the balance of our deferred tax asset increased substantially, from $374.0 million at September 30, 2006 to $863.8 million at September 30, 2007. Homebuilding Results by Reporting Region East Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 22% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 22% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $66.1 million in 2007, compared to income of $112.9 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $81.5 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $39.4 million. A decrease in the regions gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) of 450 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage decline in our South Carolina and New Jersey markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease in the regions profitability. Midwest Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 42% decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a slight increase in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $205.3 million in 2007, compared to income of $111.3 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $167.3 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $48.5 million. The majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our Denver market. A decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 210 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006, as well as an increase in construction defect expense in Denver, also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. Southeast Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 28% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 24% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a 6% decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $131.6 million in 2007, compared to income of $346.4 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $210.2 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $11.5 million. A decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 1,140 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage decline in our Florida markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease. The Florida markets experienced rapid price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006. In 2007, high inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical throughout Florida, resulting in substantial gross profit declines. South Central Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 13% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to a 16% decrease in the number of homes closed, partially offset by a 5% increase in the average selling price of those homes. Income before income taxes for the region was $122.2 million in 2007, down 29% from 2006. Income before income taxes as a percentage of the regions revenues (operating margin) decreased 130 basis points, to 6.1%, from 7.4% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to 43 Table of Contents a decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 70 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006. The home sales gross profit change was largely due to softening in the San Antonio market, where inventories of new and existing homes increased, resulting in increased levels of sales incentives being offered by builders. The recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $24.6 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $2.2 million in 2006, also contributed to the decline in the regions profitability. Southwest Region Homebuilding revenues remained relatively flat, decreasing only 1% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 7% decrease in the average selling price of homes closed, partially offset by a 4% increase in the number of homes closed. Income before income taxes for the region was $192.9 million in 2007, down 54% from 2006. Operating margin decreased 1,160 basis points, to 10.2%, from 21.8% in 2006. The decrease in operating margin in 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 1,130 basis points in 2007 compared to 2006. The home sales gross profit change was largely due to declines in our Phoenix market. The Phoenix market experienced significant price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006. In 2007, higher inventory levels of new and existing homes and increased sales incentives and home price reductions were more common in Phoenix, resulting in gross profit declines. The recording of inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $26.8 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $4.8 million in 2006, also contributed to the decline in the regions profitability. West Region Homebuilding revenues decreased 34% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to a 34% decrease in the number of homes closed, as well as a slight decrease in the average selling price of those homes. The region reported a loss before income taxes of $932.1 million in 2007, compared to income of $720.6 million in 2006. The loss in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to inventory impairment charges and earnest money and pre acquisition cost write offs totaling $819.1 million, and goodwill impairment charges of $374.7 million. The majority of the inventory impairments relate to projects in our California and Las Vegas markets. A decrease in the regions home sales gross profit percentage of 790 basis points in 2007, compared to 2006 also contributed to the reduction in income before income taxes. The home sales gross profit percentage declines in our California and Las Vegas markets had the greatest impact on the overall decrease. The California and Las Vegas markets experienced rapid, significant home price increases in previous years which contributed to gross profit increases in 2005 and continued elevated gross profit in 2006, but these price increases also strained housing affordability for many potential homebuyers in those markets. Credit tightening in the mortgage markets also significantly limited the availability of many mortgage products used extensively by California and Las Vegas homebuyers in the previous years. In 2006 and 2007, inventory levels of new and existing homes in these markets were high and increased levels of sales incentives and home price reductions were typical in new home communities, as builders attempted to increase demand for homes and address affordability concerns, resulting in gross profit declines. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations Financial Services Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2008 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising DHI Mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2008 2007 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

Total first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for our homebuyers decreased by 41% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, corresponding to 45 Table of Contents the decrease in the number of homes closed of 36%. The percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which DHI Mortgage handled the homebuyers financing), to 61% in 2008, from 66% in 2007, as DHI Mortgage reduced the number of homebuilding markets it supports. Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 92% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2008, compared to 95% in 2007, reflecting DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. The number of loans sold to third party investors decreased by 50% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated. Consistent with the second half of fiscal 2007, originations during fiscal 2008 continued to be predominantly traditional conforming, conventional loans and FHA or VA insured loans. Financial Services Revenues and Expenses Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 39%, to $127.5 million in 2008 from $207.7 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold, although during fiscal 2008, the effect of decreased loan volume was partially offset by the recognition of an additional $8.8 million of revenues related to the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109, Written Loan Commitments Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings (SAB 109) on January 1, 2008. SAB 109 requires that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Additionally, we increased our loan loss reserve from $24.6 million at September 30, 2007, to $30.5 million at September 30, 2008 to provide for estimated losses predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale. Charges related to recourse obligations declined to $21.9 million in fiscal 2008 from $26.0 million in fiscal 2007. Recourse expense is included as a component of gains from sale of mortgages. General and administrative (GA) expense associated with financial services decreased 35%, to $100.1 million in 2008 from $153.8 million in 2007. The largest component of our financial services GA expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 71% and 75% of GA costs in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Those costs decreased 38%, to $70.8 million in 2008 from $114.9 million in 2007, as we have continued to align the number of employees with current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels. Our financial services operations employed approximately 700 and 1,100 employees at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a percentage of financial services revenues, GA expense increased by 450 basis points, to 78.5% in 2008, from 74.0% in 2007. The increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2008, and was partially offset by the effect of the additional revenue recognized upon adopting SAB 109 in fiscal 2008. Fluctuations in financial services GA expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned, as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume. Interest expense is directly related to the average level of our financial services debt outstanding during the period. Comparing fiscal 2008 with fiscal 2007, interest expense related to financial services debt decreased by 84%, to $3.7 million, primarily due to an 87% decrease in our average financial services debt. Interest and other income decreased 70%, to $11.4 million in 2008 from $38.5 million in 2007, primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations. 46 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2006 The following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006: Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2007 2006 % Change Number of first lien loans originated or brokered by DHI Mortgage for D.R.

The percentage decrease in loans originated was greater than the percentage decrease in homes closed due to a decline in our mortgage capture rate to 66% in 2007, from 68% in 2006. Home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted 95% of DHI Mortgage loan originations in 2007, compared to 94% in 47 Table of Contents 2006, reflecting DHI Mortgages continued focus on supporting the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations. The number of loans sold to third party investors decreased by 29% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated. During fiscal 2007, the market for certain non traditional mortgage loans changed substantially, resulting in the reduced availability of some loan products that had previously been available to borrowers. The affected loan products were generally characterized by high combined loan to value ratios in combination with less required documentation than traditional mortgage loans. Such loans constituted approximately half of our total originations during fiscal 2006, but these products declined substantially as a percentage of total originations during fiscal 2007, primarily in the third and fourth quarters. As a percentage of total loans originated, originations of traditional conforming, conventional loans and FHA or VA insured loans increased significantly during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, to approximately 90%, corresponding to the reduction in non traditional mortgage loans. Financial Services Revenues and Expenses Revenues from the financial services segment decreased 29%, to $207.7 million in 2007 from $290.8 million in 2006. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the number of mortgage loans originated and sold. Additionally, we increased our loan loss reserve from $15.6 million at September 30, 2006, to $24.6 million at September 30, 2007 to provide for estimated losses predominantly on loans held in portfolio and loans held for sale. The increase in this reserve resulted in a corresponding decrease to the gains on sale of mortgages, and reflects the market conditions related to non traditional products as described above, as well as potential repurchase obligations that exist on certain loans previously sold. GA expense associated with financial services decreased 24%, to $153.8 million in 2007 from $202.2 million in 2006. The largest component of our financial services GA expense is employee compensation and related costs, which represented 75% and 77% of GA costs in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Those costs decreased 26%, to $114.9 million in 2007 from $155.4 million in 2006, as we aligned the number of employees with the then current and anticipated loan origination and title service levels. Our financial services operations employed approximately 1,100 and 1,700 employees at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As a percentage of financial services revenues, GA expense increased by 450 basis points, to 74.0% in 2007, from 69.5% in 2006. The increase was primarily due to the reduction in revenue resulting from the decrease in mortgage loan volume during fiscal 2007 and an increase in loan loss expense discussed above. Fluctuations in financial services GA expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur due to changes in the amount of revenue earned, as some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume. Interest and other income decreased 32%, to $38.5 million in 2007 from $56.9 million in 2006, primarily due to the decreased volume of loan originations. Overview of Current Capital Resources and Liquidity We have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. As we have utilized our capital resources and liquidity to fund our operations, we have focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. At September 30, 2008, our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital was 43.6%, an increase of 340 basis points from 40.2% at September 30, 2007. Net homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital net of cash (homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity). The increase in our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital at September 30, 2008 as compared with the ratio a year earlier was primarily due to the decrease in retained earnings, which was partially offset by our higher cash balance and lower debt balance resulting from the generation of cash flows from operations. Our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital remains within 48 Table of Contents our target operating range of below 45%. We believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity position will allow us to be flexible in reacting to changing market conditions. However, future period end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the 43.6% ratio achieved at September 30, 2008. We believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing us with other homebuilders. We exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities. Because of its capital function, we include homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital. For comparison to our ratios of net homebuilding debt to capital above, at September 30, 2008 and 2007, our ratios of homebuilding debt to total capital, without netting cash balances, were 55.6% and 41.7%, respectively. We believe that we will be able to fund our short term working capital needs for our homebuilding and financial services operations and our fiscal 2009 debt maturities through existing cash resources and the cash flows from operations we expect to generate in fiscal 2009. Although we do not currently anticipate a need to borrow from our revolving credit facility in fiscal 2009, we are currently exploring alternatives with regard to the facility, which could potentially include an amendment to the current agreement. For the longer term, in addition to utilizing existing cash resources and cash flows generated from operations in the future, we expect to fund our operations through a renewed or amended credit facility and, if needed, the issuance of new securities through the public capital markets, subject to market conditions. Homebuilding Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents At September 30, 2008, we had available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion. Bank Credit Facility and Indentures We have a $1.65 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes a $1.0 billion letter of credit sub facility. The revolving credit facility, which matures on December 16, 2011, has an uncommitted accordion provision of $400 million which could be used to increase the size of the facility to $2.05 billion upon obtaining additional commitments from lenders. Our borrowing capacity, including the issuance of letters of credit, under this facility is reduced by the amount of letters of credit outstanding, and is currently further reduced by the limitations in effect under the borrowing base arrangement to $52.8 million, as more fully described below. The facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. Borrowings bear interest at rates based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread based upon our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement, our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted interest incurred and our senior unsecured debt rating. We may borrow funds through the revolving credit facility throughout the year to fund working capital requirements, and we repay such borrowings with cash generated from our operations and, in the past, from the issuance of public securities. At September 30, 2008, we had no cash borrowings and $71.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding on our homebuilding revolving credit facility and the interest rate was 5.5%. In addition to the stated interest rates, the revolving credit facility requires us to pay certain fees. In January 2008, through an amendment to the credit agreement, the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from $2.5 billion to $2.25 billion. The amendment also revised certain financial covenants, including reducing the required level of minimum tangible net worth and reducing the maximum leverage ratio. Additionally, the amendment modified the adjusted EBITDA to adjusted interest incurred covenant such that it can no longer result in an event of default. In June 2008, through an amendment to the credit agreement, the size of the revolving credit facility was reduced from $2.25 billion to $1.65 billion. The amendment further reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement and modified the leverage ratio calculation. In addition, the amendment increased the maximum residential land and lots to tangible net worth ratio and modified tangible net worth to include certain capital stock. The amendment also changed the pricing terms of our revolving credit facility, whereby the interest rate spread on borrowings and on unused committed capacity was increased. 49 Table of Contents Under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, if we have fewer than two investment grade senior unsecured debt ratings from Moodys Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poors Ratings Services, we are subject to a borrowing base limitation and restrictions on unsold homes and residential land and lots. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008 both Standard Poors and Moodys downgraded our senior debt rating to below investment grade status; therefore, these additional limitations became effective and are currently in effect. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, our senior debt rating was downgraded by all three rating agencies, and on November 26, 2008, was further downgraded by Moodys and Standard Poors to their current levels as follows: Moodys (Ba3); Standard Poors (BB); and Fitch (BB+). Under the borrowing base limitation, the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed the lesser of (a) certain percentages of the acquisition cost of various categories of our unencumbered inventory or (b) certain percentages of the book value of various categories of our unencumbered inventory, cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2008, the borrowing base arrangement limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source, including the issuance of letters of credit, to $52.8 million. Reductions of outstanding debt will increase our capacity under the borrowing base, while reductions of inventory will generally decrease our borrowing base capacity. Consequently, to the extent our debt balance declines at a faster pace than further inventory reductions, we would expect our capacity to increase under the borrowing base. Based on our current cash balance and expectations for cash flows, we currently do not anticipate a need to borrow from our revolving credit facility in the near term; however, we are exploring alternatives with regard to this credit facility, which could potentially include an amendment to the current agreement. The revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities by requiring us to maintain certain levels of leverage, tangible net worth and components of inventory. If we do not maintain the requisite levels, we may not be able to pay dividends or available financing could be reduced or terminated. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt. Based on the terms of the credit agreement as amended in June 2008, the following table presents the revised levels required to maintain our compliance with the financial covenants associated with our revolving credit facility, and the levels achieved as of and for the period ended September 30, 2008. These covenants are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. They are required to be maintained by us and all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, Guarantor Subsidiaries), other than the financial services subsidiaries and certain inconsequential subsidiaries (collectively, Non Guarantor Subsidiaries). Level Achieved as of or for the 12 Month Required Period Ended Level September 30, 2008 Leverage Ratio (1) 0.55 to 1.0 or less 0.496 to 1.0 Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted Interest Incurred (2) 0.93 to 1.0 Minimum Tangible Net Worth (3) (in millions) $2,000.0 $2,631.2 Ratio of Unsold Homes to Homes Closed 40% or less 26% Ratio of Residential Land and Lots to Tangible Net Worth (4) less than 200% 111% (1) The Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing net notes payable (as calculated below) by total capitalization (as calculated below). 50 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2008 (In millions) Consolidated notes payable $ 3,748.4 Less: Non Guarantor Subsidiaries notes payable (203.5 ) D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries notes payable 3,544.9 Add: Non performance letters of credit 32.0 Less: Allowable cash and cash equivalents of D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries* (968.2 ) Net notes payable $ 2,608.7 Consolidated equity $ 2,834.3 Less: Non Guarantor Subsidiaries equity (187.2 ) D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries equity $ 2,647.1 Total capitalization $ 5,255.8 * Includes the average cash and cash equivalents of D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries in excess of $50 million during the quarter. (2) The Ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted Interest Incurred is calculated by dividing D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 (as calculated below) by D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries adjusted interest incurred for the same period (as calculated below). For the Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2008 (In millions) Consolidated loss before income taxes $ (2,631.8 ) Less: Non Guarantor Subsidiaries income before income taxes (28.1 ) D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries loss before income taxes (2,659.9 ) Add: D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries interest expensed and amortized to cost of sales 266.9 Add: D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries depreciation and amortization 49.2 Add: Guarantor Subsidiaries goodwill impairment 79.4 Add: D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries inventory impairments and land option cost write offs 2,484.5 Less: Consolidated interest income (22.3 ) Add: Non Guarantor Subsidiaries interest income 12.5 D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries adjusted EBITDA $ 210.3 51 Table of Contents For the Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2008 (In millions) Consolidated interest incurred $ 240.4 Less: Non Guarantor Subsidiaries interest incurred (3.7 ) D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries interest incurred 236.7 Less: Consolidated interest income (22.3 ) Add: Non Guarantor Subsidiaries interest income 12.5 D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries adjusted interest incurred $ 226.9 Although the terms of the amended credit agreement do not require a minimum level of interest coverage to create an event of default, because the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted Interest Incurred is less than 2.0 to 1.0, we are required to pay an additional pricing premium on any cash borrowings. If the ratio is less than 1.5 to 1.0 for two consecutive quarters we must maintain an adjusted Cash Flow to adjusted Interest Incurred ratio for the most recent twelve months of 1.5 to 1.0 or maintain borrowing capacity under our borrowing base limitation plus D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents of $500 million or more. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 is the first quarter our ratio of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted Interest Incurred has been below 1.5 to 1.0. Adjusted Cash Flow is calculated by adding D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which was $1,675.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008, plus adjusted interest incurred of $226.9 million as calculated above. Consequently, the adjusted Cash Flow to adjusted Interest Incurred ratio for the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 was 8.4 to 1.0. (3) Minimum Tangible Net Worth is calculated by deducting Guarantor Subsidiaries goodwill of $15.9 million from D.R. Horton, Inc. and Guarantor Subsidiaries equity of $2,647.7 million (as calculated above). The amendment in June 2008 decreased the required tangible net worth minimum to $2.0 billion. (4) The amendment in June 2008 modified the Ratio of Residential Land and Lots to Tangible Net Worth covenant to limit the net book value of land and lots from 150% to 200% of adjusted tangible net worth when the net book value of land and lots is equal to or less than $4.74 billion. Prior to June 20, 2008, our senior subordinated notes indenture contained restrictions that became operative if our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the indenture, for four fiscal quarters was not at least 2.0 to 1.0. If we failed to satisfy this ratio, we would have been precluded from making certain restricted payments, including dividends, and incurring additional debt other than certain refinancing indebtedness, purchase money indebtedness or other permitted indebtedness that were not dependent on this ratio, including $1 billion principal amount of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility at any time outstanding. In May 2008, we commenced an offer to exchange any and all of our outstanding 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 for an equal principal amount of new 9.75% senior notes due 2010. In conjunction with the exchange offer, we solicited consents to an amendment to the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes that would eliminate many of the restrictive covenants applicable to the senior subordinated notes as described above. For each $1,000 principal amount of senior subordinated notes tendered prior to the expiration of the consent solicitation on June 4, 2008, holders received a consent payment of $10. On June 20, 2008, the exchange offer and related solicitation of consents to amend the indenture closed, with $96.8 million principal amount of the senior subordinated notes having been tendered for exchange, and $16.7 million principal amount of the 9.75% senior subordinated notes remaining under the amended indenture. As a result of the amendment to the indenture, many of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture were eliminated, including the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio discussed above. At September 30, 2008, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants, limitations and restrictions that form a part of the bank revolving credit facility and the public debt obligations. However, the margin by which we have complied with the tangible net worth covenant of our revolving credit facility has 52 Table of Contents declined. If our operating results and inventory impairments continue at recent levels, our tangible net worth may decline below the minimum level required by the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2009. Consequently, we intend to seek an amendment to our revolving credit facility to modify the covenant provisions included in the credit facility before our tangible net worth declines below the minimum required level. The amendment may also include, among other things, a reduction in the commitment amount under the facility and price increases on borrowings and unused commitment amounts. We cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts or that the terms or amount of any revised financing will not have an adverse effect on us, our business, capital resources or financial results. Repayments of Public Unsecured Debt On December 1, 2007, we repaid the $215 million principal amount of our 7.5% senior notes which became due on that date. In February 2008, through an unsolicited transaction, we repurchased $36.5 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase price of $36.0 million, plus accrued interest. The gain of $0.5 million is included in homebuilding other income in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, through unsolicited transactions, we repurchased $35.3 million principal amount of our 8% senior notes due 2009 at their face value, plus accrued interest, and $1.40 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 for a purchase price of $1.36 million, plus accrued interest. In November 2008, through unsolicited transactions, we repurchased a total of $102.9 million principal amount of various issues of our senior notes due in 2009 and 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of $98.2 million. Shelf Registration Statements We have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. Also, at September 30, 2008, we had the capacity to issue approximately 22.5 million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement, to effect, in whole or in part, possible future business acquisitions. Financial Services Capital Resources Cash and Cash Equivalents At September 30, 2008, we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of $31.7 million. Mortgage Warehouse Loan Facility DHI Mortgage had a $540 million mortgage warehouse loan facility that matured March 28, 2008. This facility was not renewed upon maturity, but was replaced with the mortgage repurchase facility described below. Commercial Paper Conduit Facility DHI Mortgage had a $600 million commercial paper conduit facility (the CP conduit facility) with a maturity date of June 27, 2009. Effective April 1, 2008, the CP conduit facility was voluntarily terminated by agreement of the parties. Mortgage Repurchase Facility On March 28, 2008, DHI Mortgage entered into a mortgage sale and repurchase agreement (the mortgage repurchase facility), that matures March 26, 2009. The mortgage repurchase facility, which replaced the mortgage warehouse loan facility, provides financing and liquidity to DHI Mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which DHI Mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming purchased loans. DHI Mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third party investors in the secondary market or upon a specified time per the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. As of September 30, 2008, $333.7 million of mortgage loans held for sale were pledged under this repurchase arrangement. The mortgage repurchase facility is accounted for as a secured financing. The facility has a capacity of $275 million, subject to an accordion feature that could increase the total capacity to $500 million based on obtaining increased committed sums from existing counterparties, new commitments from prospective counterparties, or a combination of both. In addition, DHI Mortgage has the option to fund a 53 Table of Contents portion of its repurchase obligations in advance. As a result of advance fundings totaling $106.9 million, DHI Mortgage had an obligation of $203.5 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at September 30, 2008 at a 4.9% interest rate. The mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by either D.R. Horton, Inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. The facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiarys minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth, its minimum required net income and its minimum required liquidity. At September 30, 2008, our mortgage subsidiary was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility. However, the margin by which we have complied with the minimum required net income covenant of this facility has declined. If our financial services operating results continue at current levels, this calculation may decline below the required level before the expiration date of the facility. Consequently, we intend to seek an amendment to our mortgage repurchase facility to modify the covenant provisions included in the facility before then. We cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts or that the terms or amount of any revised financing will not have an adverse effect on us, our business, capital resources or financial results. In the past, we have been able to renew or extend our mortgage credit facilities on satisfactory terms prior to their maturities, and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments of the respective credit agreements during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. The recent volatility in the credit markets and losses sustained by many banks will likely make renewing this facility more challenging and more expensive. The liquidity of our financial services business depends upon our continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities. Operating Cash Flow Activities During the year ended September 30, 2008, net cash provided by our operating activities was $1.9 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion during the prior year. During fiscal 2008, we continued to limit our investments in inventory, as evidenced by a $2.1 billion decrease in owned inventory (excluding the impact of impairments and write offs) during the fiscal year, compared to a $737.6 million decrease in fiscal 2007. In light of the challenging market conditions, we have substantially slowed our purchases of land and lots and our development spending on land we own, and have restricted the number of homes under construction to better match our expected rate of home sales and closings. We plan to continue to restrict our number of homes under construction and significantly limit our development spending during fiscal 2009. Our ability to reduce our inventory levels is, however, heavily dependent upon our ability to close a sufficient number of homes during the year, which may prove difficult given the current market conditions. To the extent our inventory levels decrease at planned levels during fiscal 2009, we expect to generate net positive cash flows from operating activities, should all other factors remain constant; however, the amount of cash generated in the future may be less than in prior periods. Additionally, we expect the receipt of our federal income tax refund of $676.2 million to contribute to positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009. Another significant factor affecting our operating cash flows in fiscal 2008 was the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale of $171.4 million during the year. The decrease in mortgage loans held for sale was due to a decrease in the number of loans originated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. We expect to continue to use cash to fund an increase in mortgage loans held for sale in quarters when our homebuilding closings grow. However, in periods when home closings are flat or decline as compared to prior periods, or if our mortgage capture rate declines, the amounts of net cash used may be reduced or we may generate positive cash flows from reductions in the balances of mortgage loans held for sale as we did in fiscal 2008. Investing Cash Flow Activities In fiscal 2008 and 2007, cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment, primarily model home furniture and office equipment. Such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows, but were reduced in fiscal 2008 in light of the weaker market conditions. 54 Table of Contents Financing Cash Flow Activities The majority of our short term financing needs have been funded with cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. Long term financing needs of our homebuilding operations have been generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets. Our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our homebuilding revolving credit facility are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries. During fiscal 2008, our Board of Directors approved two quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share and two quarterly cash dividends of $0.075 per common share, the last of which was paid on August 28, 2008 to stockholders of record on August 18, 2008. Quarterly cash dividends of $0.15 per common share were paid in each quarter of fiscal 2007. On November 20, 2008, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.0375 per common share, payable on December 18, 2008, to stockholders of record on December 8, 2008. The declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our financial condition and general business conditions, as well as compliance with covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement. Changes in Capital Structure In November 2007, our Board of Directors extended its authorizations for the repurchase of up to $463.2 million of our common stock and the repurchase of debt securities of up to $500 million to November 30, 2008. Through unsolicited transactions during fiscal 2008, we repurchased $37.9 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior subordinated notes due 2010 and $35.3 million principal amount of our 8% senior notes due 2009, which reduced the remaining debt repurchase authorization to $426.8 million at September 30, 2008. Upon expiration of the November 2007 authorizations, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our common stock and the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities. The new authorizations are effective from December 1, 2008 to November 30, 2009. In fiscal 2008, our primary non operating uses of our available capital were the repayment of debt, and dividend payments. We expect the repayment of debt to remain a significant priority for the use of cash in fiscal 2009. We continue to evaluate our alternatives for future non operating uses of our available capital, including the amounts of planned debt repayments, dividend payments and maintenance of cash balances, based on market conditions and other circumstances, and within the constraints of our balance sheet leverage targets, our liquidity targets and the restrictions in our bank agreements. Contractual Cash Obligations, Commercial Commitments and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. Purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations. We expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from operations, renewed or amended credit facilities and, if needed, the issuance of new securities through the public capital markets, subject to market conditions. 55 Table of Contents Our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of September 30, 2008 are presented below: Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Homebuilding: Notes Payable (1) $ 4,460.3 $ 774.8 $ 1,134.6 $ 840.9 $ 1,710.0 Operating Leases 61.5 21.1 27.6 8.5 4.3 Purchase Obligations 48.0 32.0 16.0 Totals $ 4,569.8 $ 827.9 $ 1,178.2 $ 849.4 $ 1,714.3 Financial Services: Notes Payable (2) $ 213.5 $ 213.5 $ $ $ Operating Leases 4.9 2.3 2.6 Totals $ 218.4 $ 215.8 $ 2.6 $ $ (1) Homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our senior and senior subordinated notes, our revolving credit facility and our secured notes. The principal amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to be $0 through its maturity. (2) Financial services notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiarys repurchase facility. The interest obligation associated with this variable rate facility is based on its effective rate of 4.9% and principal balance outstanding at September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2008, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $71.6 million and surety bonds of $1.6 billion, issued by third parties, to secure performance under various contracts. We expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. When we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. We have no material third party guarantees. Our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II of this annual report on Form 10 K. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. Within the land and lot option purchase contracts in force at September 30, 2008, there were a limited number of contracts, representing only $48.0 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their obligations. We consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of $21.7 million related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. Additionally, pursuant to SFAS No. 49, Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements, we recorded $16.9 million of land inventory not owned related to some of our outstanding land and lot option purchase contracts. Further discussion of our land option contracts is provided in the Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory section that follows. 56 Table of Contents Land and Lot Position and Homes in Inventory The following is a summary of our land and lot position and homes in inventory at September 30, 2008 and 2007: September 30, 2008 2007 Lots Lots Controlled Controlled Lots Owned Under Lot Total Lots Owned Under Lot Total Developed Option and Land/Lots Homes Developed Option and Land/Lots Homes and Under Similar Owned and in and Under Similar Owned and in Development Contracts Controlled Inventory Development Contracts Controlled Inventory East 12,000 6,000 18,000 1,100 14,000 12,000 26,000 1,800 Midwest 8,000 1,000 9,000 1,100 10,000 3,000 13,000 1,900 Southeast 23,000 6,000 29,000 2,300 32,000 14,000 46,000 3,400 South Central 25,000 9,000 34,000 3,700 31,000 15,000 46,000 4,400 Southwest 6,000 1,000 7,000 1,900 38,000 8,000 46,000 3,100 West 25,000 3,000 28,000 2,300 42,000 11,000 53,000 5,300 99,000 26,000 125,000 12,400 167,000 63,000 230,000 19,900 79 % 21 % 100 % 73 % 27 % 100 % At September 30, 2008, we owned or controlled approximately 125,000 lots, 21% of which were lots under option or similar contracts, compared with approximately 230,000 lots at September 30, 2007. Our current strategy is to continue to reduce our owned and controlled lot position, in line with our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings, through the construction and sale of homes and sales of land and lots, along with critical evaluation of acquiring lots currently controlled under option or in opportunistically acquired new lot positions. At September 30, 2008, we controlled approximately 26,000 lots with a total remaining purchase price of approximately $732.3 million under land and lot option purchase contracts, with a total of $50.9 million in earnest money deposits. Our lots controlled included approximately 8,000 optioned lots with a remaining purchase price of approximately $247.9 million and secured by deposits totaling $23.4 million, for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the contract has not yet been terminated. Consequently, we have written off the deposits related to these contracts, resulting in a net earnest money deposit balance of $27.5 million at September 30, 2008. We had a total of approximately 12,400 homes in inventory, including approximately 1,500 model homes at September 30, 2008, compared to approximately 19,900 homes in inventory, including approximately 2,000 model homes at September 30, 2007. Of our total homes in inventory, approximately 6,900 and 10,600 were unsold at September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At September 30, 2008, approximately 3,100 of our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 1,100 homes had been completed for more than six months. At September 30, 2007, approximately 5,000 of our unsold homes were completed, of which approximately 1,100 homes had been completed for more than six months. Our strategy is to continue to restrict and adjust our total number of homes in inventory and our number of unsold homes in inventory during fiscal 2009 as necessary, to match our reduced expectations for future home sales and closings. In addition, we will continue our efforts to opportunistically sell excess land and lot positions in certain markets. Seasonality We have typically experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Before the current housing downturn, we generally had more homes under construction, closed more homes and had greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. This seasonal activity increased our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during the third and fourth fiscal quarters and increased our funding requirements for the mortgages we originated in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. As a result of seasonal activity, our results of 57 Table of Contents operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year. In contrast to our typical seasonal results, due to further deterioration of homebuilding market conditions during the last two years, we incurred consolidated operating losses in our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and in all quarters of fiscal 2008. These results were primarily due to recording significant inventory and goodwill impairment charges. Also, the increasingly challenging market conditions caused declines in sales volume, pricing and margins that mitigated our historical seasonal variations. Although we may experience our typical historical seasonal pattern in the future, given the current market conditions, we can make no assurances as to when or whether this pattern will recur. Inflation We and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs. In addition, higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. We attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. However, during periods of soft housing market conditions, we may not be able to offset our cost increases, particularly higher land costs, with higher selling prices. Forward Looking Statements Some of the statements contained in this report, as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the SEC, statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts, stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us, may be construed as forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements are based on managements beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. These forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate, believe, consider, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, objective, plan, predict, projection, seek, strategy, target or other words of similar meaning. Any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience, and the expectations derived from them may not be realized, due to risks, uncertainties and other factors. As a result, actual results may differ materially from the expectations or results we discuss in the forward looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to: the continuing downturn in the homebuilding industry, including further deterioration in industry or broader economic conditions; the downturn in homebuilding and the disruptions in the credit markets, which could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital; the reduction in availability of mortgage financing and the increase in mortgage interest rates; the limited success of our strategies in responding to adverse conditions in the industry; changes in general economic, real estate, construction and other business conditions; changes in the costs of owning a home; the effects of governmental regulations and environmental matters on our homebuilding operations; the effects of governmental regulation on our financial services operations; our substantial debt and our ability to comply with related debt covenants, restrictions and limitations; competitive conditions within our industry; our ability to effect any future growth strategies successfully; 58 Table of Contents our ability to realize our deferred income tax asset; and the uncertainties inherent in home warranty and construction defect claims matters. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. However, any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on Forms 10 K, 10 Q and 8 K should be consulted. Further discussion of these and other risk considerations is provided in Item 1A Risk Factors under Part I of this annual report on Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Policies General A comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of D.R. Horton, Inc. and subsidiaries is presented in Note A to the accompanying financial statements as of September 30, 2008 and 2007, and for the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under GAAP, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected. Basis of Presentation Our financial statements include the accounts of D.R. Horton, Inc. and all of its wholly owned, majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. We have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts, under the requirements of Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51 as amended (FIN 46R), issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). All significant intercompany accounts, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition We generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. In situations where the buyers financing is originated by DHI Mortgage, our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment as prescribed by SFAS No. 66, the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed. Also in accordance with SFAS No. 66, the recognition of land sales is deferred when the full accrual method criteria is not met. We include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash. When we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. We either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances. We recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. We transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers. Origination fees and direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses, respectively, along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans, when the loans are sold to third party investors. As required by SAB 109 issued by the SEC in November 2007, the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. SAB 109 was effective for us on January 1, 2008 and has been applied prospectively to commitments issued or modified after that date. We generally do not retain or service the mortgages that we originate but, rather, seek to sell 59 Table of Contents the mortgages and related servicing rights to third party investors. Interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at cost adjusted for changes in fair value after the date of designation of an effective accounting hedge, based on either sale commitments or current market quotes. Some loans are sold with limited recourse provisions. Based on historical experience and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a total loss reserve predominantly for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale. Unhedged loans, or those not in a designated accounting hedge, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined by either sales commitments or current market conditions. Inventories and Cost of Sales Inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. Applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to SGA expense as incurred. All indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel and division and region management, advertising and builders risk insurance are charged to SGA expense as incurred. Land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. We use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs. Cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. Any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the community. When a home is closed, we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. Each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we determine will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month. We compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. We monitor the accuracy of each months accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount previously accrued. Although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, historically, differences in amounts have not been significant. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, land inventory and related communities under development are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present. We generally review our inventory at the community level and the inventory within each community may be categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development. A particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. In certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type (e.g. single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels). In reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following: gross margins on homes closed in recent months; projected gross margins on homes sold but not closed; projected gross margins based on community budgets; trends in gross margins, average selling prices or cost of sales; sales absorption rates; and performance of other communities in nearby locations. 60 Table of Contents If indicators of impairment are present for a community, SFAS No. 144 requires an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are required to be recorded if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. These estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions: supply and availability of new and existing homes; location and desirability of our communities; variety of product types offered in the area; pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors; alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties; amount of land and lots we own or control in a particular market or sub market; and local economic and demographic trends. For those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. When an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. The inventory within each community is categorized as construction in progress and finished homes, residential land and lots developed and under development, and land held for development, based on the stage of production or plans for future development. We generally do not purchase land for resale. However, when we own land or communities under development that no longer fit into our development and construction plans and we determine that the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale, assuming the land held for sale criteria defined in SFAS No. 144 are met. We record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. In performing impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions, market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land and recent legitimate offers received. If the estimated fair value less cost to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair value less estimated costs to sell these homes. The key assumptions relating to the valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors, and are inherently uncertain. Due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates. Our quarterly assessments reflect managements estimates and we continue to monitor the fair value of held for sale assets through the disposition date. Land and Lot Option Purchase Contracts In the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to procure land or lots for the construction of homes. Under such option purchase contracts, we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms. Under the terms of the option purchase contracts, many of our option deposits are not refundable at our discretion. Option deposits and pre acquisition costs we incur related to our land and lot option purchase contracts are capitalized in accordance with SFAS No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real 61 Table of Contents Estate Projects, if all of the following conditions have been met: (1) the costs are directly identifiable with the specific property; (2) the costs would be capitalized if the property were already acquired; and (3) acquisition of the property is probable, meaning we are actively seeking and have the ability to acquire the property, and there is no indication that the property is not available for sale. We also consider the following when determining if the acquisition of the property is probable: (1) changes in market conditions subsequent to contracting for the purchase of the land; (2) current contract terms, including per lot price and required purchase dates; and (3) our current land position in the given market or sub market. Option deposits and capitalized pre acquisition costs are expensed to cost of sales when we believe it is probable that we will no longer acquire the land or lots under option and will not be able to recover these costs through other means. We also evaluate our land and lot option purchase contracts in accordance with the provisions of FIN 46R. FIN 46R provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities, which FIN 46R defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with voting rights disproportionate to their ownership interests, or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities. FIN 46R requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both, defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. Under the requirements of FIN 46R, certain of our option purchase contracts result in the creation of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option. In applying the provisions of FIN 46R, we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity. Based on this evaluation, if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract, the variable interest entity is consolidated. Since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to FIN 46R, we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners. When our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers, certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required. In most cases, the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities has been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing. In these cases, it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity. Creditors, if any, of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets acquired. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we test goodwill for potential impairment annually as of September 30 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable. In analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill, SFAS No. 142 prescribes a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units. The fair value is estimated primarily utilizing the present values of expected future cash flows. If the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. Warranty Costs We have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed. We estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one year and ten year warranty obligation periods. The one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor; the ten year period is for major construction defects. Our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. Actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual. 62 Table of Contents Insurance Claim Costs We have, and require the majority of the subcontractors we use to have, general liability insurance (including construction defect coverage) and workers compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. In some states where we believe it is too difficult or expensive for the subcontractors to obtain general liability insurance, we have waived our traditional subcontractor general liability insurance requirements to obtain lower bids from subcontractors. We self insure a portion of our overall risk, partially through the use of a captive insurance entity which issues a general liability policy to us, naming some subcontractors as additional insureds. We record expenses and liabilities related to the costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under our insurance policies and for any estimated costs of potential claims and lawsuits (including expected legal costs) in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies, based on an analysis of our historical claims, which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported. Projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build, claim settlement patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. Because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts, actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts. A 10% increase in the claim rate and the average cost per claim used to estimate the self insured accruals would result in an increase of approximately $70 million in our accrual, while a 10% decrease in the claim rate and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $25 million in our accrual. Income Taxes We calculate a provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, a reduction in the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, we periodically assess the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on the SFAS No. 109 more likely than not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the taxable income available in current statutory carryback periods; reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; tax planning strategies; the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses; the duration of statutory carryforward periods; our historical experience in generating operating profits; and expectations for future profitability. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. SFAS No. 109 provides that a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and also restricts the amount of reliance on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets. The accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. Differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. On October 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Effective with our adoption of FIN 48, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of the income tax provision. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were previously included in interest expense and in selling, general and administrative expense, respectively. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and 63 Table of Contents effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change. Stock based Compensation With the approval of our compensation committee, consisting of independent members of our Board of Directors, we from time to time issue to employees and directors options to purchase our common stock. The committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders. We typically grant approved options with exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of the option grant. The majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period. On October 1, 2005, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which requires that companies measure and recognize compensation expense at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements. We calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. In addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. The statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157 2, which partially defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 and it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. The statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 and determined that mortgage loans originated and held for sale after October 1, 2008 will be accounted for at fair value. While our interest rate risk management policies have not changed, the effect of this standard will alleviate the documentation requirements to account for these instruments as fair value accounting hedges and we will no longer defer the recognition of net origination costs and fees. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. The statement clarifies the accounting for noncontrolling interests and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary, including classification as a component of equity. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and earlier adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 160; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, (SFAS No. 141(R)). The statement replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial 64 Table of Contents statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. The statement amends and expands the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. It requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The principal impact of this statement will be to require us to expand the disclosure regarding our derivative instruments, and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The statement identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements for nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with GAAP. SFAS No. 162 will be effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60. The statement requires that an insurance entity recognize a claim liability prior to an event of default (insured event) when there is evidence that credit deterioration has occurred in an insured financial obligation. SFAS No. 163 also clarifies the application of SFAS No. 60 Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises to financial guarantee insurance contracts and expands disclosure requirements surrounding such contracts. SFAS No. 163 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 163; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When The Market For That Asset Is Not Active. The staff position clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements in a market that is not active. FSP 157 3 became effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued. We adopted this FSP as of September 30, 2008, and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operation or cash flows. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt. We monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt. For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for variable rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our cash flows related to our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance, repurchase or repay such debt. We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our mortgage loan origination services. We manage interest rate risk through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities (FMBS), Eurodollar Futures Contracts (EDFC) and put options on mortgage backed securities (MBS) and EDFC. Use of the term hedging instruments in the following discussion refers to these securities collectively, or in any combination. We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 65 Table of Contents Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria. Typically, the IRLCs have a duration of less than six months. Some IRLCs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments, while other IRLCs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors. The hedging instruments related to IRLCs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments, with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. Hedging instruments related to funded, uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges, with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings, along with changes in the value of the funded, uncommitted loans. The effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness, which for the years ended September 30, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was not significant, is recognized in current earnings. At September 30, 2008, hedging instruments to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted IRLCs totaled $623.3 million. Uncommitted IRLCs, the duration of which are generally less than six months, totaled approximately $193.5 million, and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately $80.7 million at September 30, 2008. At September 30, 2008, we did not have any designated accounting hedges, and the fair value of the hedging instruments and IRLCs at September 30, 2008 was an insignificant amount. We also purchase forward rate agreements (FRAs) and economic interest rate hedges as part of a program to potentially offer homebuyers a below market interest rate on their home financing. At September 30, 2008, these potential mortgage loan originations totaled approximately $79.8 million and were hedged with economic interest rate hedges of $1,068.9 million in EDFC put options and $34.3 million in MBS put options. Both the FRAs and economic interest rate hedges have various maturities not exceeding twelve months. These instruments are considered non designated derivatives and are accounted for at fair value with gains and losses recognized in current earnings. The gains and losses for the years ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 were not significant. The following table sets forth principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations as of September 30, 2008. The interest rates for our variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates in effect at September 30, 2008. Because the mortgage repurchase facility is effectively secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale which are typically sold within 60 days, its outstanding balance is included as a variable rate maturity in the most current period presented.

Horton, Inc. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of D.R. Horton, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) at September 30, 2008 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Fort Worth, Texas November 25, 2008 67 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of D.R.
