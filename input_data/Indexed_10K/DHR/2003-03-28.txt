ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents Overview Danaher Corporation designs, manufactures and markets industrial and consumer products with strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions in two business segments: Process/Environmental Controls and Tools and Components. The Process/Environmental Controls segment is a leading producer of environmental products, including water quality analytical instrumentation and leak detection systems for underground fuel storage tanks; retail petroleum automation products; compact professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; and motion, position, speed, temperature, pressure, level, flow, particulate and power reliability and quality control and safety devices. In its Tools and Components Segment, the Company is a leading producer and distributor of general purpose mechanics hand tools and automotive specialty tools, as well as of toolboxes and storage devices, diesel engine retarders, wheel service equipment, drill chucks, and hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries. Management believes that the Companys future sales growth will come from both core organic growth and acquisitions. The Company invests significant resources in its organic growth initiatives across its business units. Additionally, the Company has completed numerous acquisitions and expects new acquisitions to provide revenue growth in the future. During 2003, the Company expects its primary served markets to remain essentially flat, with the majority of its revenue growth coming from market share gains and geographic expansion. Results of Operations Summary Of Sales By Business Segment. 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands) Process/Environmental Controls $ 3,385,154 74.0 % $ 2,616,797 69.2 % $ 2,441,986 64.6 % Tools and Components 1,192,078 26.0 % 1,165,647 30.8 % 1,335,791 35.4 % $ 4,577,232 100.0 % $ 3,782,444 100.0 % $ 3,777,777 100.0 % PROCESS/ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS The Process/Environmental Controls segment is comprised of Hach Company, the Dr. Bruno Lange Group, Videojet Technologies, Fluke Corporation, Fluke Networks, Gilbarco, Veeder Root Company, the Danaher Industrial Controls Group, the Danaher Motion Group (including General Purpose Systems, Linear Motion Systems and the Specialty Motors Division), Gems Sensors, Danaher Power Solutions, QualiTROL Corporation, and the aerospace and defense businesses of Pacific Scientific and Kollmorgen Corporation. These companies produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; retail petroleum automation products; underground storage tank leak detection systems; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; communication line products; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; quality assurance products and systems; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 29% in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisitions in February 2002 of Gilbarco and Videojet Technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36% increase in segment sales. This increase was offset by an 8% unit volume decline in existing businesses. A favorable currency translation impact provided a 1% revenue increase, and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001. Revenues from the Companys environmental business, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue, increased over 90% in 2002 compared to 2001, resulting primarily from the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Viridor in February 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001. Acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth, as core operations declined approximately 2%. Modest growth in the Companys water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation, brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets, and in Veeder Roots leak detection market. The Company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oil producing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the Gilbarco/Veeder Root business in 2002. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, grew 6% during 2002, also due to acquisition activity. Acquisitions contributed 11% of this growth, which was offset by a core volume decline of 5%, resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, declined 3%, as a core volume decline of 9% was offset by acquisition growth of 6%. Continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motions core volume decline. 11 Table of Contents Aerospace and defense revenues increased 7% in 2002, resulting from acquisition activity of 5% and core volume growth of 2%. Power quality sales declined 28% in 2002, due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002. Sales of the Companys industrial controls product lines fell 7% due to recession related weakness in their served end markets. In February 2002, the Company established its product identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies, which accounted for approximately 11% of the segments growth during 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.0% in 2002 compared to 14.9% in 2001. Excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001, margins decreased 0.7 points from 16.5% in 2001 to 15.8% in 2002. Approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002. Additionally, margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above, and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment, were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Sales in 2001 were 7% higher than in 2000 for this segment. The full year impact of the 2000 acquisitions of American Precision Industries, Kollmorgen Corporation, Warner Electric Motion and acquisitions of several smaller businesses in 2001 provided a 15% increase from 2000. Two small product line dispositions in 2001 caused a 2% decrease in 2001 segment sales. The remainder of the sales change was generated by a decrease in unit volume of 5% and a 1% negative currency translation impact. Overall segment prices remained flat for 2001 compared to 2000. Revenues from the motion business grew approximately 20% from 2000 levels. An increase of 40% from acquisitions was offset by declines in revenues from existing businesses of approximately 20%, driven by recession related weakness in end markets, particularly semiconductor end markets. Electronic test revenues declined 1.5%. Acquisition growth of 3.5% and continued growth in sales of Fluke Networks business were offset by declines in sales of Fluke industrial products. Environmental revenues for 2001 increased 17% from 2000. 7% of this growth resulted from acquisitions, with the balance coming from core growth in the Veeder Root and water quality product lines. The Companys aerospace and defense business units grew 39% in 2001. Acquisition growth of 30%, in particular that provided by the full year impact of the Kollmorgen acquisition, accounted for most of the increase. Power quality revenues declined 14% in 2001, as net acquisition growth of 6% offset significant declines in end user demand. Operating profit margins, excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, increased from 15.7% to 16.5% due to aggressive cost reduction actions across all business units and continued margin improvements in recently acquired companies. TOOLS AND COMPONENTS The Tools and Components Segment is comprised of the Danaher Hand Tool Group (including the Special Markets, Asian Tools, Professional Tools and Matco Tools Divisions), Jacobs Chuck Manufacturing Company, Delta Consolidated Industries, Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Hennessy Industries, and the hardware and electrical apparatus lines of Joslyn Manufacturing Company. This segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by these companies include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom designed headed tools and components; hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries; and high quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 2% in 2002. The entirety of this growth represents core sales volume growth, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002, and price and currency impacts were negligible. Hand tool revenues, representing approximately 65% of segment sales, grew 2%, generated primarily by increases in the Matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains. Additionally, hand tool revenues in the Companys Asian channels grew, but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels. Sales of diesel engine retarders at the Jacobs Vehicle Systems business unit increased significantly, as OEM customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline. Diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in October 2002, and is expected to negatively impact engine retarder revenues during 2003. Increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the Delta and Jacobs Chuck business units. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2002 compared to 11.3% in 2001. Excluding the impact of the 2001 restructuring program from both 2002 and 2001, margins increased 1.6 points from 13.5% in 2001 to 15.1% in 2002. This increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels, the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. 12 Table of Contents 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 Sales declined 13% from 2000 to 2001. Continued weakness in the heavy duty truck market significantly impacted sales of diesel engine retarders, accounting for a 4% drop in segment revenues. Sharp declines in drill chuck sales combined with a fall in hand tool revenues to contribute a 6% reduction in segment sales from 2000. Sales in both the Joslyn hardware and electrical apparatus lines and the Delta Industries product lines reflected double digit declines from the sales levels achieved by those lines in 2000 due to recessionary pressures in the markets they serve. Price and currency impacts were negligible for this segment. Operating profit margins, excluding the effects of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, decreased from 14.2% to 13.5%. The unfavorable impact of lower production volumes was partially offset by aggressive cost reduction actions taken across all business units. GROSS PROFIT Gross profit margin for 2002 was 39.0%, an increase of 0.8 points compared to 38.2% in 2001. This increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units, in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses. Gross profit margin in 2001 was 38.2%, a 0.5% decrease compared to 38.7% achieved in 2000. Lower core volume and lower margins associated with businesses acquired in 2000 and 2001 drove the reduction, and were partially offset by overhead cost reductions and process improvements in all business units. OPERATING EXPENSES In 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses were 23.8% of sales, an increase of 0.7 points from 2001 levels. This increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures, offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective January 1, 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 as a percentage of sales were 23.1%, 1 point lower than in 2000. Aggressive cost reductions and reductions in discretionary spending implemented in late 2000 and throughout 2001 drove this decrease. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $69.7 million ($43.5 million after tax, or $0.29 per share). During the fourth quarter of 2001, management determined that it would restructure certain of its product lines, principally its drill chuck, power quality and industrial controls divisions, to improve financial performance. The primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating, eliminating and or downsizing existing operating locations. No significant product lines have been discontinued. Severance costs for the termination of approximately 1,100 employees was estimated at $49 million. These employees include all classes of employees, including hourly direct, indirect salaried and management personnel, at the affected facilities. Approximately $16 million of the charge was to provide for impaired assets associated with the closure of 16 manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America and Europe. The assets impaired were principally equipment and leasehold improvements associated with the facilities to be closed. The remainder of the charge was for other exit costs including lease termination costs. Approximately $25.5 million of the $69.7 million charge related to the Tools and Components segments and approximately $44.2 million of the charge related to the Process/Environmental Controls segment. A table describing the application of the restructuring accrual is included in Note 3 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. The expected annual pre tax cost reduction, net of increased costs at other facilities, from the restructuring is approximately $38 million of which approximately 50% has been realized in 2002 with the full year benefit to be realized in 2003. These net cost reductions will primarily reduce the cost of goods sold in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. As of December 31, 2002, the restructuring program has been substantially completed as planned. While certain estimates are required in determining the net amount of cost savings achieved, based on the Companys analysis of the impact of the restructuring, management believes these net costs savings have been realized. Due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated, in December 2002, the Company adjusted its restructuring reserves accrued as part of the fourth quarter 2001 restructuring charge by approximately $6.3 million ($4.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share). In conjunction with the closing of the facilities, approximately $4 million of inventory was written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 as unusable in future operating locations. This inventory consisted principally of component parts and raw materials, which were either redundant to inventory at the 13 Table of Contents facilities being merged and or were not economically feasible to relocate since the inventory was purchased to operate on equipment and tooling which was not being relocated. The inventory write off was included in Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter of 2001 and was not part of the restructuring charge. INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS The Companys debt financing as of December 31, 2002 was composed primarily of $542 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 (LYONs), $315 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008. The Company maintains uncommitted lines and a revolving $500 million senior unsecured credit facility available for general corporate purposes. There have been no borrowings under the revolving credit facility since it was established in June 2001. Borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus .21% to .70%, depending on the Companys current debt rating. The credit facility has a fixed five year term. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Companys uncommitted lines of credit as of December 31, 2002. Net interest expense of $43.7 million in 2002 was $17.9 million higher than 2001. Returns on invested cash balances fell significantly, as general short term market interest rates declined substantially throughout 2002. Interest income of $10.3 million and $22.4 million was recognized in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net interest expense in 2001 was $3.5 million lower than in 2000 due to an increase in interest earned as a result of higher average invested cash balances during 2001. INCOME TAXES The 2002 effective tax rate of 34.0% is 3.5% lower than the 2001 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142 and its resulting cessation of goodwill amortization, and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a $30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement. This credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation. The 2001 effective tax rate of 37.5% is 0.5% lower than in 2000, driven primarily by a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2001 compared to 2000. INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Companys operations has been minimal in 2002, 2001 and 2000. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2002, the market value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt would decrease by $15 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Companys results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the 6% notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes will be the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders equity. See Note 7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. The Companys issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides an offset to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. 14 Table of Contents Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing the capital structure on a short and long term basis. Being a key source of the Companys liquidity, operating cash flow grew $101.9 million to $710.3 million in 2002, or 16.7% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The increase in operating cash flow in 2002 over 2001 was primarily the result of higher earnings and improved working capital management. Improvements were achieved in each working capital component during 2002, driven by Danaher Business System efforts to improve asset turnover. Gross capital spending of $65.4 million for 2002 decreased $19.0 million from 2001, as increased capital spending from new acquisitions was more than offset by declines in core businesses. Capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery, equipment and the improvement of facilities. In 2003, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $100 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded $26.5 million of cash proceeds for 2002, primarily due to the sale of six facilities in 2002. A net after tax gain of $3.9 million, approximately $.02 per share, was recorded on the facility sales and is included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company also measures its free cash flow. Free cash flow for 2002, which is defined as operating cash flow of $710 million less capital expenditures of $65 million, grew to a record $645 million, an increase of 23% from 2001. Free cash flow for 2001 is defined as operating cash flow of $608 million less capital expenditures of $84 million. Free cash flow provides a measurement of the cash flows from operations available for purposes other than ongoing capital expenditures. Investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002, used cash of $1,145 million compared to $488 million of cash used in 2001. As discussed below, the Company has completed numerous acquisitions of existing businesses during the year ended December 31, 2002 as well as the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. All of the acquisitions during this time period have been accounted for as purchases and have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these targets reflect the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the targets and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these targets bring to existing operations. On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at closing and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired 8 smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $166 million in cash including transaction costs. On January 2, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of United Power Corporation for approximately $108 million in cash including transaction costs. The Company acquired 11 smaller companies during 2001 for total cash consideration of approximately $343 million including transaction costs. The Company also disposed of two small product lines during 2001, yielding cash proceeds of approximately $33 million. On July 3, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of the motion businesses of Warner Electric Corporation for approximately $147 million cash including transaction costs. On June 20, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Kollmorgen Corporation for approximately $267 million cash including transaction costs. The Company also assumed debt with a fair market value of approximately $95 million in connection with this acquisition. On March 27, 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of American Precision Industries for approximately $186 million cash including transaction costs. The Company also assumed debt with a fair market value of approximately $60 million in connection with this acquisition. The Company acquired 5 smaller companies during 2000 for total cash 15 Table of Contents consideration of approximately $109 million including transaction costs. Financing activities generated cash of $516 million in 2002 compared to $410 million in 2001. In March 2002, the Company completed the issuance of 6.9 million shares of the Companys common stock. Proceeds of the common stock issuance, net of the related expenses, were approximately $467 million. The Company has used the proceeds to repay approximately $230 million of short term borrowings incurred in the first quarter of 2002 related to the Videojet, Gilbarco and Viridor acquisitions. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in zero coupon convertible senior notes due 2021 known as Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONS. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 7.2676 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 6.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time on or after January 22, 2004. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2004 or on January 22, 2011. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. Total debt under the Companys borrowing facilities increased to $1,310.0 million at December 31, 2002, compared to $1,191.7 million at December 31, 2001. This increase was due primarily to the change in the U.S dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting impact on the Companys Euro denominated debt as well as the effect of assumed debt obligations related to 2002 acquisitions. As discussed previously, as of December 31, 2002, $315 million of the Companys debt was fixed at a rate of 6.25%, $250 million was fixed at an average interest cost of 6% (subject to the interest rate swaps described above) and the Companys LYONs obligations (which as of December 31, 2002 amounted to $542 million) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%(with contingent interest payable as described above). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had unutilized commitments under its revolving credit facility of $500 million. As of December 31, 2002, the Company held $810 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. None of the Companys debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the Company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the Companys debt rating. In addition, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company could issue up to approximately $500 million of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the Companys 6% notes due 2008 having a notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of the notes will be the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. Since these instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges, they will have no impact on net income or stockholders equity. Due to declines in the equity markets, the fair value of the Companys pension fund assets has decreased since 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002. This adjustment results in a direct charge to stockholders equity and does not impact net income, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For 2003, the Company anticipates lowering the expected long term rate of return assumption from 9% to 8.5% for the Companys defined benefit pension plans. The Company anticipates there will be no funding requirements for the defined benefit plans in 2003. In the third and fourth quarters of 2001, the Company repurchased 375,500 shares of its common stock at a cost of $17.3 million. In the first quarter of 2000, the Company repurchased 2,042,300 shares of the Companys common stock for total consideration of $82.2 million. The ongoing costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Companys cash flows or financial position. 16 Table of Contents The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, and to pay interest and service debt. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company intends to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under its credit facility or under uncommitted lines of credit. The Company believes that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables summarize, as of December 31, 2002, and by period due or expiration of commitment, certain of the Companys contractual obligations and other commercial commitments. Payments due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 13 Years 45 Years Over 5 Years (in thousands) Long term debt (a) $ 1,309,964 $ 112,542 $ 385,949 $ 5,792 $ 805,681 Non cancelable operating leases (b) 261,000 54,000 78,000 56,000 73,000 Total $ 1,570,964 $ 166,542 $ 463,949 $ 61,792 $ 878,681 (a) As described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (b) As described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Other Commercial Commitments Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 13 Years 45 Years Over 5 Years (in thousands) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 58,000 $ 51,000 $ 7,000 Guarantees 102,000 100,000 2,000 Contingent Purchase Consideration 60,000 10,000 10,000 40,000 Standby Repurchase Obligations 2,000 1,000 1,000 Total Commercial Commitments $ 222,000 $ 152,000 $ 20,000 $ 10,000 $ 40,000 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. In general these commitments do not extend for more than a few months. Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Companys Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $93 million, $92 million and $70 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities a replacement of SFAS No. 125. A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions. In connection with the Companys acquisition of Thomson, the Company has entered into agreements to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. Aside from the sale of accounts receivable described above, the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Thomson, the leases included in the table above, and certain performance bonds and guarantees included in the table above, the Company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2002. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2002. 17 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, pensions and other post retirement benefits, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventory. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required. Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the new accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. Management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units. Long lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, relying on a number of factors including operating results, budgets, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company assesses and formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. This process begins during the due diligence process and is concluded within twelve months of the acquisition. The Company accrues estimates for certain costs, related primarily to personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings, anticipated at the date of acquisition, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. Costs incurred in excess of the recorded accruals are expensed as incurred. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations. This statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. The Company has followed the requirements of this statement for business acquisitions made after June 30, 2001. See Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment, measured on a reporting unit basis, could exist. The Company adopted the statement effective January 1, 2002. Danaher has nine reporting units closely aligned with the Companys strategic platforms and specialty 18 Table of Contents niche businesses. They are as follows: Tools, Motion, Electronic Test, Power Quality, Environmental, Aerospace and Defense, Industrial Controls, Level/Flow, and Product Identification. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the Company will no longer record goodwill amortization which amounted to approximately $55 million and $46 million, net of tax, in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Using the fair value measurement requirement, rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach, the Company recorded an impairment related to the Companys power quality business unit of $200 million ($173.8 million after tax), approximately 8.7% of intangible assets recorded as of January 1, 2002. The following table provides the comparable effects of adopting of SFAS No. 142 for the two years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. For the Years Ended December 31: 2001 2000 (in thousands except earning per share amounts) Reported Net Earnings $297,665 $324,213 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) 54,978 45,995 Adjusted Net Earnings $352,643 $370,208 Basic Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $2.07 $2.28 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .39 .32 Adjusted Net Earnings $2.46 $2.60 Diluted Net Earnings per Share 2001 2000 Reported Net Earnings $2.01 $2.23 Add back: Goodwill Amortization (net of tax) .36 .31 Adjusted Net Earnings $2.37 $2.54 In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not believe that implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No. 121. Though it retains the basic requirements of SFAS No. 121 regarding when and how to measure an impairment loss, SFAS No. 144 provides additional implementation guidance. SFAS No. 144 applies to long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of, including assets under capital leases of lessees; assets subject to operating leases of lessors; and prepaid assets. SFAS No. 144 also expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity, and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary. This statement was effective January 1, 2002. Implementation of this SFAS did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. In April 2002, the FASB approved SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of SFAS No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 rescinds previous accounting guidance, which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145, classification of debt extinguishment depends on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company does not expect this SFAS to have a material impact on its financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than at the date of the entitys commitment to an exit plan. This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are 19 Table of Contents initiated after December 31, 2002. Since adoption of this SFAS is prospective, the Company does not believe that the implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its financial statements. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148 (FAS 148), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure which amends FASB No. 123 (FAS 123), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. FAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The transition guidance and disclosure provisions of FAS 148 will be effective for the Companys financial statements issued for the first quarter of 2003. As allowed by FAS 123, the Company follows the disclosure requirements of FAS 123, but continues to account for its employee stock option plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value. Therefore, at this time, adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires a guarantor to make additional disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements regarding the guarantors obligations. In additions, FIN 45 requires, under certain circumstances, that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of the guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken when issuing the guarantee. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. ITEM 7A.
