ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW Danaher Corporation derives its revenue from the design, manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions, in two business segments: Process/Environmental Controls and Tools and Components. As discussed in greater detail below, subsequent to December 31, 2003 the Company acquired Radiometer A/S and substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the Gendex business of Dentsply International, Inc., adding medical technology products to the Process/Environmental Controls segment for 2004. These businesses, the core of a new Medical Technology platform, are expected to provide additional revenue and earnings growth opportunities for the Company both through growth of the existing businesses and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. The Company strives to create shareholder value through delivering revenue growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services; upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer 11 companies; and upper quartile cash flow generation from operations. To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the Danaher Business System (DBS), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company will also acquire other businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic platform. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the Companys overall growth and operating results. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors. However, Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. For the majority of 2003, market indicators of the global manufacturing economy remained mixed. While differences exist among the Companys businesses, the Companys markets strengthened in the second half of 2003 and the Company experienced strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 when compared against the fourth quarter of 2002. Given order and revenue trends in December 2003, January and February 2004, we expect the higher level of revenues experienced in the fourth quarter of 2003, adjusted for the seasonality of certain of our businesses, to continue into the early part of the 2004 fiscal year. Consolidated revenues for 2003 increased approximately 15.5% over 2002. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 10% growth, favorable currency translation, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, contributed approximately 4% growth and revenues from existing businesses for the year (defined as businesses that have been part of the Company for each comparable period reported excluding currency effect) contributed 1.5% growth. Substantially all of this sales growth from existing businesses occurred in the fourth quarter as the Companys revenues from existing businesses for the first three quarters of 2003 were generally consistent with 2002s comparable revenues. The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most of the markets and geographies served. The Company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. With the formation of the Medical Technology platform noted above, the Company expects to devote significant attention to the successful integration of these acquired businesses into the organization. Management believes it has the resources to successfully integrate these businesses into the Company. In addition, as noted above the Company benefited from the impact of favorable currency trends in its international businesses in 2003. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenue and profit in the consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the past three years: (in thousands) 2003 2002 2001 Process/Environmental Controls $ 4,096,686 77.4 % $ 3,385,154 74.0 % $ 2,616,797 69.2 % Tools and Components 1,197,190 22.6 % 1,192,078 26.0 % 1,165,647 30.8 % $ 5,293,876 100.0 % $ 4,577,232 100.0 % $ 3,782,444 100.0 % PROCESS/ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS The Process/Environmental Controls segment is comprised of businesses which produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools; product identification equipment and consumables; water quality instrumentation and consumables; retail petroleum automation products; underground storage tank leak detection systems; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; communication line products; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; quality assurance products and systems; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. Process/Environmental Controls Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 4,096.7 $ 3,385.2 $ 2,616.8 Operating profit $ 674.3 $ 540.5 $ 388.6 Operating profit as a % of sales 16.5 % 16.0 % 14.9 % 12 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Segment Overview Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 21% in 2003 compared to 2002. The fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Thomson Industries, and the 2003 acquisition of Willett International Limited (Willett), together with several other smaller acquisitions provided a 14% increase in segment sales. This increase was in addition to an approximate 5% favorable currency translation impact. Sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 2% compared to 2002, principally from sales increases in the motion, environmental and product identification businesses. Prices were essentially flat compared to 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.5% in 2003 compared to 16% in 2002. Operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by on going cost reductions associated with our DBS initiatives completed during 2003, and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses, which typically have higher cost structures than the Companys existing operations. Business Overview Environmental. Revenues from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue in 2003, increased approximately 15.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 accounted for approximately 7.5% growth, revenues from existing businesses provided 2% growth and favorable currency translation provided 6% growth. Operations were impacted by strength in the second half of 2003 in the Gilbarco Veeder Root retail petroleum equipment business, resulting in part from market share gains in the U.S. due to the addition of a number of distributors as a result of financial difficulties of a competitor. Increased sales to high volume retailers and strong year end purchasing activity from major oil companies with respect to both retail automation and environmental systems also contributed to the strength in the second half of 2003. Sales from existing businesses in the Companys water quality businesses also contributed to the increase as strength in laboratory instrumentation sales in Europe was partially offset by softness in the U.S. laboratory instrumentation and ultrapure markets due to continued weakness in the semiconductor and electrical assembly markets and due to several large contracts in 2002 not repeating in 2003. The US laboratory equipment markets showed strength in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared against the first three quarters of 2003. The business continues to focus on faster growing markets in developing countries such as China to enhance its growth prospects. Motion. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of 2003s segment revenues, grew 33%, as acquisitions provided growth of 21% (primarily from the Thomson Industries acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002) and favorable currency translation effects provided 8% growth to drive this increase. The existing businesses revenues accounted for 4% growth, reflecting share gains in certain of its end markets, including electric vehicles and direct drives, partially offset by year over year low single digit declines in the Companys linear actuator product businesses resulting from integration of the sales channels associated with the Thomson acquisition. The Companys linear actuator businesses showed low single digit growth in the fourth quarter representing the first quarter of growth for this business in 2003, reflecting increased shipments for military programs as well as increased sales to the Companys distribution network. Electronic Test. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 16% of 2003s segment revenues, grew 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions, principally the Raytek Corporation acquisition, completed in August 2002, provided 9% growth, which includes strong sales of Rayteks non contact temperature measurement and thermal imaging products. Favorable currency translation provided 5% growth. These factors were partially offset by an approximate 1% decline in sales from existing businesses due primarily to continued softness in telecommunications and data network markets. The Companys network test business strengthened in the second half of 2003, compared to the first half of 2003, to post low single digit declines for the year. Product Identification. In February 2002, the Company established its Product Identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies. In January 2003 Willett was added to this business and Accu Sort Systems, Inc. was acquired in November 2003. The Product Identification business accounted for approximately 12% of segment revenues in 2003. For 2003, Product Identification revenues grew 65% compared to 2002, with the Willett and Accu Sort acquisitions providing 55% growth, favorable currency impacts of approximately 5%, and existing operations providing 5% growth, based largely on broad based equipment sales increases. Focused Niche Businesses. The segments niche businesses in the aggregate showed high single digit revenue growth in 2003, primarily from acquisitions in the Companys Aerospace and Defense and Industrial Controls businesses. 13 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Segment Overview Sales of the Process/Environmental Controls segment increased 29% in 2002 compared to 2001. The acquisitions in February 2002 of Gilbarco and Videojet Technologies as well as several smaller 2001 and 2002 acquisitions provided a 36% increase in segment sales. This increase was offset by an 8% unit volume decline in existing businesses. A favorable currency translation impact provided a 1% revenue increase, and prices were essentially flat compared to 2001. Operating profit margins for the segment were 16.0% in 2002 compared to 14.9% in 2001. Approximately 130 basis points of the change in operating margin resulted from the dilutive impact of lower operating margins of the new businesses acquired during 2001 and 2002. Additionally, margin declines from lower sales volumes at the business units described above, and increases in expenditures on growth opportunities in the segment, were offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. Business Overview Revenues from the Companys environmental business, representing approximately 30% of segment revenue, increased over 90% in 2002 compared to 2001, resulting primarily from the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Viridor in February 2002 and two smaller acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2001. Acquisitions provided the entirety of this growth, as revenues from existing businesses declined approximately 2%. Modest growth in the Companys water quality business units was offset by weakness in demand for ultrapure instrumentation, brought on primarily by weakness in semiconductor end markets, and in Veeder Roots leak detection market. The Company believes geopolitical uncertainties in oil producing regions contributed to the decline in demand in the end markets served by the Gilbarco/Veeder Root business in 2002. Electronic test revenues, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, grew 6% during 2002, also due to acquisition activity. Acquisitions contributed 11% of this growth, which was offset by a revenue decline from existing businesses of 5%, resulting from weakness in both industrial and network test equipment sales. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 20% of segment revenues, declined 3%, as a revenue decline from existing businesses of 9% was offset by acquisition growth of 6%. Continued softness in semiconductor and electronic assembly end market demand was a leading factor in motions revenue decline from existing businesses. Aerospace and defense revenues increased 7% in 2002, resulting from acquisition activity of 5% and revenue growth from existing businesses of 2%. Power quality sales declined 28% in 2002, due to a significant decline in end user demand that began in early 2001 and has continued through 2002. Sales of the Companys industrial controls product lines fell 7% due to recession related weakness in their served end markets. In February 2002, the Company established its product identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies, which accounted for approximately 11% of the segments growth during 2002. TOOLS AND COMPONENTS The Tools and Components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom designed headed tools and components; hardware and components for the power generation and transmission industries; and high quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts. Tools and Components Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 1,197.2 $ 1,192.1 $ 1,165.6 Operating profit $ 173.8 $ 181.4 $ 131.8 Operating profit as a % sales 14.5 % 15.2 % 11.3 % 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 0.4% in 2003. The entirety of this growth represents growth in sales volume from existing businesses, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2002 or 2003. Price and currency impacts on revenues were negligible. Mechanics Hand Tools revenues, representing approximately two thirds of segment sales in 2003, grew 14 approximately 3.5% for the year, driven primarily by increases in sales from the groups retail hand tool product lines which rebounded in the second half of 2003 as sales to the groups largest customer strengthened through the third and fourth quarters of 2003. In addition, both the Companys Matco and Asian distribution channels showed growth for 2003. Offsetting these increases was a net sales decline in the segments niche businesses, as continued weakness in shipments of truck and industrial boxes, drill chucks and pole line hardware driven by weak end markets and increased competition from low cost competitors was partially offset by revenue gains in the Companys wheel service equipment product lines. Also, sales of diesel engine retarders fell during 2003, reflecting decreased end user demand as compared to 2002. In 2002, the business experienced an inventory build up by customers in advance of regulatory changes implemented in 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.5% in 2003 compared to 15.2% in 2002. Operating profit margins in 2002 benefited by 10 basis points from the reversal of unutilized accruals established for the 2001 restructuring program. Margin improvements at the Jacobs Chuck business unit related to the 2001 restructuring program, and other cost reductions, were offset by margin declines at the Delta Industries business unit related to the volume decrease noted above, the impact of lower engine retarder sales, and by spending on certain cost reduction and growth opportunities. The Company believes operating profit margins will return to the levels experienced in 2002 as the impact of spending initiatives are expected to yield benefits in 2004. 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 Revenues in the Tools and Components segment grew 2% in 2002. The entirety of this growth represents sales volume growth from existing businesses, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during 2001 and 2002, and price and currency impacts were negligible. Mechanics Hand Tool revenues, representing approximately 65% of segment sales, grew 2%, generated primarily by increases in the Matco sales channel as a result of continued market share gains. Additionally, hand tool revenues in the Companys Asian channels grew, but were offset by declines in domestic retail channels. Sales of diesel engine retarders at the Jacobs Vehicle Systems business unit increased significantly, as OEM customers accelerated their 2002 order rates to meet a regulatory deadline. Diesel engine retarder demand declined sharply following passage of the regulatory deadline in October 2002. Increases in this segment in 2002 were offset by declines in the Delta and Jacobs Chuck business units. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2002 compared to 11.3% in 2001. This increase resulted from the effect of higher revenue levels, the cessation of goodwill amortization as of January 1, 2002, and other cost reductions including the partial benefit of the 2001 restructuring actions. GROSS PROFIT For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 $ 3,782.4 Cost of sales $ 3,154.8 $ 2,791.2 $ 2,338.0 Gross profit 2,139.1 1,786.0 1,444.4 Gross profit margin 40.4 % 39.0 % 38.2 % Gross profit margin for 2003 was 40.4%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to 39.0% in 2002. This increase results from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program, on going cost improvements in existing business units driven by our DBS processes, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired, cost reductions in business units acquired during the first quarter of 2002 and the leverage created from higher revenues during the year. The Companys restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 is estimated to have provided approximately $38 million of savings to the full year 2003 when compared against the 2001 period. This restructuring was complete at the beginning of 2003. Gross profit margins are expected to improve in 2004, reflecting ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the Companys DBS processes, continued cost savings from low cost region sourcing initiatives as well as the impact of higher margins from recent acquisitions. These improvements could be affected by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improving overall economy. Gross profit margin in 2002 was 39.0%, a 80 basis point increase compared to 38.2% achieved in 2001. This increase resulted from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program and other improvements in the gross margins of core business units, in addition to the effect of slightly higher gross margins of newly acquired businesses. 15 OPERATING EXPENSES For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Sales $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 $ 3,782.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 1,315.6 $ 1,091.2 $ 872.7 SG&A as a % of sales 24.9 % 23.8 % 23.1 % In 2003, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were 24.9% of sales, an increase of 110 basis points from 2002 levels. This increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. In addition, SG&A expenses in 2002 included approximately 20 basis points of benefit associated with gains from the sale of real estate recorded in 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 were 23.8% of sales, an increase of 70 basis points from 2001 levels. This increase is due primarily to the effect of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative cost structures, partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization effective January 1, 2002 and the gains on real estate sales mentioned above. GAIN ON PENSION PLAN CURTAILMENT The Company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates ongoing participation in its Cash Balance Plan effective December 31, 2003. The gain totaled $22.5 million ($14.6 million after tax, or $0.09 per share) and represents the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of our participating associates prior to freezing the plan. As discussed in more detail below, the Company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan, primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the above curtailment. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $69.7 million ($43.5 million after tax, or $0.29 per share) related to restructuring certain of its product lines, principally its drill chuck, power quality and industrial controls divisions, to improve financial performance. The primary objective of the restructuring plan was to reduce operating costs by consolidating, eliminating and or downsizing existing operating locations. No significant product lines were discontinued. A table describing the components of the restructuring accrual is included in Note 4 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. This restructuring is estimated to have provided annual pre tax cost reduction, net of increased costs at other facilities, of approximately $38 million of which approximately 50% was realized in 2002 with the full annual benefit realized in 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the restructuring program had been substantially completed as planned. Due to minor changes to the original restructuring plan and to costs incurred being less than estimated, in December 2002, the Company recorded a benefit related to adjusting its unutilized restructuring reserves by approximately $6.3 million ($4.1 million after tax, or $0.03 per share). INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities and Indebtedness below. Interest expense of $59 million in 2003 was approximately $5 million higher than the corresponding 2002 period. The increase in interest expense is due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the Companys $378 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 partially offset by reduced debt levels resulting from net repayments of approximately $146 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2003. Interest expense of approximately $54 million in 2002 was $6 million higher than 2001. Interest income of $10 million, $10 million, and $22 million was recognized in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Average invested cash balances have grown over the period from 2001 to 2003, but have been largely offset by lower average interest rates earned on these deposits. INCOME TAXES The 2003 effective tax rate of 32.6% is 1.4% lower than the 2002 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 and the impact of additional research and experimentation credits available to reduce the 16 U.S. tax liabilities. The Company expects to further reduce its effective tax rate for 2004 to 31.5% reflecting the continuing benefit of deriving an increasing proportion of the Companys earnings from international operations. In addition, the impact on the Companys effective tax rate resulting from the Radiometer acquisition completed in the first quarter of 2004 has not been fully analyzed but the addition of the Radiometer business, which is based in Denmark and has significant operations outside the United States, could further reduce the effective tax rate. The 2002 effective tax rate of 34.0% was 3.5% lower than the 2001 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of adopting SFAS No. 142 and the resulting cessation of goodwill amortization, and also due to a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In connection with the completion of a federal income tax audit, the Company adjusted certain income tax related reserves established related to the sale of a previously discontinued operation and recorded a $30 million credit to its fourth quarter 2002 income statement. This credit has been classified separately below net earnings from continuing operations since the tax reserves related to a previously discontinued operation. INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Companys operations has been minimal in 2003, 2002 and 2001. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. The fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2003, the market value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately $17 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Companys results of operations or financial conditions under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges. The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than 30 countries. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Companys issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, our interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to selling to a large number of customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. 17 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Total operating cash flows $ 861.5 $ 710.3 $ 608.5 Purchases of property, plant and equipment $ (80.3 ) $ (65.4 ) $ (84.5 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (312.3 ) (1,158.1 ) (439.8 ) Other sources 24.5 79.0 36.7 Net cash used in investing activities $ (368.1 ) $ (1,144.5 ) $ (487.6 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock $ 50.5 $ 512.1 $ 28.2 Proceeds (repayments) of borrowings, net (145.5 ) 17.7 410.5 Other uses (15.3 ) (13.5 ) (29.0 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (110.3 ) $ 516.3 $ 409.7 Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity, was $862 million for 2003, an increase of $151 million, or approximately 21% as compared to 2002. The increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by earnings growth as well as continued improvements in the Companys working capital management. As of December 31, 2003, the Company held approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, approximately $772 million (net of cash acquired) of which were used to fund the acquisitions completed subsequent to December 31, 2003 noted below. Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired twelve companies and product lines during 2003 for total consideration of approximately $312 million in cash, including transaction costs. Subsequent to December 31, 2003 and prior to the date of the Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company acquired three additional businesses for total consideration of approximately $772 million in cash (net of cash acquired), including transaction costs. Due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002, the fair value of the Companys pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan. After recording a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002, the Company increased the minimum pension liability to $114.1 million (net of tax benefit of $59.6 million) at December 31, 2003 as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions, including the impact of the plan curtailment noted above. While not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan for 2003, the Company contributed $10 million to the plan before December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2004. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long term basis. Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity, was $862 million for 2003, an increase of $151 million, or approximately 21% as compared to 2002. The increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by earnings growth as well as the impact of the timing of payments for certain of the Companys benefit programs, including 401(k) and employee health plan contributions. In addition, working capital improved in 2003 compared to 2002 but at a slower level than in 2002. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $368 million in 2003 compared to approximately $1.1 billion of net cash used in 2002. Gross capital spending of $80 million for 2003 increased $15 million from 2002, due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the Companys low cost region sourcing initiatives. Capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery, equipment and the improvement of facilities. Gross capital spending of $65 million for 2002 decreased $19 million from 2001, as increased capital spending from new acquisitions was more than offset by declines in core businesses. In 2004, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $100 million. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $13 million of cash proceeds for 2003, primarily due to the sale of four facilities and other real property. Disposals of fixed assets yielded $26 million of cash proceeds for 2002, primarily due to the sale of six facilities during the year. Net pre tax gains of $0.9 million and $6.0 million were recorded in 2003 and 2002, 18 respectively, on these sales and are included as a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of earnings. In addition, as discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions during 2003, 2002 and 2001. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10 K, the Company had also completed three acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2003. All of the acquisitions during this time period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these targets reflect the competitive nature of the process by which we acquired the targets and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these targets bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2003 Acquisitions The Company acquired twelve companies and product lines during 2003 for total consideration of approximately $312 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. The Company also assumed debt with an estimated fair market value of approximately $45 million in connection with these acquisitions. In connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions, the Company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $36.8 million in November 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through November 2008. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as Product Identification, Environmental and Aerospace and Defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Process/Controls segment. The aggregated annual revenue of the acquired businesses is approximately $361 million and each of these twelve companies individually has less than $125 million in annual revenues. In addition, the Company sold one facility acquired in connection with a prior acquisition for approximately $11.6 million in net proceeds. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale and the proceeds have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2002 Acquisitions On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next six years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired eight smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $186 million in net cash including transaction costs. 2001 Acquisitions On January 2, 2001, the Company acquired 100% of the assets of United Power Corporation for approximately $108 million in net cash including transaction costs. The Company acquired 11 smaller companies during 2001 for total net cash consideration of approximately $343 million including transaction costs. The Company also disposed of two small product lines during 2001, yielding cash proceeds of approximately $33 million. Recent Acquisition Developments On January 27, 2004, Danaher acquired 95.4% of the share capital of, and 97.9% of the voting rights in, Radiometer S/A for approximately $652 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including transaction costs, pursuant to a tender offer announced on December 11, 2003. In addition, Danaher assumed $65 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Danaher submitted a mandatory tender offer for the remaining outstanding shares of Radiometer on February 4, 2004 as required under Danish law and intends to effect a compulsory redemption of the remaining outstanding shares as permitted under Danish law. Once all of the Radiometer shares are acquired, it is expected that the total consideration for such shares, including transaction costs, will be approximately $687 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash). Radiometer has total annual revenues of approximately $300 million. In addition, on February 27, 2004, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the Gendex business of Dentsply International, Inc. for approximately $105 million in net cash, including transaction costs. Gendex has annual revenues of approximately $100 million. The Company also completed the acquisition of a small instrument company subsequent to December 31, 2003. The Company funded all three acquisitions from existing cash reserves. 19 Financing Activities and Indebtedness Financing activities used cash of $110 million during 2003 compared to $516 million generated during 2002. The primary reason for the difference was the Companys issuance of 6.9 million shares of the Companys common stock in March 2002. Proceeds of the common stock issuance, net of the related expenses, were approximately $467 million. The Company used the proceeds to repay approximately $230 million of short term borrowings incurred in the first quarter of 2002 related to the Videojet, Gilbarco and Viridor acquisitions noted above. The balance of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes. Total debt decreased to $1,298.8 million at December 31, 2003, compared to $1,310.0 million at December 31, 2002. This decrease was due primarily to net repayments of $146 million of debt, offset in part by the change in the U.S Dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting increase in the carrying value of the Companys Euro denominated debt. All significant debt obligations assumed related to 2003 acquisitions have been repaid. The Companys debt financing as of December 31, 2003 was composed primarily of $555 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONs (LYONs), $378 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described above). The Companys LYONs obligations (described in further detail below) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. The Company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $1 billion available for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus .21% to .70%, depending on the Companys debt rating. The credit facilities, each $500 million, have a fixed term expiring June 28, 2006 and July 23, 2006, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under either of the Companys credit facilities at any time during 2003. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt, and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 7.2676 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 6.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company. These notes were redeemed for cash and therefore this amount has been classified as a current liability in the accompanying financial statements. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. Cash and Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2003, the Company held approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less, approximately $772 million of which were used to fund the acquisitions completed subsequent to December 31, 2003 noted above. As of December 31, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. None of the Companys debt instruments contain trigger clauses requiring the Company to repurchase or pay off its debt if rating agencies downgrade the Companys debt rating. In addition, as of the date of this Form 10 K, the Company could issue up to $1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds. The Company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions consummated during 2004 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through borrowings under its credit facilities, under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets. Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities Due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002, the fair value of the Companys pension fund assets has decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment of $76.9 million (net of tax benefit of $39.6 million) at December 31, 2002. Based on changes in actuarial assumptions, including the impact of the plan curtailment noted above, the minimum pension liability was increased to $114.1 million (net of tax benefit of $59.6 million) as of December 31, 2003. The 20 minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of September 30, 2003 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 for additional information). This adjustment results in a direct charge to stockholders equity and does not immediately impact net earnings, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company used a 6.0% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2003, which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% from the rate used at December 31, 2002. A further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the after tax minimum pension liability approximately $18 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2003. For 2003, the Company lowered the expected long term rate of return assumption from 9% to 8.5% for the Companys defined benefit pension plan reflecting lower expected long term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The plan maintains between 60 to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in high quality corporate bonds and bond index funds. Including the effect of this change, pension expense for this plan for the year ended December 31, 2003 was approximately $8.5 million (or $5.7 million on an after tax basis), compared with $1.9 million (or $1.2 million after tax) for this plan in 2002. While not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan for 2003, the Company contributed $10 million to the plan before December 31, 2003. The Company anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2004. As noted above, the Company curtailed benefits for substantially all associates under the defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2003. The Company will maintain this curtailed plan for the foreseeable future and, as a result, will continue to record the effect of changes in discount rates and expected rates of returns on plan assets on both the minimum pension liability recorded as well as the amount of pension expense reflected in the statement of earnings for future periods. In addition, as part of curtailing benefits under this plan, the Company expanded benefits under its available defined contribution (401 K) plan. The net effect of these plan changes are expected to increase the Companys total pension expense by approximately $15.9 million (or $10.9 million after tax) for 2004 compared to 2003. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 under (1) long term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long term liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet under GAAP. Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years (in millions) Debt and Leases: Long Term Debt Obligations (a) $ 1,277.7 $ 12.2 $ 458.7 $ 250.5 $ 556.3 Capital Lease Obligations 21.2 2.2 4.7 5.3 9.0 Total Long Term Debt $ 1,298.9 $ 14.4 $ 463.4 $ 255.8 $ 565.3 Operating Lease Obligations (b) 200.0 44.0 71.0 53.0 32.0 Other: Purchase Obligations (c) 45.1 22.9 22.2 Other Long Term Liabilities Reflected on the Companys Balance Sheet Under GAAP (d) 578.8 160.5 90.0 328.3 Total $ 2,122.8 $ 81.3 $ 717.1 $ 398.8 $ 925.6 21 (a) As described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (b) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (c) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services for consideration greater than $1 million that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. (d) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies, performance and operating cost guarantees and estimated environmental remediation costs, post retirement health, pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation liabilities. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon managements estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of certain commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 111.0 $ 55.0 $ 39.0 $ 2.0 $ 15.0 Guarantees 84.0 81.0 2.0 1.0 Contingent Acquisition Consideration 97.1 10.3 20.0 46.8 20.0 Total Commercial Commitments $ 292.1 $ 146.3 $ 61.0 $ 48.8 $ 36.0 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Companys Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $75 million, $93 million and $92 million as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities a replacement of SFAS No. 125. A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions. In connection with the Companys acquisition of Thomson, the Company has entered into agreements to pay $15 million over the next 6 years, and an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $60 million cash based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. In connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions, the Company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $36.8 million in November 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through November 2008. The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the Companys downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 22 Except as described above, the Company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2003. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2003. Other Contingent Liabilities Certain of the Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and, based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the factors described above under Item 1. Business Environmental and Safety Regulations. In addition, the Company is from time to time party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. In view of the Companys financial position and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability, if any, related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous material handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its cash flow. In addition, the ongoing cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Companys cash flows or financial position. In addition, the Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The Company believes that the results of this litigation and other pending legal proceedings will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys cash flows, even before taking into account any related insurance recoveries. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Companys customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings, cash flows and balance sheet. Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys cash flows and balance sheet. Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the new accounting standard for goodwill, which requires 23 that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Long lived assets. The Company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Companys long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, long lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Companys experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired companys business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Companys results of operations. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by this item is included under Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 24
