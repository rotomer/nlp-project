ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with its audited consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW Danaher Corporation derives its sales from the design, manufacture and marketing of industrial and consumer products, which are typically characterized by strong brand names, proprietary technology and major market positions, in three business segments: Professional Instrumentation, Industrial Technologies and Tools & Components. The Company strives to create shareholder value through: delivering sales growth, excluding the impact of acquired businesses, in excess of the overall market growth for its products and services; upper quartile financial performance when compared against peer companies; and upper quartile cash flow generation from operations when compared against peer companies. To accomplish these goals, the Company uses a set of tools and processes, known as the DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM (DBS), which are designed to continuously improve business performance in critical areas of quality, delivery, cost and innovation. The Company will acquire businesses when they strategically fit with existing operations or when they are of such a nature and size as to establish a new strategic line of business. The extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect the Companys overall growth and operating results. The Company also acquires businesses that it believes can help it achieve the objectives described above. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations and approximately 45% of 2004 sales derived outside the United States. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry economic and political factors. However, Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its product sales and services, has helped limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the outlook for the Company. The Companys individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, the Companys order rates are highly indicative of the Companys future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Companys customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. While differences exist among the Companys businesses, the Companys markets generally strengthened in the second half of 2003 and remained strong throughout 2004. Consolidated revenues for 2004 increased approximately 30% over 2003. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 18.5% growth, favorable currency translation, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, contributed approximately 2.5% growth and revenues from existing businesses for the year (defined as businesses that have been part of the Company for each comparable period reported excluding currency effect) contributed 9% growth. During 2004, the Company acquired Radiometer A/S, substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of the Gendex business of Dentsply International, Inc., and Kaltenbach & Voigt Gmbh (KaVo), which together form the core of a new Medical Technology business. The Medical Technology business, which is included in the Companys Professional Instrumentation segment, is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company both through growth of its existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. While the Company continues to see broad based strength across most of its businesses and end markets, based on current order rates, certain businesses are expected to experience moderating growth in 2005 due to current global economic conditions, a slowing semi conductor market and more difficult comparisons with the 2004 periods, which were very strong by historical standards. The Company continues to operate in a highly competitive business environment in most of the markets and geographies served. The Companys performance will be impacted by its ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in the markets and geographies served, including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force, consolidation of competitors and the expansion of market opportunities in Asia. The Company will continue to assess market needs with the objective of positioning itself to provide superior products and services to its customers in a cost efficient manner. With the formation of the Medical Technology business noted above, the Company is devoting significant attention to the successful integration of these acquired businesses into the organization. 15 Table of Contents Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, a substantial portion of its sales are derived from foreign countries. Sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates, which are outside of the control of management. As noted above, the Company benefited from the impact of favorable currency trends in its international businesses during 2004 when compared to 2003. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and profit in the consolidated financial statements. While currency rates continued to produce positive comparisons on a year over year basis, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies could adversely impact the Companys results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table summarizes sales by business segment for each of the past three years: For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Professional Instrumentation $ 2,915.7 $ 1,916.0 $ 1,676.1 Industrial Technologies 2,667.3 2,180.7 1,709.0 Tools & Components 1,306.3 1,197.2 1,192.1 Total $ 6,889.3 $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENTATION Businesses in the Professional Instrumentation segment offer professional and technical customers various products and services that are used in connection with the performance of their work. As of December 31, 2004, Professional Instrumentation was Danahers largest segment and encompassed three strategic businesses, Environmental, Electronic Test, and Medical Technology. These businesses produce and sell compact, professional electronic test tools and calibration equipment; water quality instrumentation and consumables and ultraviolet disinfection systems; retail/commercial petroleum products and services, including underground storage tank leak detection systems; critical care diagnostic instruments and a wide range of products used by dental professionals. Professional Instrumentation Selected Financial Data Operating Performance For the years ended December 31 ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 2,915.7 $ 1,916.0 $ 1,676.1 Operating profit 544.0 357.5 298.2 Operating profit as a % of sales 18.7 % 18.7 % 17.8 % 16 Table of Contents Components of Sales Growth 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Existing businesses 8.5 % 1.0 % Acquisitions 39.5 % 8.0 % Impact of foreign currency 4.0 % 5.5 % Total 52.0 % 14.5 % 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Segment Overview Sales of the Professional Instrumentation segment increased approximately 52% in 2004 compared to 2003, largely as a result of sales from acquired businesses, which contributed approximately 39.5% of the overall increase. Sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 8.5% growth compared to 2003, principally from sales increases in the environmental and electronic test and measurement businesses. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to overall sales growth compared to 2003. Favorable currency translation impact accounted for approximately 4% of the overall sales increase. Operating profit margins for the segment were 18.7% in 2004, flat compared to 2003. Operating profit margin improvements in the Companys existing operations were offset by the lower operating margins of acquired businesses, primarily KaVo, which diluted segment margins by approximately 200 basis points compared with 2003. The Company continues to pursue on going cost reductions through application of the Danaher Business System and low cost region sourcing and production initiatives which are expected to further improve operating margins at both existing and newly acquired businesses in future periods. Business Overview Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 49% of segment sales in 2004, increased approximately 16% in 2004 compared to 2003. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 3% growth, sales from existing businesses provided 9% growth and favorable currency translation provided 4% growth. Sales were positively impacted by continued strength in the Gilbarco Veeder Root retail petroleum equipment business. Gilbarco Veeder Root delivered low double digit growth rates for the full year 2004, but slowed to a mid single digit growth rate on a comparable basis during the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of comparisons with the higher sales levels that began in the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, growth rates for the first quarter of 2004 benefited from the comparison to the softness experienced in the first quarter of 2003 prior to the Iraq war. Strength in sales of retail automation and leak detection equipment in the U.S., Europe and China were the primary drivers of the growth from existing businesses. Year over year growth rates in this business are expected to continue slowing in early 2005 as a result of the significant sales growth experienced in early 2004. Hach/Langes sales growth from existing businesses also contributed to the increase with high single digit growth. Hach/Lange achieved higher than market growth in both the laboratory and process instrumentation markets in both the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, Europe, and also experienced continued strength in China. The Companys Hach Ultra Analytics business reported accelerated growth in the second half of 2004 driven by strong U.S. and Asian sales. The business continues to benefit from strength in the electronics and food and beverage end markets. The acquisition of Trojan Technologies in November 2004 establishes the business lines drinking and waste water disinfection market position and is expected to generate approximately $100 million in incremental sales for the business in 2005. Electronic Test. Electronic test sales, representing approximately 28% of segment sales in 2004, grew 19.5% during 2004 compared to 2003. Acquisitions accounted for approximately 7.5% growth, revenues from existing businesses provided 8.5% growth and favorable currency translation provided 3.5% growth. Year over year growth rates in the second half of 2004 (on a days adjusted basis) declined somewhat from the rates reported in the first half of 2004. The decline is the result of lapping stronger sales quarters which began for this business in the second half of 2003 as well as a result of the expiration of a multi year resale agreement relating to a low margin product line. Growth resulted from strength in the U.S. industrial channel, the European electrical channel and overall strong growth in China. The Companys network test business achieved 20% growth during the year, reflecting continued strength in network analysis, copper and fiber equipment sales and strong enterprise market share gains. The business also benefited from delivery of a large order in the fourth quarter of 2004 for test equipment to service a telecommunication customers next generation service offerings. 17 Table of Contents Medical Technology. Medical technology represented approximately 23% of segment sales in 2004. All of this sales growth represents acquisition related growth as this line of business was established in 2004 with the acquisitions of Radiometer, Gendex and KaVo. Radiometers critical care diagnostics business experienced growth across all major geographies, driven by strong instrument placements and related accessory sales. Radiometers high single digit sales growth was somewhat offset by the KaVo and Gendex dental unit business, which was impacted by significant pre acquisition sales incentive programs in the United States and Japan implemented by the former owners. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Segment Overview Sales of the Professional Instrumentation segment increased 14.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions provided an 8.0% increase in segment sales due primarily to the acquisitions of Gilbarco and Raytek in 2002 as well as the impact of several smaller acquisitions. Sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 1.0% in 2003 compared to 2002, principally from sales increases in the Companys environmental businesses. Prices were essentially flat compared to 2002. Favorable currency translation impact generated 5.5% growth in 2003 compared to 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 18.7% in 2003 compared to 17.8% in 2002. Operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by ongoing cost reductions associated with the Companys DBS initiatives completed during 2003 and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses. Business Overview Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 65% of segment sales in 2003, increased approximately 15.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions completed in 2002 and 2003 accounted for approximately 7.5% growth, sales from existing businesses provided 2% growth and favorable currency translation provided 6% growth. Operations were impacted by strength in the second half of 2003 in the Gilbarco Veeder Root retail petroleum equipment business, resulting in part from market share gains in the U.S. due to the addition of a number of distributors as a result of financial difficulties of a competitor. Increased sales to high volume retailers and strong year end purchasing activity from major oil companies with respect to both retail automation and environmental systems also contributed to the strength in the second half of 2003. Sales from existing businesses in the Companys water quality businesses also contributed to the increase as strength in laboratory instrumentation sales in Europe was partially offset by softness in the U.S. laboratory instrumentation and ultrapure markets due to weakness in the semiconductor and electrical assembly markets and due to several large contracts in 2002 not repeating in 2003. Electronic Test. Electronic test sales, representing approximately 35% of 2003s segment sales, grew 13% during 2003 compared to 2002. Acquisitions, principally the Raytek Corporation acquisition, completed in August 2002, provided 9% growth, which includes strong sales of Rayteks non contact temperature measurement and thermal imaging products. Favorable currency translation provided 5% growth. These factors were partially offset by an approximate 1% decline in sales from existing businesses due primarily to softness in telecommunications and data network markets. The Companys network test business strengthened in the second half of 2003, compared to the first half of 2003, to post low single digit declines for the year. INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub systems that are typically incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end products and systems, as well by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic businesses, Motion and Product Identification, and three focused niche businesses: Power Quality, Aerospace and Defense, and Sensors & Controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; motion, position, speed, temperature, and level instruments and sensing devices; power switches and controls; power protection products; liquid flow and quality measuring devices; safety devices; and electronic and mechanical counting and controlling devices. 18 Table of Contents Industrial Technologies Segment Selected Financial Data Operating Performance For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 2,667.3 $ 2,180.7 $ 1,709.1 Operating profit 393.5 316.8 242.3 Operating profit as a % of sales 14.8 % 14.5 % 14.2 % Components of Sales Growth 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Existing businesses 9.0 % 3.0 % Acquisition 10.5 % 20.0 % Impact of foreign currency 3.0 % 4.5 % Total 22.5 % 27.5 % 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Segment Overview Sales of the Industrial Technologies segment increased approximately 22.5% in 2004 compared to 2003. Sales from existing businesses for this segment contributed approximately 9% to the overall growth compared to 2003, driven by sales increases in all businesses with particularly strong sales increases in the Companys motion businesses. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, were negligible compared to 2003. Acquisitions contributed approximately 10.5% to the growth during the year driven in large part by acquisitions within the Companys product identification business. The impact of favorable currency translation generated approximately 3% growth compared to 2003. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.8% in 2004 compared to 14.5% in 2003. The overall improvement in operating profit margins for 2004 was driven primarily by additional leverage from sales growth, on going cost reductions associated with Danaher Business System initiatives and reductions in manufacturing costs through low cost region sourcing and production initiatives implemented during 2004 and 2003. Margin improvements were partially offset by lower margins associated with the start up stage of new business initiatives with certain OEMs in the Companys motion business. Business Overview Motion. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 36% of 2004s segment sales, grew 20% in 2004 compared to 2003, as sales from existing businesses contributed 13% to the overall reported growth, acquisitions provided growth of 3.5% and favorable currency translation effects provided 3.5% growth. The growth in sales from existing businesses continued to be broad based, both geographically and across the markets served. The North American market for direct drive products, and the worldwide semiconductor and flat panel display markets demonstrated particular strength during 2004 and contributed significantly to the businesses overall growth. Some general signs of softening in the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets served by the motion businesses have tempered managements growth expectations with respect to these businesses for 2005. The business has experienced a significant increase in sales associated with electric vehicle projects won in prior periods and believes it has captured market share in 2004 as many motion control applications have shifted to the use of AC motor technology solutions. The Companys linear actuator product businesses continued to grow in 2004, primarily resulting from strong market growth for ball screw and gearbox product offerings in both North America and Europe. Growth rates in 2005 are expected to decline from the rates experienced in 2004 as the business begins to compare against these very strong 2004 sales levels and also because of the softening in the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets referred to above. 19 Table of Contents Product Identification. The product identification business accounted for approximately 25% of segment revenues in 2004. For 2004, product identification revenues grew 38.5% compared to 2003, with acquisitions providing 29% growth, favorable currency impacts of approximately 3.5%, and sales from existing operations providing 6% growth. Growth in sales from existing businesses was broad based across the product portfolio. The growth was driven by strong equipment sales, primarily continuous ink jet printer sales in China and North America, but increasingly in the laser, thermal transfer overprint and binary array product offerings. Year over year growth rates for the second half of 2004 were somewhat lower compared with the growth rates in the first half of 2004 reflecting the normalization of revenues associated with the 2003 Willett acquisition as well as continued integration activities related to recent acquisitions. The newly acquired reading and scanning business also experienced growth, primarily from systems installation projects with the United States Postal Service. The January 2005 acquisition of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a UK based coding and marking business adds new distribution channels in key markets such as Germany, Japan and the United States. Linx had revenues of approximately $93 million in 2004. Focused Niche Businesses. The segments niche businesses in the aggregate showed 16% sales growth in 2004, primarily from high single digit growth from existing businesses, largely attributable to the Companys Sensors & Controls and Aerospace & Defense businesses, and to a lesser extent due to the impact of acquisitions in the Companys Aerospace and Defense businesses. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Segment Overview Sales of the Industrial Technologies segment increased 27.5% in 2003 compared to 2002. The fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Thomson Industries and the 2003 acquisition of Willett International Limited (Willett), together with several other smaller acquisitions provided a 20.0% increase in segment sales. This increase was in addition to an approximate 4.5% favorable currency translation impact. Sales from existing businesses for this segment were up approximately 3.0% in 2003 compared to 2002, principally from sales increases in the motion, and product identification businesses. Prices were essentially flat in 2003 compared to 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.5% in 2003 compared to 14.2% in 2002. Operating profit margins for 2002 included approximately 40 basis points of benefit associated with gains on the sale of real estate and adjustments to the restructuring reserves established in 2001. The overall improvement in operating profit margins was driven primarily by on going cost reductions associated with the Companys DBS initiatives completed during 2003, and margin improvements in recently acquired businesses, which typically have higher cost structures than the Companys existing operations. Business Overview Motion. Sales in the Companys motion businesses, representing approximately 37% of 2003s segment sales, grew 33% in 2003 compared to 2002, as acquisitions provided growth of 21% (primarily from the Thomson Industries acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2002) and favorable currency translation effects provided 8% growth to drive this increase. The existing businesses sales accounted for 4% growth, reflecting share gains in certain of its end markets, including electric vehicles and direct drives, partially offset by year over year low single digit declines in the Companys linear actuator product businesses resulting from integration of the sales channels associated with the Thomson acquisition. The Companys linear actuator businesses showed low single digit growth in the fourth quarter which represented the first quarter of growth for this business in 2003, due to increased shipments for military programs as well as increased sales to the Companys distribution network. Product Identification. In February 2002, the Company established its Product Identification business with the acquisition of Videojet Technologies. In January 2003 Willett was added to this business and Accu Sort Systems, Inc. was acquired in November 2003. The Product Identification business accounted for approximately 22% of segment sales in 2003. For 2003, Product Identification sales grew 65% compared to 2002, with the Willett and Accu Sort acquisitions providing 55% growth, favorable currency impacts of approximately 5%, and existing operations providing 5% growth, based largely on broad based equipment sales increases. Focused Niche Businesses. The segments niche businesses in the aggregate showed high single digit sales growth in 2003, primarily from acquisitions in the Companys Aerospace and Defense and Sensors and Controls businesses. TOOLS & COMPONENTS The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest domestic producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment; drill chucks; custom designed headed tools and components; and high quality precision socket screws, fasteners, and miniature precision parts. 20 Table of Contents Tools & Components Selected Financial Data For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 1,306.3 $ 1,197.2 $ 1,192.1 Operating profit 198.3 173.8 181.4 Operating profit as a % of sales 15.2 % 14.5 % 15.2 % Components of Sales Growth 2004 vs. 2003 2003 vs. 2002 Existing businesses 9.5 % 0.5 % Divestiture (0.5 )% Impact of foreign currency Total 9.0 % 0.5 % 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 Sales in the Tools & Components segment grew 9% in 2004 compared to 2003. Sales volumes from existing businesses contributed 9.5% and were offset slightly by the impact of a small divestiture during the year. There were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2004 or 2003. Price increases, which are included in sales from existing businesses, contributed less than 1% to reported revenue. Currency impacts on revenues were negligible. Sales in the Mechanics Hand Tools business, representing approximately two thirds of segment sales in 2004, grew approximately 8.5% for the year, driven primarily by increases in sales from the groups retail hand tool product lines, mobile distribution business and industrial distribution businesses. Sell through at the groups major retail customer was in line with the groups sales to this customer during the period. The Companys Matco business grew at low double digit rates for 2004 which the Company believes outpaced the overall market growth. The Companys engine retarder and chuck businesses also experienced low double digit growth rates. The other niche businesses within the segment also experienced mid to high single digit growth rates during 2004. Operating profit margins for the segment were 15.2% in 2004 compared to 14.5% in 2003. This improvement was driven by leverage on increased sales volume and the impact of cost reduction programs implemented in 2003 and 2004 offset partially by increases in price and surcharges related to steel purchases incurred in the third quarter. Price increases have been implemented to recover a portion of the increase in raw material costs. The Company announced a plant closing in the fourth quarter of 2004 which reduced overall operating profit for 2004 by about $5 million. Completing the plant closure is expected to cost approximately $6 million in 2005 and as a result there will be minimal benefit to operating margins from this closure in 2005. The Company does not expect this closure to have a positive contribution to earnings until 2006. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Sales in the Tools & Components segment grew approximately 0.5% in 2003. All of this growth represents growth in sales volume from existing businesses, as there were no acquisitions in this segment during either 2002 or 2003. Price and currency impacts on sales were negligible. Mechanics Hand Tools sales, representing approximately two thirds of segment sales in 2003, grew approximately 3.5% for the year, driven primarily by increases in sales from the groups retail hand tool product lines which rebounded in the second half of 2003 as sales to the groups largest customer strengthened through the third and fourth quarters of 2003. In addition, both the Companys Matco and Asian distribution channels showed growth for 2003. Offsetting these increases was a net sales decline in the segments niche businesses, as weakness in shipments of truck and industrial boxes, drill chucks and pole line hardware driven by weak end markets and increased competition from low cost competitors was partially offset by revenue 21 Table of Contents gains in the Companys wheel service equipment product lines. Also, sales of diesel engine retarders fell during 2003, reflecting decreased end user demand as compared to 2002. In 2002, the business experienced an inventory build up by customers in advance of regulatory changes implemented in 2002. Operating profit margins for the segment were 14.5% in 2003 compared to 15.2% in 2002. Operating profit margins in 2002 benefited by 10 basis points from the reversal of unutilized accruals established for the 2001 restructuring program. Margin improvements at the Jacobs Chuck business unit related to the 2001 restructuring program, and other cost reductions, were offset by margin declines at the Delta Industries business unit related to the volume decrease noted above, the impact of lower engine retarder sales, and by spending on certain cost reduction and growth opportunities. GROSS PROFIT For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 6,889.3 $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 Cost of sales 3,996.6 3,154.8 2,791.2 Gross profit $ 2,892.7 $ 2,139.1 $ 1,786.0 Gross profit margin 42.0 % 40.4 % 39.0 % Gross profit margins for 2004 improved 160 basis points to 42.0% compared to 40.4% in 2003. This improvement results primarily from leverage on increased sales volume. In addition, gross profit margins were impacted by generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired (principally Radiometer) and the ongoing cost improvements in existing business units driven by the Companys Danaher Business System processes and low cost region sourcing and production initiatives. Increases in cost and surcharges related to steel purchases partially offset these improvements. While gross profit margins improved in 2004 for the reasons stated above, these improvements could be negatively affected in future periods by higher raw material costs and supply constraints resulting from the improved overall economy or by any significant slowdown in the economy. As indicated above, price increases have been implemented to recover some of the increases in raw material costs experienced in 2004. Gross profit margin for 2003 was 40.4%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to 39.0% in 2002. This increase results from the benefits of the 2001 restructuring program, on going cost improvements in existing business units driven by the Companys Danaher Business System processes, generally higher gross profit margins in businesses acquired, cost reductions in business units acquired during the first quarter of 2002 and the leverage created from higher revenues during the year. The Companys restructuring program announced in the fourth quarter of 2001 was estimated to have provided approximately $38 million of savings to the full year 2003 when compared against the 2001 period and $19 million when compared against the 2002 period. This restructuring was complete at the beginning of 2003. OPERATING EXPENSES For the years ended December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Sales $ 6,889.3 $ 5,293.9 $ 4,577.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,795.7 1,316.4 1,097.4 SG&A as a % of sales 26.1 % 24.9 % 24.0 % In 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.1% of sales, an increase of 120 basis points from 2003 levels. This increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities and cost reduction opportunities throughout the Company, the impact of newly acquired businesses (principally Radiometer and KaVo) and their higher relative operating expense structures, and the increased proportion of sales derived from the Companys international operations which generally have higher operating expense structures compared to the Company as a whole. 22 Table of Contents In 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.9% of sales, an increase of 90 basis points from 2002 levels. This increase is due primarily to additional spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. GAIN ON PENSION PLAN CURTAILMENT The Company recorded a curtailment gain in 2003 as a result of freezing substantially all associates ongoing participation in its Cash Balance Plan effective December 31, 2003. The gain totaled $22.5 million ($14.6 million after tax, or $0.05 per share) and represents the unrecognized benefits associated with prior plan amendments that were being amortized into income over the remaining service period of the participating associates prior to freezing the plan. As discussed in more detail below, the Company will continue recording pension expense related to this plan, primarily representing interest costs on the accumulated benefit obligation and amortization of actuarial losses accumulated in the plan prior to the above curtailment. INTEREST COSTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities and Indebtedness below. Interest expense of $55 million in 2004 was approximately $4 million lower than the corresponding 2003 period. The decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the cessation of amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Companys LYONS, offset slightly by the unfavorable impact of the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the Companys $406.8 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005. Interest expense of $59 million in 2003 was approximately $5 million higher than the corresponding 2002 period. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of the Euro/US Dollar exchange rate on interest expense related to the Companys Eurobond notes due 2005 partially offset by reduced debt levels resulting from net repayments of approximately $146 million of outstanding indebtedness during 2003. Interest income of $7.6 million, $10.1 million and $10.3 million was recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Average invested cash balances decreased in 2004 compared with the levels of 2003 due to employing these cash balances to complete several acquisitions. The decline in interest income as a result of these lower invested cash balances was partially offset by the Company maintaining a higher proportion of available cash in international markets which have higher overall interest rates and higher short term rates in 2004. Average invested cash balances grew during 2002 and 2003, but have been largely offset by lower average interest rates earned on these deposits. INCOME TAXES The Companys effective tax rate may be affected by business acquisitions and dispositions, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, material audit assessments and changes in tax laws. The tax effect of significant unusual items or changes in tax regulations are reflected in the period in which they occur. The Companys effective tax rate differed from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. United States income taxes have not been provided on earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States and the amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States was approximately $1.6 billion. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act) provides the Company with an opportunity to repatriate up to $500 million of foreign earnings during 2005 at an effective US tax rate of 5.25%. At the present time, the Company has no intention to repatriate any foreign earnings under the provisions of the Act. The company will continue to re evaluate its position throughout the year, especially if there are changes or proposed changes in foreign tax laws or in the US taxation of international businesses. The 2004 effective tax rate of 29.5% was 3.1% lower than the 2003 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of non U.S. earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 as well as the impact of changes made to the Companys international tax structure, primarily related to the acquisition and integration of Radiometer and KaVo during 2004. The Company expects to further reduce its effective tax rate for 2005 to 27.5% reflecting the continuing benefit of deriving an increasing proportion of the Companys earnings from international operations. The 2003 effective tax rate of 32.6% was 1.4% lower than the 2002 effective rate, mainly due to the effect of a higher proportion of foreign earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 and the impact of additional research and experimentation credits available to reduce the U.S. tax liabilities. The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that is has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Companys estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are determined or resolved. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which the Companys earnings and or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates. 23 Table of Contents INFLATION The effect of inflation on the Companys operations has been minimal in 2004, 2003, and 2002. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole. Interest Rate Risk The fair value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of this debt is subject to change as a result of movements in interest rates. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate this potential impact. Based on a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2004, the market value of the Companys fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately $13 million. This methodology has certain limitations, and these hypothetical gains or losses would not be reflected in the Companys results of operations or financial condition under current accounting principles. In January 2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements for the term of the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 6% notes due 2008 having an aggregate notional principal amount of $100 million whereby the effective interest rate on $100 million of these notes is the six month LIBOR rate plus approximately 0.425%. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the Company accounts for these swap agreements as fair value hedges. These instruments qualify as effective or perfect hedges. Other than the above noted swap arrangements, there were no material derivative financial instrument transactions during any of the periods presented. Additionally, the Company does not have significant commodity contracts or derivatives. Exchange Rate Risk The Company has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products globally. As a result, it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures and sells products and services. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The Companys issuance of Eurobond notes in 2000 provides a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its foreign operations without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, interest rate swap agreements and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company anticipates, however, that counter parties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments and its interest rate swap agreements with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments, it does periodically evaluate the credit standing of the counter party financial institutions. In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of its customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate. 24 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity For the years ended, December 31, ($ in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Total operating cash flows $ 1,033.2 $ 861.5 $ 710.3 Purchases of property, plant and equipment (115.9 ) (80.3 ) (65.4 ) Cash paid for acquisitions (1,591.7 ) (312.3 ) (1,158.1 ) Other sources 74.0 24.5 79.0 Net cash used in investing activities (1,633.6 ) (368.1 ) (1,144.5 ) Proceeds from the issuance of common stock 45.9 50.5 512.1 Proceeds (repayments) of borrowings, net (66.3 ) (145.5 ) 17.7 Dividends paid (17.7 ) (15.3 ) (13.5 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (38.1 ) (110.3 ) 516.3 Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity was $1,033 million for 2004, an increase of $172 million, or approximately 20% as compared to 2003. Earnings growth contributed $209 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003, which was somewhat offset by year over year changes in working capital as discussed below. As of December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately $609 million of cash and cash equivalents. Acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash in all periods presented. The Company acquired thirteen companies and product lines during 2004 for total consideration of approximately $1.6 billion in cash, including transaction costs. The Companys Eurobond notes mature July 2005. The Company currently anticipates that at maturity the Eurobond notes will be satisfied from available cash, through the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under existing credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets, or through a combination of some or all of these alternatives. Operating Activities The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long term basis. Operating cash flow, a key source of the Companys liquidity, was $1,033 million for 2004, an increase of $172 million, or approximately 20% as compared to 2003. Earnings growth contributed $209 million to the increase in operating cash flow in 2004 compared to 2003. In addition, additional deferred taxes related to 2004s earnings contributed approximately $19 million to the change in operating cash flows and depreciation and amortization contributed approximately $23 million to the improvement in cash flow on a year over year basis. Operating working capital, which the company defines as accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable, unfavorably impacted the year over year comparison between 2004 and 2003 as accounts receivable increased to support the higher sales the company experienced in 2004. Operating working capital still made an overall positive contribution to operating cash flow during 2004 due to continued emphasis on inventory management. Inventory levels decreased approximately $65 million in 2004 versus 2003 reflecting these efforts in both newly acquired businesses as well as the Companys existing operations. These improvements were partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses associated with the timing of payments for certain of the Companys benefit programs, including 401(k) and employee health plan contributions. 25 Table of Contents In connection with its acquisitions, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing duplicate facilities, severing redundant personnel and integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals established in connection with each acquisition. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.6 billion in 2004 compared to approximately $368 million of net cash used in 2003. Gross capital spending of $116 million for 2004 increased $36 million from 2003, due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the Companys low cost region manufacturing initiatives, new products and other growth opportunities. Net cash used in investing activities was $368 million in 2003 compared to approximately $1.1 billion of net cash used in 2002. Gross capital spending of $80 million for 2003 increased $15 million from 2002, due to capital spending relating to new acquisitions and spending related to the Companys low cost region sourcing initiatives. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacement of equipment and improving information technology systems. In 2005, the Company expects capital spending of approximately $150 million, although actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions. Disposals of fixed assets yielded approximately $31 million and $13 million of cash proceeds for 2004 and 2003. In addition, as discussed below, the Company completed several business acquisitions and divestitures during 2004, 2003 and 2002. All of the acquisitions during this time period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect the competitive nature of the process by which the businesses are acquired and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 5 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 2004 Acquisitions In January 2004, the Company acquired all of the share capital in Radiometer S/A for approximately $684 million in cash (net of $77 million in acquired cash), including transaction costs, pursuant to a tender offer announced on December 11, 2003. In addition, the Company assumed $66 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Radiometer designs, manufactures, and markets a variety of blood gas diagnostic instrumentation, primarily used in hospital applications. The Company also provides consumables and services for its instruments. Radiometer is a worldwide leader in its served markets, and has total annual sales of approximately $300 million. In May 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of KaVo for approximately 350 million (approximately $412 million) in cash, including transaction costs and net of $45 million in acquired cash. KaVo, headquartered in Biberach, Germany, with 2003 revenues of approximately $450 million, is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of dental equipment, including hand pieces, treatment units and diagnostic systems and laboratory equipment. This acquisition, combined with Radiometer and a smaller dental equipment business acquired earlier in 2004 are included in the Companys Medical Technology line of business. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company acquired, pursuant to a tender offer announced on October 1, 2004, all of the outstanding shares of Trojan Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of approximately $185 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of $23 million in acquired cash. In addition, the Company assumed $4 million of debt in connection with the acquisition. Trojan is a leader in the ultraviolet disinfection market for drinking and wastewater applications and has annual revenues of approximately $115 million. In addition to Radiometer, KaVo and Trojan, the Company acquired ten smaller companies and product lines during 2004 for total consideration of approximately $311 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of instrumentation products, in markets such as medical technology, electronic test, motion, environmental, product identification, sensors and controls, and aerospace and defense. These companies were all acquired to complement existing businesses or as additions to the newly formed Medical Technology line of business within the Professional Instrumentation segment. The aggregate annual sales of these acquired businesses is approximately $280 million. In addition, the company sold a business that was part of the Tools & Components segment during 2004. This business was insignificant to reported sales and earnings. Proceeds from this sale have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.5 million is included in gain on sale of real estate and other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 2003 Acquisitions The Company acquired twelve companies and product lines during 2003 for total consideration of approximately $312 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired. The Company also assumed debt with an estimated fair market value of approximately $45 million in connection with these acquisitions. In connection with one of the 2003 acquisitions, the Company entered into an agreement to pay an additional maximum contingent consideration of up to $36.8 million in November 2008 based on future performance of the acquired business through November 2008. In general, each company is a manufacturer and assembler of environmental or instrumentation products, in markets such as product identification, environmental and aerospace and defense. 26 Table of Contents These companies were all acquired to complement existing business units of the Professional Instrumentation or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregated annual revenue of the acquired businesses is approximately $361 million and each of these twelve companies individually has less than $125 million in annual revenues. In addition, the Company sold one facility acquired in connection with a prior acquisition for approximately $11.6 million in net proceeds. No gain or loss was recognized on the sale and the proceeds have been included in proceeds from divestitures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 2002 Acquisitions On February 25, 2002, the Company completed the divestiture of API Heat Transfer, Inc. to an affiliate of Madison Capital Partners for approximately $63 million (including $53 million in net cash and a note receivable in the principal amount of $10 million), less certain liabilities of API Heat Transfer, Inc. paid by the Company at and subsequent to closing. On February 5, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Data Systems, formerly known as Videojet Technologies, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $400 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 4, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Viridor Instrumentation Limited from the Pennon Group plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $137 million in net cash including transaction costs. On February 1, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Marconi Commerce Systems, formerly known as Gilbarco, from Marconi plc in a stock acquisition, for approximately $309 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $17 million of acquired cash). On October 18, 2002, the Company acquired 100% of Thomson Industries, Inc. in a stock and asset acquisition, for approximately $147 million in cash including transaction costs (net of $2 million of acquired cash), an agreement to pay $15 million over the next six years, and contingent consideration with a current maximum payout of $45 million based on the future performance of Thomson through December 31, 2005. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company acquired eight smaller companies, for total consideration of approximately $166 million in net cash including transaction costs. Recent Acquisition Developments In January 2005, the Company acquired, pursuant to a tender offer announced on October 6, 2004, approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of Linx Printing Technologies PLC, a publicly held United Kingdom company operating in the product identification market. The Company intends to acquire the remaining outstanding shares through the compulsory acquisition provisions of the applicable UK Companies legislation. Once all of the outstanding shares are acquired, it is expected that the total consideration for such shares will be approximately $171 million in cash, including estimated transaction costs and net of cash acquired. Linx complements the Companys product identification businesses and has annual revenue of approximately $93 million. Financing Activities and Indebtedness Financing activities used cash of $38 million during 2004 compared to $110 million used during 2003. The reduction in cash used in financing activities was directly related to lower levels of required principal repayments under the Companys outstanding debt obligations between periods. Total debt increased to $1,350 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $1,299 million at December 31, 2003. This increase was due primarily to change in the U.S Dollar/Euro exchange rates and the resulting increase in the carrying value of the Companys Euro denominated debt. The Company borrowed and repaid approximately $130 million in short term borrowings under an uncommitted financing arrangement to fund the acquisition of KaVo during the second quarter of 2004. All significant debt obligations assumed related to 2004 acquisitions have been repaid. The Companys debt financing as of December 31, 2004 was composed primarily of $567 million of zero coupon convertible notes due 2021 Liquid Yield Option Notes or LYONs (LYONs), $407 million of 6.25% Eurobond notes due 2005 and $250 million of 6% notes due 2008 (subject to the interest rate swaps described above). The Companys LYONs obligations (described in further detail below) carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Substantially all remaining borrowings have interest costs that float with referenced base rates. The Company maintains two revolving senior unsecured credit facilities totaling $1 billion available for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the revolving credit facilities bear interest of Eurocurrency rate plus 0.21% to 0.70%, depending on the Companys debt rating. The credit facilities, each $500 million, have a fixed term expiring June 28, 2006 and July 23, 2006, respectively. There were no borrowings outstanding under either of the Companys credit facilities at any time during 2004. The Companys Eurobond notes due in 2005 have been classified as a current obligation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet since the maturity date is within one year from December 31, 2004. The Company currently anticipates that at maturity the Eurobond notes will be satisfied from available cash, through the issuance of commercial paper, borrowings under existing credit facilities or by accessing the capital markets, or through a combination of some or all of these alternatives. During the first quarter of 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375%. Holders of the LYONs may convert each of their LYONs into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2004, 27 Table of Contents the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was $47 per share which, at that date, was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company. These notes were redeemed for cash. The Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period commencing after January 22, 2004 if the average market price of a LYON for a measurement period preceding such six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The Company has not and is not currently required to pay contingent interest under this agreement. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity. The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt. However, a downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys credit facilities. Also, a downgrade in the Companys credit rating could limit, or in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude the Companys ability to consider commercial paper as a potential source of financing. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2004 were $17.7 million. Cash and Cash Requirements As of December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately $609 million of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the aforementioned debt instruments, including limitations on secured debt and debt levels. In addition, as of the date of this Form 10 K, the Company could issue up to $1 billion of securities under its shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its pension plans as required and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order to meet these cash requirements, the Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds. The Company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions consummated during 2005 would be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the establishment of a commercial paper program, through borrowings under its credit facilities, under uncommitted lines of credit or by accessing the capital markets. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy both short term and long term requirements. The Companys cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. Most of the amounts held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient inter company transfer of funds, the Companys intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities Due to declines in the equity markets in 2001 and 2002, the fair value of the Companys pension fund assets decreased below the accumulated benefit obligation due to the participants in the plan. As a result, in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded a minimum pension liability reduction of $6.9 million (net of tax expense of $3.7 million) at December 31, 2004. The minimum pension liability is calculated as the difference between the actuarially determined accumulated benefit obligation and the value of the plan assets as of September 30, 2004 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 for additional information). This adjustment results in a direct credit to stockholders equity and does not immediately impact net earnings, but is included in other comprehensive income. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in such calculations. These assumptions include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company used a 5.75% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2004, which represented a decrease in the discount rate of 0.25% from the rate used at December 31, 2003. A further 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the after tax minimum pension liability approximately $14 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2004. For 2004, the Company estimated the expected long term rate of return assumption at 8.5% which is consistent with the rate used in 2003. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long term returns on equity and debt 28 Table of Contents investments included in plan assets. The plan maintains between 60% to 70% of its assets in equity portfolios, which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities. The balance of the asset portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension expense for this plan for the year ended December 31, 2004 was approximately $4.3 million (or $3.0 million on an after tax basis), compared with $8.5 million (or $5.7 million on an after tax basis and excluding the $22.5 million gain on curtailment recognized in 2003) for this plan in 2003. If the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by an additional 50 basis points, pension expense for 2004 would have increased approximately $2.4 million (or $ 1.7 million on an after tax basis). The Company intends on lowering the assumed rate of return on plan assets to 8.0% for 2005. The Company was not statutorily required to make contributions to the plan in 2004 and anticipates there will be no statutory funding requirements for the defined benefit plan in 2005. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 under (1) long term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long term liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet under GAAP.

(e) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self insurance and litigation claims, post retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and deferred compensation liabilities. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon managements estimates over the terms of these agreements and are largely based upon historical experience. 29 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of certain off balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company. Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period TotalAmountsCommitted Less Than One Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More Than 5 Years (in millions) Standby Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds $ 137.1 $ 95.2 $ 35.2 $ 6.3 $ 0.4 Guarantees 49.2 43.9 1.6 3.7 Contingent Acquisition Consideration 95.0 10.0 39.0 46.0 Total $ 281.3 $ 149.1 $ 75.8 $ 52.3 $ 4.1 Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short term contracts to purchase raw materials and components for manufacture and for performance under specific manufacturing agreements. Guarantees reflected in the table above primarily relate to the Companys Matco subsidiary, which has sold, with recourse, or provided credit enhancements for certain of its accounts receivable and notes receivable. This program has been used to assist Matcos customers in obtaining initial start up financing for their franchise. Amounts outstanding under this program approximated $29 million as of December 31, 2004. The subsidiary accounts for such sales in accordance with SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities a replacement of SFAS No. 125. A provision for estimated losses as a result of the recourse has been included in accrued expenses. No gain or loss arose from these transactions. In connection with three separate past acquisitions, the Company has entered into agreements with the respective sellers to pay certain amounts in the future as additional purchase price. The Company could pay nothing in the aggregate over the next five years pursuant to these agreements, or a maximum of up to $95.0 million over the next five years depending on the future performance of the respective businesses. The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, the Company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Due to the Companys downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Except as described above, the Company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2004. Also, the Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities as of December 31, 2004. Other Contingent Liabilities Certain of the Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Company must also comply with various health and safety regulations in both the United States and abroad in connection with its operations. In addition to the environmental compliance costs, the Company may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling practices. The Company has projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities, in both the United States and abroad, to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. The ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the factors described above under Item 1. Business Environmental and Safety Regulations. In addition, the Company is from time to time 30 Table of Contents party to personal injury or other claims brought by private parties alleging injury due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances. In view of the Companys financial position and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, the Company believes that its liability, if any, related to past or current waste disposal practices and other hazardous material handling practices will not have a material adverse effect on its cash flow or financial condition. In addition, the ongoing cost of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows, capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Certain of the Companys products are medical devices that are subject to regulation by the FDA and by the counterpart agencies of the foreign countries where the products are sold, as well as federal, state and local regulations governing the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations. The Company is also required to comply with various export control and economic sanctions laws. Non United States governments have also implemented similar export control regulations, which may affect Company operations or transactions subject to their jurisdictions. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable regulations governing such export control and economic sanctions laws. Please refer to Note 10 to the consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual Report for information regarding certain outstanding litigation matters. In addition, the Company is, from time to time, subject to routine litigation incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products, allegations of patent and trademark infringement and trade secret misappropriation, and litigation and administrative proceedings involving employment matters and commercial disputes. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, auto, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes covers a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to protect the Company against potential loss exposures. The Company believes that the results of these litigation matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the Companys cash flows or financial condition, even before taking into account any related insurance recoveries. The Company carries significant deductibles and self insured retentions for workers compensation, property, automobile, product and general liability costs, and management believes that the Company maintains adequate accruals to cover the retained liability. Management determines the Companys accrual for self insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. The company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of such director or officer serving any other entity at the request of the Company, subject to limited exceptions. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect managements more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Companys customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition. 31 Table of Contents Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company would be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition. Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur. The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, the accounting standard for goodwill, which requires that the Company, on an annual basis, calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists. Impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. Long lived assets. The Company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Judgments made by the Company relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets and are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. Since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets, there is risk that the carrying value of the Companys long lived assets may require adjustment in future periods. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, long lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings. The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of the Companys reporting units as of October 2, 2004, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $138 million to approximately $2.6 billion. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease excluding the recently acquired Medical Technology reporting unit, would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $108 million to approximately $2.3 billion for each of the Companys reporting units. Purchase accounting. In connection with its acquisitions, the Company formulates a plan related to the future integration of the acquired entity. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 95 3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, the Company accrues estimates for certain of the integration costs anticipated at the date of acquisition, including personnel reductions and facility closures or restructurings. Adjustments to these estimates are made up to 12 months from the acquisition date as plans are finalized. The Company establishes these accruals based on information obtained during the due diligence process, the Companys experience in acquiring other companies, and information obtained after the closing about the acquired companys business, assets and liabilities. The accruals established by the Company are inherently uncertain because they are based on limited information on the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business as well as the uncertainty of the cost to execute the integration plans for the business. If the accruals established by the Company are insufficient to account for all of the activities required to integrate the acquired entity, the Company would be required to incur an expense, which would adversely affect the Companys results of operations. To the extent these accruals are not utilized for the intended purpose, the excess is recorded as a reduction of the purchase price, typically by reducing recorded goodwill balances. ITEM 7A.
